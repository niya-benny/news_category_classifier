Reuters Australia would buy up to five Virginia-class attack submarines from the US - seen here in Western Australia earlier this year - under the Aukus deal

The US has launched a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, saying the security pact must fit its ""America First"" agenda. Under the trilateral pact, believed to be aimed at countering China, Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs from the US, before the allies create a new fleet by sharing cutting-edge tech. Both Australia and the UK - which did its own review last year - have played down news of the US probe, saying it is natural for a new administration to reassess. The move comes as both Australia and the UK face pressure from the White House to lift military spending, demands heeded by Downing Street but largely resisted by Canberra.

The Aukus agreement - worth £176bn ($239bn; A$368bn) - was signed in 2021, when all three countries involved had different leaders. A US defence official told the BBC the pact was being reviewed ""as part of ensuring that this initiative of the previous administration is aligned with the President's America First agenda"". ""As [US Defence] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth has made clear, this means ensuring the highest readiness of our servicemembers [and] that allies step up fully to do their part for collective defence,"" the defence official said. The US has been pushing allies to start spending at least 3% of GDP on defence as soon as possible. The UK has agreed to spend 2.5% of GDP on its defence by 2028, and 3% by the next parliament, while Australia has also said it will lift funding, but not to the 3.5% that the US wants. The review will be headed up by Elbridge Colby, who has previously been critical of Aukus, in a speech last year questioning why the US would give away ""this crown jewel asset when we most need it"". Defence Minister Richard Marles, speaking to local Australian media on Thursday morning local time, said he was optimistic the deal would continue. ""I'm very confident this is going to happen,"" he told ABC Radio Melbourne. ""You just need to look at the map to understand that Australia absolutely needs to have a long-range submarine capability."" Some in Australia have been lobbying for the country to develop a more self-reliant defence strategy, but Marles said it was important to ""stick to a plan"" - a reference to the previous government's controversial cancellation of a submarine deal with France in favour of Aukus. An Australian government spokesperson told the BBC it was ""natural"" that the new administration would ""examine"" the agreement, adding the UK had also recently finished a review of the security pact between the long-standing allies. There is ""clear and consistent"" support for the deal across the ""full political spectrum"" in the US, they said, adding Australia looked forward to ""continuing our close cooperation with the Trump Administration on this historic project"". A UK defence spokesperson told the BBC it was ""understandable"" for a new administration to look at the deal, ""just as the UK did last year"". Aukus is a ""landmark security and defence partnership with two of our closest allies"", the spokesperson said, and ""one of the most strategically important partnerships in decades, supporting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic"".

Jennifer Kavanagh, from American thinktank Defense Priorities, told the BBC that the US was ""absolutely right to take another look at this deal"" as its submarine capacities were already stretched. ""The US cannot meet its own demand for these nuclear-powered submarines,"" she said. The other concern the US might have is whether Australia would use the submarines they buy in the way the US wants them to, she said, particularly if conflict erupts over Taiwan. Dr Kavanagh said the review might see the security pact shift its focus away from providing submarines to sharing other long-range weapons technology. However, if the US were to pull out of the deal, China would ""celebrate"" as they have long criticised the deal, Dr Kavanagh added.

What is Aukus?

For Australia, the deal represents a major upgrade to its military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology. Such submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia would also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. It is a big deal for the US to share what is often called the ""crown jewels"" of its defence technology. But arming Australia has historically been viewed by Washington and Downing Street as essential to preserving peace in a region they themselves aren't a part of.",World

Getty Images Australia is set to buy up to five Virginia-class attack submarines from the US

A multi-billion dollar submarine deal between long-standing allies - Australia, the UK and the US - has come under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it was reviewing how the deal fits in with its heavily-touted ""America First"" agenda. The Aukus security pact, Australia's biggest ever defence project, is set to play a key part in the country's ability to replace its ageing Collins-class submarine fleet - and, crucially, its military standing in the region. The 30-day review will be led by Elbridge Colby, who has previously been critical of Aukus. In a speech last year, he questioned why the US would give away ""this crown jewel asset when we most need it"". A US defence spokesperson said the review is about ensuring ""this initiative of the previous administration is aligned with the President's America First agenda"". Fears the review may torpedo the deal have been downplayed by the UK and Australia, with both saying the review is a normal process when a new government takes power.

What is Aukus?

Billed as a trilateral security partnership, the Aukus deal - worth £176bn ($239bn; A$368bn) over 30 years - involves two so-called pillars. Pillar 1 is about the supply and delivery of nuclear-powered attack submarines. Australia will buy three second-hand Virginia-class submarines from the US from 2032 with options to purchase two more. After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine model for the UK and Australian navies. This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries. Pillar 2 is about the allies collaborating on their ""advanced capabilities"". This involves sharing military expertise in areas such as long-range hypersonic missiles, undersea robotics and AI.

What's the purpose of the deal?

At its core, the deal is believed to be about countering China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and its role in rising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. While none of the allies have directly pointed at China as a reason for the deal, the three countries have spoken about how regional security concerns have ""grown significantly"" in recent years. China condemned the agreement as ""extremely irresponsible"" when it was first announced. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it ""seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race"".

Who negotiated it?

The deal was unveiled in September 2021 by three former leaders: Australia's Scott Morrison, the UK's Boris Johnson and the US's Joe Biden. The UK reviewed the security pact last year after Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government won the general election.

What does Australia get out of it?

For Australia, the deal represents a major upgrade to its military capabilities. The country is set to become just the second to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology, after the UK. Such submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet. They would also mean Australia would be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. Under the deal, sailors from the Royal Australian Navy are due to be sent to US and UK submarine bases to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.

Watch: Surveillance video shows immigration raid at Westchester Hand Wash

When immigration agents pulled up outside a Los Angeles car wash on a quiet Sunday afternoon, it sparked instant chaos. Some customers at the Westchester Hand Wash, which sits in the centre of a busy shopping area just blocks from the city's airport, froze as the officers in olive-green uniforms approached, CCTV footage obtained by the BBC shows. Two employees who spotted them ducked behind a luxury SUV they were wiping down with a rag. Another worker halfway through cleaning the back window of a car looked up. Then all at once they scattered and ran, some jumping over a nearby fence as agents raced after them on foot and in US Customs and Border Protection pick-up trucks. Agents came the following day to make more arrests.

Courtesy of Noemi Ciau Jesús Cruz had worked at the car wash for 10 years

Jesús Cruz, who has worked at the car wash for more than a decade and lived in the US for more than 30 years, was among the six men who were arrested over the course of two raids. His wife, Noemi Ciau, told the BBC she was shopping with her daughter when she spotted a social media post about a possible raid. It included a photo of the car wash, so she dropped her daughter at home and raced there. By the time she arrived, however, she was too late. She has not been able to reach her husband since. ""You are so used to having a partner there, just to help you out, to be the backbone… now it's like - how am I going to do it?"" she said. ""My husband has no criminal background. He's never gotten a ticket before. We pay our taxes. We're up to date on everything."" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to an inquiry about Mr Cruz's legal status or the goal of the operation at the car wash. That raid and similar ones across Los Angeles represent a significant escalation in the White House's strategy to round up and deport undocumented migrants. On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump repeatedly said he would prioritise deporting noncitizens accused of violent crimes. That promise received widespread support, even among Hispanic immigrant groups. But in recent weeks, the administration has stepped up its targets, pushing to increase their arrests from about 660 to 3,000 a day. Who has been arrested by ICE under Trump? To do that, they have widened their net, targeting not just criminals but workplaces where many undocumented workers do jobs that are vital for the economy - from farming to factory work - and pay taxes. ""Just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,"" Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, reportedly told Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials before they launched the recent LA raids. According to the Wall Street Journal, he told them they did not need to produce target lists of suspected illegal immigrants, a longstanding practice, and should instead raid major businesses to arrest as many as possible.

Car-wash owner Mehmet Aydogan said the agents did not ask for IDs before placing the men in handcuffs and swiftly driving them away. ""They were not doing anything criminal,"" he said, noting the raids were quick and lasted less than a minute. ""Everyone is hardworking."" Days earlier, another operation at Ambiance Apparel, a clothing wholesale business in the Fashion District near downtown LA, had set the city on edge. More than a dozen people were arrested, witnesses said, although DHS did not respond to a BBC inquiry about this operation and the total number of arrests. Border tsar Tom Homan denied that agents were conducting an immigration raid at Ambiance. He said it was a criminal investigation that also uncovered undocumented immigrants. ""I said it from day one: if you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table,"" he told the New York Times recently. Enrique Lopez was one of several witnesses who started posting on Instagram about the operation, before a large group of protesters formed outside, trying to prevent the workers from being taken away. Officials eventually deployed flash bangs and tear gas to push past the crowd - one of the first protests in the LA area as the spate of immigration raids kicked off. ""It's sad that it's hardworking people,"" he said about those arrested. ""And they're trying to make it seem like it's bad people."" Protests first broke out on 6 June, with confrontations between demonstrators and federal agents in the streets, before spreading more widely and at times turning violent. Hundreds have been arrested and an overnight curfew in one area is being enforced. Immigration enforcement agencies have said the protests will not deter their operations. President Trump has deployed the National Guard and US Marines to help ensure the immigration crackdown continues.

These raids have hit Los Angeles County especially hard, where estimates suggest more than 900,000 people do not have legal status - about 10% of the population. Hispanics here outnumber any other ethnic background by a large margin - and many in the community who are citizens or legal residents have family who are undocumented. ""I can't emphasise enough the level of fear and terror that is in Angelenos right now,"" the city's Mayor Karen Bass said at news conference. ""Not knowing if it's tomorrow or tonight. It might be where they live. It might be their workplace. Should you send your kids to school? Should you go to work?"" Calm returns to Los Angeles after hundreds arrested

How Trump's immigration raids sparked protests and unrest

Newsom v Trump holds promise and peril for California governor Social media has been used to inform communities about sightings of immigration authorities, but also to spread misinformation. The unease caused one local minority non-profit to urge undocumented people to just stay out of sight. It offered volunteers to run errands or go grocery shopping for families so they can remain indoors. Residents say it's a mystery when and where immigration officers will show up next. Immigration agencies do not typically announce where raids have happened, nor do they announce all arrests or where detainees are being held or jailed - adding to the anxiety.

But what exactly comes next as raids continue is still unknown. Raids nationwide in recent days have netted hundreds of arrests, including recent operations in agricultural sectors and a meat-packing plant in Nebraska. In response, protests have spurred in all corners of the country - including in major cities like New York, Dallas, Washington and Boston. ""California may be first - but it clearly won't end here,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said in an evening address on Tuesday. ""Other states are next."" Immigration attorney Karla Navarrete, who is representing multiple people who have been arrested in the immigration sweeps, said the mass arrests have overwhelmed the system. Databases aren't being updated with arrests, families and lawyers cannot find those who have been detained and when they do the person sometimes is in a different state or has already been deported to another country. Ms Ciau, whose husband was arrested at the car wash, said she learned late on Tuesday that he was no longer in Los Angeles, or even the state of California. She was told by her lawyer that Mr Cruz is being held at a detention centre in El Paso, Texas, more than 800 miles (1,300km) from their home. Her youngest child - a five-year-old boy - is having the hardest time with the change, she said. ""He just keeps asking for his dad. I don't know what to tell him,"" she added, through tears. ""He doesn't understand what is going on. He still thinks his dad is at work.""",Automobile

Talks aimed at cooling tensions between the US and China have ended in a ""deal"", according to US President Donald Trump. He said China had agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US would walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. ""Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval from President Xi and me,"" Trump wrote on his media platform Truth Social. It followed two days of intense talks in London to resolve conflicts that had emerged since the two sides agreed a truce in May, after a rapid escalation of tariffs had nearly paralysed trade between the world's two largest economies.

But the limited nature of the announcement underscored questions the White House is facing about whether its tariff strategy can quickly yield solid trade deals. Speaking on Thursday, President Trump said he will set unilateral tariff rates with trading partners in the next one or two weeks. The US president said he would send out letters specifying the terms of the new deals ahead of a 9 July deadline to reimpose higher tariffs on countries around the world. Separately, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected the US would extend the existing pause on some of its most aggressive tariffs to allow trade talks with other countries to continue. Details about the new agreement with China were limited. Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping spoke over the phone last week to kickstart the negotiations, which involved top officials from both countries. Officials said it would not alter the broad outlines of the May truce, which lowered - but did not eliminate - new tariffs announced by the two countries since Trump launched a new trade war earlier this year. ""The two sides have, in principle, reached a framework for implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state during the phone call on 5 June and the consensus reached at the Geneva meeting,"" China's Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters the two sides had ""reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus"". ""Once the presidents approve it, we will then seek to implement it,"" he added. Speaking to broadcaster CNBC on Wednesday, he said the talks had ""cleaned up"" the Geneva agreement. ""We're totally on the right track,"" he said. ""Things feel really good.""

Getty Images Top officials from the US and China have been meeting in London

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was currently reviewing the details of the deal. ""But what the president heard, he liked,"" she added. The negotiations in London were triggered in part by US concerns that China was being too slow to release exports of its magnets and rare earth minerals, which are essential for manufacturing everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. Beijing in turn has criticised controls the US has put in place to limit the country's access to semiconductors and other related technologies linked to artificial intelligence (AI) and the Trump administration's plans to limit visas for Chinese students. Speaking to CNBC, Lutnick said the US had agreed to remove some ""counter-measures"" without being specific about the response. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was testifying before Congress on Wednesday, said the recent talks had been narrowly focused and a more comprehensive deal would take time. ""It will be a much longer process,"" he said. In the same hearing, he acknowledged that trade talks with other countries might extend beyond the administration's self-declared 90-day deadline. ""It is highly likely that for those countries that are negotiating - or trading blocs, in the case of the EU - who are negotiating in good faith, we will roll the date forward to continue the good-faith negotiation. If someone is not negotiating, then we will not,"" he said.",Science

Watch: Trump says US personnel ""being moved out"" of the Middle East

Non-essential US embassy staff and their dependants in Baghdad are to be evacuated from Iraq due to heightened security risks, US government sources have said. Officials did not say exactly what prompted the removal, but have been told Israel was ready to launch an operation into Iran, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. This was part of the reason some Americans were advised to leave the region, officials said, adding that they anticipated Iran could retaliate on certain US sites in Iraq. It comes as US talks over Iran's nuclear programme appear to have stalled in recent days.

US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning on holding talks with Iran about its nuclear program on Sunday, officials told CBS. Witkoff will meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Muscat, Axios reported. A US state department official told the BBC: ""We are constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all our embassies. ""Based on our latest analysis, we decided to reduce the footprint of our mission in Iraq."" Speaking at the Kennedy Center, US President Donald Trump told reporters Americans were advised to leave the region ""because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens"". Trump also reiterated that the US did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. ""We're not going to allow that,"" he said. The president has hoped to strike a deal to stop Tehran developing a nuclear weapon. Earlier this week, he held a 40-minute phone call, which was said to be ""tense"", with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long argued for a military rather than diplomatic approach.

Watch: BBC joins malnourished baby on journey to Jordan for treatment

The cry was frail but I could hear Siwar Ashour even before she was carried out of the coach. It was the cry of a voice that won't give up, of a child born in this war and who has now, for a while at least, managed to escape it. In person six-month-old Siwar is tinier than any visual image can convey. She weighs 3kg (6.6lb) but should be twice that. Her mother, Najwa, 23, smiled as she described her feelings on crossing into Jordan on Wednesday, when her daughter was evacuated from Gaza with other Palestinian children. The first thing she noticed was the quiet. ""It feels like there is a truce,"" she told me. ""We will spend our night without rockets and bombing with God's will."" Siwar was also accompanied by her grandmother Reem and her father Saleh who is blind. ""The first and last goal of this trip is Siwar,"" said Saleh. ""We want to get her to a safe shore. I want to make sure she is safe and cured. She's my daughter, my own flesh and blood. And I'm so deeply worried about her.""

Baby Siwar, with her grandmother and mother

It was Reem who carried Siwar off the bus onto Jordanian soil, forming her fingers into a V sign as she came. ""Until now I can't believe that I have arrived in Jordan. I saw King's Abdullah's photo at the border and I felt so happy I got off the bus and made the sign of victory…for the sake of Siwar."" Back in April when the BBC first filmed Siwar at Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, her mother and doctor said she was suffering from malnutrition because the special milk formula she needed could not be found in sufficient quantity. Her body was emaciated. Najwa said then she could not breastfeed Siwar because she herself was suffering from malnutrition. Tins of milk formula were found and delivered by the Jordanian Field hospital and by private fundraisers. But with an Israeli blockade on aid, which was partially eased three weeks ago, and an escalating military offensive it was clear Siwar's condition needed more comprehensive testing and treatment. In a deal announced between King Abdullah and US President Donald Trump in February, Jordan offered to bring 2000 seriously ill children to Amman for treatment. Gaza's devastated medical system cannot cope with the level of sickness and war wounded. Since March, 57 children along with 113 family escorts have been evacuated. Sixteen children came on Wednesday, including Siwar. Cradled in her grandmother's arms, Siwar stared with her large eyes at the unfamiliar crowds of police, medical workers, and journalists gathered on the border.

Siwar weighs just 3kg (6.6lb), half of what she should be

She was taken to an air conditioned hall where Jordanian medics handed out drinks and food to the children. There was peace and plenty. What was most obvious was the exhaustion of parents and children alike. In several months of covering these evacuations this latest was the most striking in terms of a sense of communal trauma. All of these families know what it is to be driven from one area to another by Israeli evacuation orders, or to queue for hours in the hope of finding food. If they have not experienced death in their family, they will definitely know friends or relatives who have been killed. Families are often separated by conflict as parents search for food or medical treatment. One day Najwa took Siwar to hospital and that was the last time husband Saleh was with them for two months. ""I thought she would be gone for just three or four days and then come back, a simple treatment and she'd return,"" he recalled. ""But I was shocked that it dragged on and took so long…and eventually I realised that her condition is very serious and difficult.""",World

Although visible flames have significantly reduced following firefighting efforts, the blaze remains active in the inner decks and near the fuel tanks, the ministry said.

The MV Wan Hai 503, which caught fire on Monday, is carrying 2,128 tonnes of fuel and hundreds of containers - including hazardous cargo - raising environmental concerns.

The Indian defence ministry on Wednesday said that the situation remains critical and efforts are under way to establish a tow line and pull the vessel away from the coast.

The Indian Coast Guard is trying to tow a burning Singapore-flagged cargo ship away from the coast of Kerala in the Arabian Sea, to prevent ""a potential ecological disaster"".

It added that five salvage team members and an aircrew diver have been sent to help with the towing operation.

""The situation remains critical and is being monitored continuously.""

The vessel, which was heading to Mumbai city on India's western coast from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, caught fire after an internal container explosion.

Eighteen crew members have been rescued so far but four others are still missing and a massive rescue operation has been launched to find them.

The Indian Coast Guard said that conditions at sea remain unfavourable and that their priority was to extinguish the fire and prevent a marine disaster.

It has deployed five ships, two aircraft and a helicopter to help douse the fire. A separate salvage team appointed by the ship owner, along with two vessels from the shipping ministry, are also helping with the efforts.

This is the second shipping incident to have happened off Kerala's coast in less than three weeks.

Last month, a Liberian-flagged vessel carrying oil and hazardous cargo leaked and sank in the Arabian Sea, triggering an environmental emergency.

The Kerala state government swiftly banned fishing within a 20-nautical mile radius of the shipwreck and announced compensation for families from fishing communities in four affected districts.

An underwater operation has been launched to cap the ship's oil tank and salvage its fuel.

Manorama News reported that on Wednesday, the Indian Ministry of Ports issued a formal notice to the vessel's management company, warning of legal action if extraction of oil from the ship is not started by Friday.

""The progress made in this operation is grossly inadequate and continues to fall short of the timelines and operational commitments previously provided by the salvors and owners,"" it said.

A woman obsessed with K-pop group BTS has been caught trying to break into band member Jungkook's home just hours after he completed military service.

All seven BTS members are set to be discharged from the military by the end of this month and their agency Hybe has hinted at a reunion.

They went on hiatus in 2022 at the height of their global fame.

Hundreds of fans, some of whom flew in from overseas, had gathered in front of Hybe's headquarters to celebrate their idols' return.

Many of them were dressed in purple, BTS's signature colour, and carried large banners and photographs of the band.

Jungkook thanked fans for travelling to see him, adding that he was ""a bit embarrassed"" after not being in front of cameras for a while.

""I didn't even put on makeup,"" he said.

South Korea requires all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 to serve for about two years in the military.

Exceptions are sometimes made for Olympic medallists and classical musicians.

Before BTS enlisted, South Korea saw furious debate over whether or not they should be allowed to skip the service, with some arguing that they had already served their country by earning it billions of dollars, and that it would be more beneficial to allow them to carry on doing so.

The band had previously won a deferral in 2020, when the nation's parliament passed a bill allowing them to delay their duties until the age of 30.

Interview from 2011: How music takes Brian Wilson back to the 1960s

The surviving original members of the Beach Boys have paid tribute to Brian Wilson, their legendary frontman and co-founder, who has died at the age of 82. They recognised his ""genius"", with Mike Love saying his ""musical gifts were unmatched"" and had ""changed the course of music forever"". Al Jardine recognised his humour and said he ""will always feel blessed"" to have had Wilson in his life. Wilson's family said they were ""heartbroken"" and ""at a loss for words"" to announce his death. Their statement did not give a cause. The Beach Boys were one of America's biggest bands, whose success rivalled the Beatles in the 1960s.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, Jardine said: ""He was a humble musical giant, and his huge musical intellect was apparent quite early on. At the same, time, he didn't need or want attention, was only interested in making the best possible music."" Jardine added Wilson should be remembered ""as a real gentleman, a real musical intellect, who taught the world how to smile"". Born in 1942 and raised in Hawthorne, California, Wilson formed a group with his younger brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine. They went on to sell more than 100 million records globally, according to the group's website. Brian Wilson obituary: Troubled genius who wrote most of The Beach Boys' hits Music magazine Rolling Stone ranked them at 12 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Wilson churned out dozens of hit singles, including the three number one songs I Get Around, Help Me, Rhonda and Good Vibrations. He was known for using the recording studio to create unique sounds, especially on the album Pet Sounds, which contributed to his reputation as a music pioneer. Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan said: ""Heard the sad news about Brian today and thought about all the years I've been listening to him and admiring his genius. Rest in peace dear Brian"". Sir Elton John described him as a ""true giant"" who had the ""biggest influence"" on his songwriting. Frank Sinatra's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, who enjoyed a high-profile music career around the time of The Beach Boys' heyday, shared a picture with Wilson on Instagram. ""His cherished music will live forever as he travels through the Universe and beyond,"" she wrote. ""God bless you, sweet Brian.""

Mick Fleetwood, of the band Fleetwood Mac, wrote: ""Anyone with a musical bone in their body must be grateful for Brian Wilson's genius magical touch !! And greatly saddened of this major worldly loss!!"" Sean Ono Lennon, son of Beatles frontman John Lennon and Yoko Ono, called Wilson the ""American Mozart"" and a ""one of a kind genius from another world"". ""Anyone who really knows me knows how heartbroken I am about Brian Wilson passing,"" he wrote on X. ""Not many people influenced me as much as he did. I feel very lucky that I was able to meet him and spend some time with him. He was always very kind and generous."" Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood said his ""world is in mourning"", as he noted that Sly Stone and Wilson both died this week. Universal Music Group's chief executive Sir Lucian Grainge called Wilson ""one of the most talented singer-songwriters in the history of recorded music"". ""If there was a human being who made art out of inexpressible sadness it was Brian Wilson,"" the musician Questlove wrote in a long tribute on Instagram. Gene Simmons of Kiss remembered Wilson as a ""visionary"", adding: ""Thank you for a lifetime of wonderful melodies that spanned decades.""

Paris Baguette operates six stores in France and three outlets in the UK

Head into the basement of any bustling mall in Singapore and the chances are you will smell the sweetness of fresh, buttery baked goods.

Long lines of people swarm the counters of Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese and Singaporean bakeries – tray and tongs in hand, after picking out cream rolls and milk breads or filled croissants and fruity pastries from crowded display cabinets.

For Paris Baguette, its inspiration is clearly in the name, the outlets are also decorated with the colours of the tricolour, the signage shows the Eiffel Tower and the ambience seems to be aiming for something close to the charm of a Parisian cafe.

But it is 100% Korean.

""I wouldn't limit our bread to everything from France. We are an international brand,"" says Jin-soo Hur, president and chief executive of SPC Group, which owns Paris Baguette.

""Like croissants, could you say this is a European product? I would say it's a universal product.""

SPC traces its roots back to a small family-owned bakery shop that opened 80 years ago.

It is now a key player in mass producing bread and pastries in South Korea, employing 20,000 people across all its brands. SPC says its sales hit $5.6bn (£4.26bn) last year.

In 1988, Paris Baguette was born becoming the first Korean bakery brand to open an international store in China, which continues to be a big market.

Today it has 4,000 stores across 14 countries including in Asia, Europe and the US.

Paris Baguette has big overseas expansion plans, setting a target of more than 1,000 new branches internationally by 2030 – many of them in the US.

It's investing in a factory in Texas which will become its largest overseas production facility when it is completed in 2027, supplying the US, Canada and Latin America.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr1rk5nvxo,"US-backed aid group says Hamas killed five Palestinian staff in bus attack

The US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began delivering aid to Gaza last month

The system started operating on 26 May, to bypass the United Nations (UN) and other established organisations to distribute aid in Gaza.

The BBC cannot independently verify the statement, and Hamas has not commented but it previously denied it had threatened the foundation's staff.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said the attack happened on Wednesday night as the bus carrying more than two-dozen workers travelled to a distribution centre in southern Gaza, and that it came after days of threats from Hamas.

The new group backed by Israel and the US for aid distribution in Gaza says Hamas attacked a bus transporting some of its Palestinian workers, killing at least five people.

Since then, its work has been marred by controversy and violence, with deadly incidents happening near its hubs almost every day.

The UN, which has refused to co-operate with the system, and aid organisations say it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

On Wednesday, local doctors said dozens more Palestinians were killed or injured by Israeli soldiers as they tried to access food at the foundation's distribution centres.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said the attack followed days of threats from Hamas - and that they feared some workers had been ""taken hostage"".

""We condemn this heinous and deliberate attack in the strongest possible terms,"" it said in a statement.

The Israeli military did not immediately corroborate the allegation, but shared part of the GHF's statement, adding: ""Hamas will stop at nothing to maintain control and prevent the effective delivery of aid"".

On Saturday, the GHF accused Hamas of making threats that ""made it impossible"" to operate in Gaza. Hamas denied this and said the GHF operation had ""utterly failed on all levels"".

The GHF's mechanism has been criticised as insufficient, as a limited amount of supplies is being handed out, and inhumane, as it requires people to travel to crowded distribution hubs, at great risk.

Almost every day since it began operating, there have been deadly shootings near one or other of the four centres it has opened, by Israeli soldiers and armed Palestinians.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 200 people have been killed and nearly 2,000 others injured while trying to reach areas designated for aid distribution during that time.

On Wednesday, at least 25 people were killed near a GHF convoy in Gaza's Netzarim corridor, according to two hospitals in Gaza City.

The GHF had earlier said that 43,000 food parcels were handed out ""without incident"" across Gaza.

The US and Israel say delivering aid through the GHF will prevent it being stolen by Hamas. The UN says this is not a widespread issue, while Hamas denies doing it.",World

2 hours ago Share Save Anne Soy BBC News, Kakuma Share Save

BBC Children on the ward are given milk every three hours in a bid to boost their intake of nutrients

Hundreds of thousands of people are ""slowly starving"" in Kenyan refugee camps after US funding cuts reduced food rations to their lowest ever levels, a United Nations official has told the BBC. The impact is starkly visible at a hospital in the sprawling Kakuma camp in the north-west of the East African nation. It is home to roughly 300,000 refugees who have fled strife in countries across Africa and the Middle East. Emaciated children fill a 30-bed ward at Kakuma's Amusait Hospital, staring blankly at visitors as they receive treatment for severe acute malnutrition. One baby, Hellen, barely moves. Parts of her skin are wrinkled and peeling, leaving angry patches of red - the result of malnutrition, a medic tells the BBC. Across the aisle lies a nine-month-old baby, James, the eighth child of Agnes Awila, a refugee from northern Uganda. ""The food is not enough, my children eat only once a day. If there's no food what do you feed them?"" she asks. James, Hellen and thousands of other refugees in Kakuma depend on the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) for vital sustenance. But the agency had to drastically reduce its aid operations in many countries after President Donald Trump announced sweeping cuts to US foreign aid programmes earlier this year, as part of his ""America First"" policy. The US had provided around 70% of the funding for the WFP's operations in Kenya. The WFP says that as a result of the cuts, the agency has had to slash the refugees' rations to 30% of the minimum recommended amount a person should eat to stay healthy. ""If we have a protracted situation where this is what we can manage, then basically we have a slowly starving population,"" says Felix Okech, the WFP's head of refugee operations in Kenya.

Some of the malnourished children at Amusait Hospital can only be fed via tubes

Outside Kakuma's food distribution centre, the sun beats down on the dry, dusty ground and security officers manage queues of refugees. They are led into a holding centre and then a verification area. Aid workers scan the refugees' identity cards and take their fingerprints, before taking them to collect their rations. Mukuniwa Bililo Mami, a mother of two, has brought a jerrycan to collect cooking oil, along with sacks for lentils and rice. ""I am grateful to receive this little [food] but it is not enough,"" says the 51-year-old, who arrived in the camp 13 years ago from South Kivu, a region in conflict-hit eastern Democratic Republic of Congo Ms Mami says the refugees used to ""eat well"" - three meals a day. But now that rations are at 30% of their usual amount, the food she has been given is not enough to last one month, let alone the two that she has been asked to stretch it for. She has also been affected by another casualty of the cuts - cash transfers. Until this year, the UN was giving around $4m (£3m) in cash directly to refugees in Kenya's camps each month, intended to allow families to buy basic supplies. Ms Mami, who is diabetic, used the cash to buy food, like vegetables, which were more appropriate for her diet than the cereals handed out at the distribution centre. Now, she is forced to eat whatever is available. She also used the money to start a vegetable garden and rear chicken and ducks, which she sold to other refugees, at a market. But the discontinuation of the cash transfers, locally known as ""bamba chakula"", has meant that the market faces collapse. Traders like Badaba Ibrahim, who is from the Nuba Mountains in Sudan, are no longer able to extend lines of credit to fellow refugees. The 42-year-old runs a retail shop in the local shopping centre. He says his customers, now unable to purchase food, at times camp at his shop all day, begging for help. ""They will tell you, 'My children have not eaten for a full day,'"" Mr Ibrahim says. Elsewhere in the Kakuma camp, 28-year-old Agnes Livio serves up food for her five young sons. They live in a cubicle, which is roughly 2m (6ft 6in) by 2m made from corrugated iron sheets. Ms Livio serves the food on one large plate for all to share. It is the family's first meal of the day - at 1400.

Single mother Agnes Livio found safety after leaving South Sudan for Kenya

""We used to get porridge for breakfast but not anymore. So, the children have to wait until the afternoon to have their first meal,"" says Ms Livio, who fled from South Sudan. Back at Amusait Hospital, medics are feeding a number of malnourished infants through tubes. Three toddlers and their mothers are being discharged - back to the community where food is scarce and conditions are deteriorating. And the prospect of more funding is not very promising and unless things change over the next two months, the refugees are staring at starvation come August. ""It is a really dire situation,"" admits Mr Okeck. ""We do have some signals from some one or two donors about support with that cash component. ""But remember, the very kind and generous US has been providing over 70% - so if you're still missing 70%… those prospects are not good.""

14 hours ago Share Save Share Save

Reuters

Brian Wilson's work with The Beach Boys made him one of pop music's true geniuses. His songs, including Surfin' USA, California Girls, I Get Around, Good Vibrations and God Only Knows, have become classics. His vision, incorporating complex melodies, intricate harmonies and avant-garde themes, was a watershed in popular music, moving it away from the boy-meets-girl narrative that had dominated the genre. But the pressure of fame combined with increasing dependence on drugs created a prison from which Wilson found it increasingly difficult to escape. Against all the odds, he re-emerged in the new millennium to delight his old fans and capture a new generation of music lovers. Brian Wilson, co-creator of the Beach Boys, dies aged 82 Brian Douglas Wilson was born on 20 June 1942 in the city of Inglewood, California. His domineering and abusive father encouraged his son to practise on toy musical instruments; by the age of eight, he was a consummate piano player and a regular in a local church choir.

Alamy He was developing complex harmonies at an early age

Wilson often encouraged his younger brothers Carl and Dennis to sing along with him in the complex harmonies he was already devising. While at school he excelled in sport, both on the athletics track and as a useful football quarterback. But it was as a 19-year-old that Wilson - who was deaf in his right ear - finally discovered the musical talent that would define his life. He had been given a tape recorder and he soon learned the art of overdubbing, a vital part of what would become the trademark Beach Boys' sound.

Teenage dreams

Staying at home with his brothers Dennis and Carl, while their parents holidayed in Mexico, Brian invited his cousin Mike Love and close friend Al Jardine to rehearse a song that he and Mike had written. The $250 left by Mr and Mrs Wilson for the boys to buy food was used to hire musical equipment. Thus, with the song Surfin', were The Beach Boys born. The following year, with Surfin' having proved a popular debut, the group were signed by Capitol Records. Riding on the ""surf boom"" then enthralling the United States, The Beach Boys were soon enjoying spectacular chart success.

Getty Images The Beach Boys became the only US band to rival The Beatles in the early 1960s

Songs such as Surfin' Safari, Surfin' USA, Fun, Fun, Fun, I Get Around, and Help Me Rhonda celebrated the teenage dreams of surfing, hot rod racing and first romance. While the band traded heavily on the California surfing scene, posing with boards on the beach, it was only Dennis Wilson who was actually keen on the sport. Many of these early hits were written and arranged by Brian Wilson, who also showed a more mature and introspective side on tracks such as In My Room. As the only US band to rival The Beatles, The Beach Boys endured a breathless schedule of recording, touring and promotional work, something that Wilson soon came to both despise and fear.

Sublime

""I have stage fright every single concert I've ever done,"" he later recalled. ""I have at least four or five minutes of it. It's absolute living hell."" The first intimation of his fragile state came in 1964 when he had a mental breakdown during an airline flight. Aged just 22, he decided to stop touring with the band in order to concentrate on writing and producing. Having listened entranced to The Beatles' Rubber Soul album, Wilson responded with his own masterpiece, Pet Sounds.

Capitol Records The mundane cover masked an album of true song writing genius

The album, which featured the sublime God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B, was a huge critical success. But the artistic change of direction that it represented, and the angst-ridden nature of some of its tracks, mystified many listeners. When The Beatles replied with Revolver in 1966, Brian Wilson embarked on writing what he called his ""teenage symphony to God"". But the resulting album, Smile, which would take 37 years to complete, led to Wilson's total mental breakdown and effectively ended his association with The Beach Boys.

Chaotic recording session

Written in collaboration with lyricist Van Dyke Parks, and recorded with a vast coterie of session musicians, the original Smile album, featured groundbreaking songs such as Good Vibrations, Heroes and Villains, and Surf's Up. Wilson, by now increasingly paranoid, installed a large sandpit in his living room, and worked on the album with the aid of a piano in the sand. The chaotic recording sessions featured a bucket of fire and musicians chomping vegetables.

AP By the 1970s Wilson (top left) had withdrawn from the world

The work was dismissed by the other Beach Boys as being too experimental. Most cutting of all, Mike Love - Wilson's co-writer on many of The Beach Boys' biggest hits - damned Smile as ""a whole album of Brian's madness"". Discouraged by the reception given to Smile, and beset by mental illness, Brian Wilson pulled the plug on this work-in-progress in 1967. Despite some limited involvement with The Beach Boys, including working on their 1968 hit single Do It Again, Wilson became a recluse, remaining at home in bed with his thoughts and his cocaine.

Return

In 1976, increasingly worried about their brother, Carl and Dennis hired Dr Eugene Landy, a controversial psychiatric therapist. Moving into Wilson's house, Landy instituted a 24-hour drug watch, overseen by a group of burly minders. Initially, the results were encouraging, with Wilson losing much of his excess weight and making a partial recovery from his drug dependence.

Getty Images Wilson's joy at his return to performing was plain to see

But, after setting himself up as Wilson's business partner and acting as executive producer on his albums, Landy was found guilty of breaching the doctor-patient relationship and promptly left the scene. However, during the 1990s, things started to look up. Wilson married for a second time - his first wife, Marilyn, had left in 1978 - returned to the studio with, initially, little success and was reconciled with his daughters Carnie and Wendy. But it was his discovery of a young Californian band, The Wondermints, that would finally bring Wilson new recognition, after they inspired him to revisit both Pet Sounds and Smile. After fighting his personal demons for 30 years, he made a spectacular comeback with re-workings of his own Beach Boys classics and the revival of the legendary, long-lost, Smile album.

Complex

Wilson gave the first live performance of the substantially reworked Smile at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 2004 and went on to delight audiences around the world. What struck critics and fans was the obvious joy on Wilson's face as he performed. The man who had stopped touring at 22 because of his inability to cope with live performances had finally conquered his fears.

A host of stars joined Wilson in 2014 for a recording of a new version of God Only Knows for a BBC promo

It marked a return to creative form as, in the ensuing years, he embarked on a series of recordings, including an interpretation of Gershwin classics that made number one on the Billboard jazz chart. Wilson said: ""Gershwin inspired me very much. The concept of That Lucky Old Sun was inspired by Rhapsody in Blue - not influenced, but inspired."" In 2012, Wilson officially reunited with the surviving members of the Beach Boys, both for a tour and an album, That's Why God Made The Radio, that represented his first original recordings with the band in more than 15 years. The reunion was also accompanied by the release of The Smile Sessions - a five-CD box set that featured a comprehensive collection of recordings and outtakes from the fabled ""lost"" album, finally giving fans the chance to imagine the record as it could have been.

Experts say the evangelical group's values have increasingly shifted to align with the Christian right, a branch of conservatism that has gained momentum under US President Donald Trump.

The votes on Tuesday came during the annual Southern Baptist Convention in Dallas, Texas, attended by over 10,000 church representatives.

The moment marks the first time the group has officially opposed the ruling in Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 landmark Supreme Court case backing same-sex marriage.

Southern Baptists, whose faith includes over 12 million members in the US, have endorsed a ban to end same-sex marriage in America.

The Southern Baptists' resolution does not use the word ""ban"" directly. Instead, it calls for the ""overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family"".

The resolution also calls ""for laws that affirm marriage between one man and one woman"".

Any legal reversal of the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision would not lead automatically to a nationwide ban of same-sex marriage. Thirty-six states had already legalised same-sex marriage at the time of the ruling, and nearly 70% of Americans still support it, polls show.

""What we're trying to do is keep the conversation alive,"" Andrew Walker, an ethicist at a Southern Baptist seminary in Kentucky who wrote the resolution, told the New York Times.

Although the resolution is non-binding, it comes from a large, influential faction of President Trump's base and sends a direct message to the White House.

Eighty-five percent of white evangelical Protestants are likely to be Republican voters, according to a 2024 Pew Research survey.

""I think there is a confidence that (Trump) will have their backs,"" Kristin Du Mez, a Calvin University history professor specializing in religion and politics, told the BBC.

""In some ways, it's an uphill battle,"" she said. ""But I do think they sense that there's been this shift, that there may be a window opening, and that they think this is the right time to press this issue.""

She described a ""transactional element"" to the relationship between evangelicals and Trump, whose Supreme Court nominations helped end national abortion rights.

Evangelicals also played a ""very prominent"" role overturning Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that protected abortion for nearly 50 years before it was overturned in 2022, said Ms Du Mez.

She said she believes evangelicals may be using the same blueprint to end same-sex marriage.

""I know some of the leaders have pointed to Roe v Wade as a model of the need to play the long game,"" she said.

Trump's message on same-sex marriage has been mixed over the years, telling CNN in 2015 that he supported ""traditional marriage"" then, in a 60 Minutes interview in 2016, saying he was ""fine"" with same-sex marriage.

In his second term, however, he has launched a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) with multiple directives targeting LGBTQ groups. This includes banning transgender people from serving the military, and revoking a Biden-era executive order preventing discrimination ""on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation"".

Fear and anxiety in LGBTQ communities have grown as a result, leading some international organisations to boycott World Pride in Washington DC this year.

And although public support largely remains behind same-sex marriage, the Southern Baptists' resolution has added to LGBTQ groups' sense of alarm.

""This is a very visible example of how attacks on the LGBTQ+ community as a whole have intensified, even as politicians take aim at transgender people as a tactic to divide us,"" Laurel Powell, Human Rights Campaign communications director, said in a statement to the BBC.

Dozens of Palestinians have been killed as they tried to access aid in Gaza, hospitals say. Two hospitals in Gaza City said 25 people were killed overnight, near a convoy transporting flour and a food distribution site run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the area of the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli military zone. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said Israeli forces opened fire. There are also reports of people being crushed by lorries and being shot by Palestinians. Israel's military said troops fired warning shots as suspects approached them. Another 14 people were killed by Israeli fire near a GHF site in Rafah, in the south, a hospital in Khan Younis said.

The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports from Rafah. The GHF said more than 43,000 food parcels were handed out at its three distribution centres in Rafah and central Gaza ""without incident"" on Wednesday. However, there have been deadly incidents near the GHF's sites almost every day since its controversial aid system began operating on 26 May. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 223 people had been killed while trying to reach areas designated for aid distribution over the past two weeks, including 57 on Wednesday.

On Wednesday afternoon, Israeli anti-war activist Alon Lee-Green shared a video showing scenes of total chaos as hundreds of young Palestinian men rush from all directions into a GHF distribution centre to get boxes of food. Many are seen climbing over earth mounds and metal fencing, and there appears to be no organisation or control. BBC Verify geolocated the video to the GHF's Tal al-Sultan site, which is inside an Israeli military zone in western Rafah. It is said to have been filmed on Tuesday. In a post on X, Green described the scene as ""apocalyptic"", adding: ""This is what starving people look like, rushing for food while risking their lives.""

Watch: Video shows crowds rushing for humanitarian aid in Gaza

It came after officials at al-Shifa and al-Quds hospitals in Gaza City said at least 25 people were killed by gunfire from Israeli troops as people gathered early on Wednesday near the GHF's Wadi Gaza site in the Netzarim corridor. The director of al-Shifa's emergency department, Moataz Harara, said the hospital received around 200 injured people at the same time, many of them with gunshot or shrapnel wounds to the abdomen and pelvis. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told news agency AFP that the deaths and injuries were the result of ""Israeli tank and drone fire on thousands of civilians"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement: ""Overnight, IDF troops fired warning shots toward suspects who were advancing while posing a threat to the troops, in the area of the Netzarim Corridor. This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. ""The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured, the details are under review."" Later on Wednesday, officials at Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis said another 14 people were killed by Israeli gunfire near GHF sites in Rafah. For the past few days, people have been saying that Palestinian gunmen have also fired at them. It is not clear whether they were members of militias linked to the Israeli military, or criminal gangs intent on looting supplies from aid convoys. Eyewitnesses have expressed their sense of utter despair. ""They shoot and throw missiles at us, the gangs attack us - everyone attacks us for a bag of flour. They kill their own people for a bag of flour,"" one man said. Another said their child had not eaten in two or three days. ""Our children are being pushed from one community kitchen to another, and the situation is dire. We call on the whole world to stand with the people and demand a ceasefire.

On Wednesday, 12 New York jurors found disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Miriam Haley in 2006, after his previous sex crimes conviction in the state was overturned last year. When Miriam Haley heard the news last year that a New York court had thrown out a rape conviction against Harvey Weinstein, the man she helped put behind bars four years before, she was shocked. In 2020, Ms Haley told a Manhattan courtroom every detail of the time Weinstein sexually assaulted her in his New York apartment in 2006. This time, she was planning to turn down prosecutors, not wanting to put herself through it all again. But just weeks before the retrial, she saw a link to a new podcast series aimed at ""exonerating"" Weinstein. ""I just thought, I have to stand up for myself. I have to stand up for the truth,"" Ms Haley told the BBC. She was one of three women to testify against Weinstein during his six-week retrial, accusing him of using his power as a Miramax Hollywood tycoon to sexually abuse young women. The jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting only Ms Haley. They found him not guilty relating to a second woman and are still deliberating on the third woman's accusations. The verdict ""gives me hope - hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading"", Ms Haley said outside the Manhattan courthouse on Wednesday.

A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April. The judges found Weinstein's original trial was not fair because it included testimony from women who made allegations beyond the official charges against him. In September, the 73-year-old was indicted on sexual assault charges for a new trial. He pleaded not guilty and again vehemently denied the allegations. His lawyers argued at the retrial that his accusers were ""friends with benefits"" who had consensual sex with him in exchange for work opportunities. Those portrayals were insulting, said Ms Haley, adding that Weinstein's continued denial of the allegations pushed her to ""keep showing up"" in court.

Facing Weinstein again

Warning: This article contains distressing content For this trial, Ms Haley spent four days on the stand - three more than she did the first time. This trial, she could look straight at her assailant, who sat in a wheelchair next to the defence table, unlike during the first trial, when he was blocked by the judge's booth. Going in, she worried, as she had in the previous trial, about how she would feel. ""Would I feel intimidated? Would I maybe even feel sorry for him?"" she said. ""And then when I did see him, it was just like nothing."" With Weinstein watching, Ms Haley told the court about their first meeting in France in 2006. She said she went to his hotel thinking they would discuss work opportunities, but Weinstein asked her to give him a massage. She declined and left in tears. They remained in contact, and Weinstein later helped Ms Haley find work as a production assistant for the television show Project Runway. Then, one night she accepted an invitation to his New York apartment, she said, because he had just asked her to attend a movie premiere in Los Angeles. On that evening of 10 July 2006, the film mogul ""lunged"" at her from across a couch and kissed her. He pushed her into a bedroom, where he forcibly performed oral sex on her, Ms Haley testified. ""I couldn't get away from his grip,"" she told the court. ""I realised, I'm getting raped, this is what this is."" Recounting those intimate details to a room full of strangers for the second time was ""exhausting"", Ms Haley later told the BBC. ""It's just so invasive,"" she said.

An 'offensive' cross-examination

After direct questioning, Ms Haley faced cross-examination from Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who is known for her combative style and has defended other major Hollywood figures accused of sexual assault, including Bill Cosby and R Kelly. When Ms Bonjean grilled her about who removed her clothing on that July evening, Ms Haley answered through tears. ""He took my clothes off…I didn't take my clothes off,"" she said. ""He was the one who raped me, not the other way around."" ""That is for the jury to decide,"" Ms Bonjean replied. The comment was disrespectful, said Ms Haley, who added that she could ""feel my eyes balling up, and everything, just because it was just so deeply offensive in that moment"". ""Regardless of the verdict, it still happened, from my perspective,"" she said. ""I'm still the one who has to live with it."" Ms Haley was followed on the stand by actress Jessica Mann, who was involved in Weinstein's first New York trial, and former model Kaja Sokola, who testified for the first time, accusing Weinstein of sexually assaulting her when she was 19. The jury found Weinstein not guilty of assaulting Ms Sokola, and is still deliberating over whether he raped Ms Mann. Weinstein still must serve a separate 16-year sentence for sex crimes in California, meaning he was already expected to spend the rest of his life in prison regardless of the retrial's outcome. In total, he has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.

Billionaire Elon Musk has said he regrets some of the posts he made about US President Donald Trump during their war of words on social media. ""They went too far,"" he wrote on his social media platform X. The two were embroiled in a public fallout after the Tesla owner stepped back from his White House role and called Trump's tax bill a ""disgusting abomination"". His post comes after Trump said he was open to the possibility of reconciliation in an interview with the New York Post on Wednesday. The president said he was a ""little disappointed"" about the fallout, but there were ""no hard feelings"".

""I think he feels very badly that he said that,"" Trump said of Musk's blistering social media barrage. The budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators.

The tech entrepreneur claimed, without evidence, that Trump appears in unreleased government files linked to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The White House rubbished those claims.

The life-sized doll was sold at an auction in Beijing this week

Labubu dolls, sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart, usually cost around 50 yuan.

Labubu dolls are quirky monster characters created a decade ago by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, which have increased in popularity in recent years after a number of celebrity endorsements.

The 131cm (4ft 4in) figurine was sold at the Yongle International Auction in Beijing. The auctioneer said it was now the most expensive toy of its kind in the world.

A human-sized Labubu doll was sold this week for a record 1.08m yuan ($150,324; £110,465), according to a Chinese auction house.

This week's auction was dedicated entirely to Labubu.

Forty eight items were put on sale with around 200 people in attendance.

The auction house said it raised a total of 3.37m yuan.

The figurines have sparked a global buying frenzy after frequently appearing in social media posts by Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink.

The soft toys became a viral TikTok trend after being worn by other celebrities including Rihanna and Dua Lipa.

Former England football captain David Beckham also posted a photo on Instagram of a Labubu attached to his bag.

Earlier this year, Pop Mart pulled the dolls from all UK stores following reports of customers fighting over them.

The Chinese retailer often sells the collectable toys in mystery ""blind boxes"".

These items are popular with customers who only find out the design of the figurine once they have opened the packaging.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5vjqdm1ypo,"Disney and Universal sue AI firm Midjourney over images

Darth Vader is one of the characters the two studios allege Midjourney uses to generate images

It is part of the entertainment industry's ongoing love-hate relationship with AI. Many studios want to make use of the technology but are concerned that their creations could be stolen.

The two studios claim Midjourney's tool makes ""innumerable"" copies of characters including Darth Vader from Star Wars, Frozen's Elsa, and the Minions from Despicable Me.

Disney and Universal are suing artificial intelligence (AI) firm Midjourney over its image generator, which the Hollywood giants allege is a ""bottomless pit of plagiarism"".

In the lawsuit filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the studios gave examples of Midjourney-generated images that included Disney characters such as Star Wars' Yoda and Marvel's Spiderman, the Incredible Hulk and Iron Man.

Disney's chief legal officer Horacio Gutierrez said the firm was ""optimistic"" about how AI ""can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity"".

""But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing,"" he said.

In the complaint, Disney and Universal said Midjourney made $300m (£221m) last year alone and is planning a ""soon-to-be-released video service"".

Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said: ""A lot of the images that Midjourney produces just seem to be copies of copyright characters that might be in new locations or with a new background.""

""It doesn't seem like they're being transformed in a creative or imaginative way.""

He added that there is a recognition in copyright law that creativity can build on other works as long as it adds something new.

Randy McCarthy, head of the IP Law Group at US law firm Hall Estill said: ""No litigation is ever a slam dunk, and that is true for Disney and Universal in this case.""

""There are several issues such as terms of service provisions by Midjourney, and basic fair use analysis, that will need to be sorted out by the court before we can determine the likely outcome,"" he added.

Midjourney did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

On its website, the San Francisco-based startup says it has a ""small self-funded team"" with less than a dozen full-time staffers.

It refers to itself as ""an independent research lab.""

The firm is run by David Holz, who previously founded a hardware sensor firm called Leap Motion.

Midjourney lists former Github chief executive Nat Friedman and Philip Rosedale, founder of Second Life, among its advisors.

Hollywood sees both potential upsides and downsides to AI.

PA The British army holds training exercises near Nanyuki in Kenya

A UK soldier accused of raping a woman near a controversial British army base in Kenya allegedly attacked a British national, not a Kenyan, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has confirmed. In a statement the military said the man had been arrested and sent back to the UK following the alleged incident last month near the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk). The allegation is being investigated by the UK military, which has jurisdiction over the matter, and does not involve Kenyan police. The alleged rape is the latest allegation of misconduct made against British soldiers at Batuk, which is near the town of Nanyuki around 200km (125 miles) north of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.

A MoD spokesperson said: ""We can confirm the arrest of a British service person in Kenya in relation to a report of a sexual offence. The service person has been repatriated to the UK and the victim is a British adult, not a Kenyan. ""The matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the UK Defence Serious Crime Command, in accordance with the Defence Co-operation Agreement between the UK and Kenya and we will not comment further."" A UK soldier has previously been accused of murdering a local woman, Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was found dumped in a septic tank in 2012. The UK has said it is co-operating with a Kenyan investigation into her death. The Batuk base was established in 1964 shortly after the East African nation gained independence from the UK. The UK military has an agreement with Kenya under which it can deploy up to six army battalions a year for periods of training at the site. But the British army has faced a string of allegations about the conduct of some UK personnel at the camp. A public inquiry set up by Kenyan MPs last year heard details of alleged mistreatment of local people by British soldiers. The allegations included a reported hit-and-run incident, as well as claims that some British soldiers had got local women pregnant before abandoning them and their children when they returned to the UK.

10 hours ago Share Save Becky Morton Political reporter Share Save

FCDO UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo met earlier on Wednesday

The UK has agreed a deal with the European Union over Gibraltar's status after Brexit. Talks on rules governing the border between Spain and the British Overseas Territory have been ongoing since the UK left the EU in 2020. The UK said the agreement would avoid the need for checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. For travellers arriving at Gibraltar airport, passport checks will be carried out by Gibraltar and Spanish officials.

Spanish border officials would be able to deny entry as it would be possible for British arrivals to continue their travel into Spain and the EU free-travel area without further checks. This is similar to the system in place for Eurostar passengers at London's St Pancras station, where travellers pass through both British and French passport control before boarding international trains. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the deal protected British sovereignty and supported Gibraltar's economy. He said the ""breakthrough"" delivered a practical solution, adding: ""This government inherited a situation from the last government which put Gibraltar's economy and way of life under threat."" Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo also welcomed the agreement, saying: ""I have worked hand in glove with the UK government throughout this negotiation to deliver the deal Gibraltar wants and needs – one that will protect future generations of British Gibraltarians and does not in any way affect our British sovereignty."" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed in a Wednesday evening phone call that the deal ""unlocks significant opportunities to strengthen UK-Spain relations"". Downing Street said Sir Keir also called Picardo to congratulate him on the deal and thank him for ""his years of hard work, commitment, and leadership to reach an agreement"".

Gibraltar is a 2.6 square mile headland to the south of Spain. The UK has had sovereignty over Gibraltar since 1713, although this is disputed by Spain, who claim the territory as their own. The territory's status and that of its border with Spain has been a key sticking point and has remained unresolved since Brexit. An estimated 15,000 people cross the Gibraltar-Spain border every day for work and leisure. Currently, Gibraltar residents can cross using residence cards without needing to have their passports stamped. Spanish citizens can cross using a government ID card. But there were concerns this would end with the introduction of the EU's Entry/Exit system later this year, causing huge delays at the border. The UK said all sides had agreed a clause making clear the final treaty does not impact the territory's British sovereignty. It said there would also be full operational autonomy of the UK's military's facilities in Gibraltar, where the airport is run by the Ministry of Defence and hosts an RAF base. Public opinion in Gibraltar, which has a population of around 32,000, is in favour of keeping British sovereignty. The most recent referendum, held in 2002, saw almost 99% of voters reject a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain. The breakthrough came after Lammy met Picardo and his cabinet in Gibraltar earlier, before the pair headed to Brussels for discussions with EU and Spanish ministers.

Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister José Manuel Albares and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic both hailed the deal as ""historic"", with Sefcovic saying it ""reinforces a new chapter"" in the EU-UK relationship. All parties have committed to finalising a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar as quickly as possible, the UK government said. However, Reform UK criticised the deal, with deputy leader Richard Tice saying: ""Once again this Labour government have shown utter disregard for our overseas territories. This is another surrender."" Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said her party would examine the full legal text of the treaty to see if it met their ""red lines"". ""The Conservative Party in government, and now in opposition has always been clear that any deal must ensure that the sovereignty and rights of Gibraltar are safeguarded in full and must carry the support of the government and people of Gibraltar, as well as protect constitutional arrangements. We also consistently opposed any efforts by Spain to disrupt the flow of goods at the border,"" she said. ""Gibraltar is British, and given Labour's record of surrendering our territory and paying for the privilege, we will be reviewing carefully all the details of any agreement that is reached."" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said the agreement brought the UK ""one step closer to a proper trade deal with the EU"" but added that ""it's vital that Parliament is given the opportunity to scrutinise the details"".",World

Watch: ""It's a big win for everyone"" - Weinstein accusers speak out after verdict

The conviction is in addition to a 16-year sentence that Weinstein has yet to serve after being convicted of sex crimes in Los Angeles.

The jury found him not guilty of an additional sexual assault charge, and has yet to return a verdict on a charge of rape.

A panel of seven female and five male jurors deliberated for five days in the six-week trial before unanimously voting to convict the disgraced film mogul on one of three counts.

Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault in New York, after his sex crimes conviction in the state was overturned last year.

The trial was based on the testimony of three women - former television production assistant Miriam Haley, actress Jessica Mann, and model Kaja Sokola. All three accused Weinstein of using his power in the entertainment industry to sexually abuse them.

On Wednesday, jurors found Weinstein guilty of assaulting Ms Haley, but found him not guilty of assaulting Ms Sokola. They have yet to return a verdict on a rape charge involving Ms Mann, and plan to resume deliberations on Thursday.

Ms Haley said the verdict gave her ""hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading"".

An appeals court overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, finding the 73-year-old did not receive a fair trial in 2020 because a judge allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him beyond the charges at hand.

Weinstein was then indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.

In a statement Wednesday, Weinstein's spokesperson said the trial was ""fair until we got to the jury deliberations"".

""More than one juror had complained that other jurors had preconceived notions and are using their beliefs of Harvey's life as evidence of guilt,"" the spokesperson said. ""We believe there are serious appellate issues and they will be explored.""

Jury deliberations have been tense over the past week. This week, the foreperson accused some jurors of ""attacking"" others and trying to change their minds. He said jurors were considering Weinstein's past and other allegations outside the realm of the case in making decisions. There were also allegations that one juror had threatened to fight another juror.

In the end, the judge said he would give the jury an instruction about only considering the allegations in the case, and nothing else.

Weinstein - who has cancer and diabetes - stayed at Bellevue Hospital rather than Riker's Island jail during the trial. He sat in a wheelchair for the proceedings.

The retrial in New York centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein during his 2020 trial, Ms Mann and Ms Haley.

It also included new allegations from Ms Sokola, a Polish former model and actress, who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her when she was 19. The jury on Wednesday found him not guilty in that assault.

Reacting to the verdict, Ms Sokola said she was “relieved that Harvey Weinstein will be held accountable for some of his crimes”.

“Coming forward was the hardest thing I've ever done. I owed it to myself, and to the other women who survived him, to make sure that the world knows what kind of man Harvey Weinstein is.

“Speaking out was an act of power and it allowed me to reclaim the pride and confidence he tried to take from me,” she added in a statement.

The three women testified for days about the sexual abuse they alleged they endured at the hands of Weinstein.

All three said they met Weinstein when they were young and looking for work opportunities in the entertainment industry. He then forced himself on them during private meetings at hotels and his homes, the women alleged.",Entertainment
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgq7d9qdego,"Syria government says women must wear burkinis at public beaches

Women often dress modestly on public beaches in Syria, but some women do opt for more Western styles of swimwear. The new government previously pledged to govern inclusively.

Private beaches, clubs and pools, as well as hotels with more than four stars, are exempt, the directive said.

The regulations, issued by the tourism ministry, were ""aimed at enhancing public safety standards and preserving public decency"", Syrian state news channel Al-Ikhbariyah al-Suriyah reported.

Syria's Islamist-led interim government has decreed that women must wear burkinis - a swimsuit that covers the body except for the face, hands and feet - or other ""decent"" clothes at public beaches and swimming pools.

Under the new directive, beachgoers and visitors to public pools must wear ""more modest swimwear"", specifying ""the burkini or swimming clothes that cover more of the body"".

The decree added that women should wear a cover-up or loose clothing over their swimwear when they move between swimming areas.

""Travelling in swimwear outside the beach without appropriate cover is prohibited,"" it said.

Men should also wear a shirt when they are not swimming, and are not allowed to be bare-chested outside swimming areas.

The statement said ""normal Western swimwear"" was generally allowed in exempted places ""within the limits of public taste"".

More generally, people should wear loose clothing that covers the shoulders and knees and ""avoid transparent and tight clothing"", the decree added.

The directive did not say whether those who fail to follow the rules would be penalised or how the rules would be enforced. But it did say lifeguards and supervisors would be appointed to monitor compliance on beaches.

It also included other safety regulations around pools and beaches.

Reacting to the new rule, one woman from Idlib in the north-west of the country told the BBC's World Service OS programme that, while she could see both sides of the argument, ""I do think there is a positive to this, from a moral and respectful point of view.""

Celine said: ""Some people and families don't feel comfortable seeing or wearing too much exposed skin and I believe that is a valid perspective.""

But another woman, Rita, who lives in the capital, Damascus, said she was ""not comfortable"" with the new rule, ""especially as we are not used to such laws"".

""In the coastal area, different ladies from different religions all have been going there and until now, we wore what we wanted,"" she said. ""Religious people could avoid those in bikinis. But this law makes us scared of where to go.""

She added: ""We have no problem with the burkini itself, but it's a problem with the concept that the government are controlling this.""

In December last year, Islamist rebel forces led by Ahmed al-Sharaa toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime, bringing years of civil war to an end.

Since then, al-Sharaa, now the country's interim president, has promised to run the country in an inclusive way.

In an interview with the BBC shortly after he took power, he said he believed in education for women and denied that he wanted to turn Syria into a version of Afghanistan - which has severely curtailed women's rights.

In March, Sharaa signed a constitutional declaration covering a five-year transitional period.

The document said Islam was the religion of the president, as the previous constitution did, and Islamic jurisprudence was ""the main source of legislation"", rather than ""a main source"".

The declaration also guaranteed women's rights, freedom of expression, and media freedom.

BBC Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead in a hail of bullets in 2022

It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen. Within hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit. But three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown. Now, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target. His response was coldly articulate. ""In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,"" Brar told the BBC World Service. ""We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.""

Watch the gunmen staking out Moose Wala's house

On a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him. CCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began. Mobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured. In trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern. ""Someone get him out of the car."" ""Get some water."" ""Moose Wala has been shot."" But it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight. A cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived. Six gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as ""encounters"". Yet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky. Goldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada. Our conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.

Sidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora. But it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop. With his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say. He was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. ""In terms of personality, I want to be like him,"" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. ""The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone."" Over a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life. Moose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent. But fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India. Not much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi – orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver. Bishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.

Hindustan Times via Getty Images Lawrence Bishnoi (centre) runs one of the most notorious organised crime groups in India

""The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections… beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,"" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune. This led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police. ""Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime."" Now 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following. ""So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,"" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan. Securing BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.

One of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing. ""Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,"" said Brar. ""Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence."" A friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music. Brar told us that the ""first dispute"" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.

Moose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant. ""That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,"" Brar told BBC Eye. Yet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.

Vicky Middukhera (R) was close to both Bishnoi (L) and Brar

But when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return. The Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement. The Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life. Although he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved. ""Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,"" Brar told BBC Eye. ""We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea. ""So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard."" We put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands? ""Law. Justice. There's no such thing,"" he says. ""Only the powerful can... [obtain] justice, not ordinary people like us."" He went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system. ""He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going."" He appeared unrepentant. ""I did what I had to do for my brother. I have no remorse whatsoever.""",Entertainment

9 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher • @awzurcher North America correspondent Share Save

In a televised address on Tuesday night, California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of a ""brazen abuse of power"". The Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts were terrorising his state's immigrant neighbourhoods, he said. ""California may be first, but it clearly will not end here,"" he warned. ""Democracy is under assault before our eyes."" Newsom's speech was the latest salvo between the US president and the Democrat who heads America's most populous state. The clash between the two leaders presents a formidable challenge to the 57-year-old governor. But it also offers a political opportunity for a man whose term in office ends next year and has his own presidential ambitions. ""This is unquestionably an opportunity for Gavin Newsom,"" said Darry Sragow, a long-time California Democratic strategist.

'He did it on purpose' - Newsom slams Trump for inflaming LA protests

He adds, however, that as the state's governor, Newsom has an obligation to defend California - whether it's in his political interests or not. ""It's a call to duty,"" he said. Trump has accused Newsom of being ""grossly incompetent"" and of failing to adequately respond as some of the Los Angeles protests turned violent. He's dusted off an earlier derisive nickname for the governor, ""Newscum"", and said on Tuesday that he believed arresting him would be a ""great thing"". According to media reports, the White House is considering whether to cut off federal aid to California, including billions of dollars of education grants. ""Gavin Newsom's feckless leadership is directly responsible for the lawless riots and violent attacks on law enforcement in Los Angeles,"" White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""Instead of writing fundraising emails meant to score political points with his left-wing base, Newsom should focus on protecting Americans by restoring law and order to his state."" Newsom called the arrest threat a step toward authoritarianism and said Trump's deployment of military personnel to secure federal buildings and protect immigration officials had inflamed protests that had been isolated and controlled. ""The rule of law has increasingly given way to the rule of Don,"" he said in his Tuesday night address.

Over the past few days, Newsom has become the face of a Democratic Party that has often struggled to present a clear and unified alternative to Trump's Republican administration on the national stage. The governor's set-piece speech, delivered in a suit while standing in front of California and US flags, received widespread press coverage and attracted well over a million views on assorted YouTube channels. Newsom's press team has also been active on social media, comparing Trump to the evil Emperor Palpatine from the Star Wars films. According to the Washington Post, the TikTok followers on his official governor's account have doubled to 897,000 in the past few days. ""There is a very real possibility that Newsom will come out of this with a significant and favourable national profile,"" Sragow said. He says that the more Newsom can outline a story of Trump against California - a state with whom the president has a very clear grudge - the better the chances for the governor to benefit. ""Don't make this into a mano-a-mano shootout between two gunslingers on the streets of Laredo,"" he said. Trump and Newsom have always presented a contrast in stories and styles – the brash outer-borough New Yorker versus the polished San Francisco cosmopolitan. Newsom was elected to office in 2018, in the Democratic mid-term wave election that marked the first major voter pushback against Trump's first presidential term. He promised to make his state a counterpoint to Trump's national right-wing populism, but his political journey hasn't always been a smooth one. He flirted with controversy during the Covid pandemic, as he backed aggressive lockdowns of public spaces – but gathered for a birthday celebration at a posh French restaurant in November 2020. His political opponents, sensing weakness, triggered a recall election in September 2021 – but Newsom won the vote by a comfortable margin.

Watch: National Guard trains for crowd control as protests continue in Los Angeles

Newsom won re-election to a second four-year term in 2022 and became more involved in national Democratic politics, fuelling speculation that he harboured presidential ambitions. He became a high-profile surrogate for Joe Biden's re-election campaign and took to Fox News for high-profile debates with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was at the time running for the Republican presidential nomination, in December 2023. After Trump's re-election last November, Newsom made a noticeable tack to the political centre. He expressed new discomfort with transgender athletes in women's sports, called for curtailing health benefits for undocumented workers, and hosted conservative guests like former White House senior adviser Steve Bannon on his political podcast – provoking the ire of some in the Democratic Party. In January, he toured the devastating fire damage in a Los Angeles suburb with Trump and pledged to work with the new Republican administration in recovery efforts. The Los Angeles protests have brought a sudden and decisive end to that detente, as the two men square off across a deep political divide. Trump has frequently benefitted from having a political foil with which to contrast himself – whether it was Hillary Clinton in 2016, Nancy Pelosi in the latter years of his first presidential term or Joe Biden during his drive back to power. While there are risks for Newsom in this fight – suspension of federal aid to California and the threat of arrest being just two notable ones – it is also a clash he seems more than willing to embrace.",World
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250602-five-works-that-reveal-the-philosophy-of-banksy,"Five works that reveal the philosophy of Banksy

2 June 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save

Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas. From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks.

Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster.

For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism.

On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me.""

Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true.

Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be.

Girl with Balloon, 2002

Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first to be accompanied by an affecting caption connecting the piece to the history of ideas. Among his most famous murals, Girl with Balloon, which portrays a child reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon drifting away from her, first appeared in 2002 in various locations in London, including on the South Bank, alongside the consoling assertion, ""there is always hope"". That conviction, which fuels the ceaseless striving for an ideal that is seemingly unobtainable in the mural (there's no way that balloon is coming back) rhymes richly with aspects of 19th-Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas concerning an unquenchable and irrational ""Will"" as a fundamental force that drives humanity. When, years later, Banksy mischievously concealed a remote-controlled shredder in the frame of a version of Girl with Balloon that came up for auction in 2018, and sensationally destroyed the work before the eyes of aghast auction-goers, he succeeded in upping the ante on Schopenhauer's belief in the futility of desire by boldly manifesting it himself. Where there's a will there's a fray.

Flower Thrower (or Love is in the Air), 2003

Photo of Flower Thrower (or Love is in the Air

Banksy's famous mural of a masked man frozen forever in the instant before he unleashes not a brick or a bomb but a bouquet of flowers may seem, at first blush, to exemplify a pacifist's commitment to peaceful disobedience. The work appears to echo the precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha – a philosophy of non-violence that the Indian ethicist coined in 1919. Banksy's fully flexed figure, incongruously armed with a fistful of beauty, appears to epitomise Gandhi's insistence on wielding moral, not physical, strength. Doesn't it? Or has Banksy slyly subverted the philosophical assertion of pacifistic force by portraying his hero as an enraged rioter? The figure's anger has not been tempered by an appeal to the higher ideals of beauty and truth. Instead, those ideals have been weaponised by Banksy. Here, beauty and truth are not disarming, they are devastatingly explosive.

One Nation Under CCTV, 2007

Photo of One Nation Under CCTV, 2007/ Alamy

Banksy's mural in Marseille employs a tried-and-true technique to ensure the work protrudes into the urban space in which we'll encounter it – elevating its philosophical potential from something flimsy and flat to something undeniably urgent. It's a tactic he used in a 2007 work that appeared near London's Oxford Street in which he depicts a boy atop a precariously high ladder, spray-painting the penetrating observation that we are ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in outlandishly outsized letters. Also portrayed within the mural is a uniformed officer and his obedient police dog who surveil the young vandal, while above them all an actual CCTV camera, presumably recording everything, juts out from the wall. The endless layers of surveillance-within-surveillance to which the work attests – as we watch the state watch an officer watch the boy – captures with uncanny precision the philosophical contours of the vast and all-encompassing prison machine in which the French poststructural philosopher Michel Foucault believed everyone in society was now irredeemably enmeshed. In Foucault's study Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, he resuscitates a blueprint for a prison proposed by the British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th Century, ""The Panopticon"" (meaning ""all seeing""), and uses it as a menacing metaphor for how no one can escape the perniciously penetrating eye of the panoptical state.

Mobile Lovers, 2014

Photo of Mobile Lovers, 2014/ Alamy

Banksy's witty 2014 work Mobile Lovers shines a chilling light on the state of contemporary relationships. The mural depicts a couple whose almost affectionate embrace is interrupted by the deeper fondness they have for the warm glow of their smartphones. The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who died in 1986, may not have lived long enough to witness the emergence of mobiles. Yet her profoundly influential 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity – published exactly 60 years before the iPhone was launched in 2007 – with its exploration of the devastation that detachment and disconnection can wreak on the realisation of our truest selves, is profoundly proleptic of our modern predicament. To be free, de Beauvoir insisted, requires a deep attentiveness to each other. She believed in the authenticity of human encounters, without which life is a futile performance, dimly lit by disposable devices, rather than something profound and meaningful.

How Banksy Saved Art History by Kelly Grovier, published by Thames & Hudson, is out now.

The rich, glamorous, American women of the gilded age who married into the English aristocracy faced some challenges – but they were resilient, formidable characters. As TV's The Buccaneers season two begins, and an exhibition in London is devoted to them, we explore the lives of the women who inspired writers and artists.

Can the new Duchess of Tintagel steer clear of scandal? Will her fugitive sister, Jinny, keep her baby from the clutches of her husband, the monstrous Lord Seadown? Can Mabel and Honoria's forbidden love flourish?

Apple TV+ The TV drama series The Buccaneers is based on the novel by Edith Wharton (Credit: Apple TV+)

The Buccaneers, Apple TV+'s hit period drama, is back for a second season, and its legions of fans expect answers to all of the above. The show charts the romantic adventures of a group of young American women – two pairs of sisters and their friend – who, looked down upon as nouveau riche by older, grander New York families, come to England in the 1870s and cut a swathe through high society. Fast-moving, fun and visually sumptuous, it looks as though the costume budget alone could dwarf the entire expenditure of lesser shows. It is lavish, colourful escapism – yet the unfinished Edith Wharton novel of 1938 upon which it is based was inspired by a real phenomenon.

Edith Wharton had close friends among the British aristocracy, and would have been familiar with various scenarios for these marriages – Maureen Montgomery

Between 1870 and 1914, 102 American women – 50 of them from New York – married British peers or the younger sons of peers, and many more married into the upper classes. They were dubbed ""dollar princesses"" and the popular view was that these were purely transactional marriages – cash for class. The women gained a title and status; the often cash-strapped aristocrats got a welcome injection of money to help them fix the leaking roof of the crumbling family seat.

English Heritage Consuelo Yznaga del Valle, the Duchess of Manchester by John Singer Sargent (1907) (Credit: English Heritage)

""The decline in landed income during the Great Agricultural Depression, beginning in the 1870s, necessitated numerous male aristocrats to seek marital alliances outside the inner social network of the British aristocracy,"" explains Maureen Montgomery, a historian and Wharton scholar who is currently editing The Buccaneers for the Oxford University Press's The Complete Works of Edith Wharton.

""Another factor was the openness of the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, to wealthy businessmen being part of his inner social circle and his penchant for the beautiful and entertaining daughters of the American bourgeois elite who were travelling in ever larger numbers, after the Civil War, to Europe.""

The first inklings of a novel to be called The Buccaneers appear in Wharton's notebook for 1924-1928. There she set out the plot, revolving around the ""conquest of England by American adventurers & adventuresses/families"".

""In the summer of 1928, during one of her many annual trips to England in her later years, she visited Tintagel in Cornwall and stayed with her close friend Lady Wemyss at her Cotswold estate, Stanway,"" Montgomery tells the BBC. ""Both of these places became significant settings for the novel.""

English Heritage The exhibition, Heiress: Sargent's American Portraits, features Cora Countess of Strafford (1908) among other ""dollar princesses"" (Credit: English Heritage)

However, Montgomery doesn't believe that there is any one particular story or person that the writer drew upon.

""Wharton had close friends among the British aristocracy, and went to weekend country house parties. She personally knew a number of titled Americans. She would have been familiar with various scenarios for these marriages, how they were received, the different motives for marrying,"" she says.

Some historians have suggested Consuelo Vanderbilt as one of the possible models for The Buccaneers' Conchita Closson. Considered a great beauty, Consuelo was a ""dollar princess"" whose father made a fortune in railroads. Her dowry was worth tens of millions in today's money. She was more or less bullied by her mother into marrying Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, and was said to have wept behind her veil at the altar on her wedding day in 1895 (one of nine US heiresses to marry English aristocrats that year).

The marriage was deeply unhappy. ""Sunny"", as the Duke was known, wasted little time in telling her he'd only married her for her money and in order to save Blenheim Palace, the ducal seat. In her memoir, The Glitter and the Gold, Conseulo wrote of a Blenheim Palace butler who had drowned himself: ""As one gloomy day succeeded another I began to feel a deep sympathy for him."" Her marriage produced two children but both Consuelo and her husband had lovers.

Consuelo had been preceded into the aristocracy by the godmother after whom she was named. The Cuban-American heiress Consuelo Yznaga Montagu, another model for Conchita, married George Montagu, Viscount Mandeville, in 1876 and became the Duchess of Manchester when he inherited the title. The profligate duke burned through his wife's money and had numerous affairs. Consuelo, who is mentioned in Wharton's notebook, was reportedly very close to the Prince of Wales.

'Swashbuckling beauties'

Both Consuelos feature in Heiress: Sargent's American Portraits, an exhibition of 18 works by John Singer Sargent at Kenwood House on London's Hampstead Heath. The show has been curated by Wendy Monkhouse, English Heritage Senior Curator (South), and is the result of two years' work.

They had a hard time entering British society as foreigners, and foreigners of whom everybody was envious and resentful – Wendy Monkhouse

""There was a real gutsiness about these heiresses,"" Monkhouse tells the BBC. ""They were brave. They had a hard time entering British society as foreigners, and foreigners of whom everybody was envious and resentful and wanted to take down a peg or two because of this 'buccaneer' trope.""

English Heritage Margaret Howard, Countess of Suffolk was a well-known American heiress and married into one of the wealthiest families in Britain (Credit: English Heritage)

They were, supposedly, swashbuckling beauties who leapt aboard the good ship Britannia and, with piratical ruthlessness, bagged themselves a baron or an earl or maybe even a duke. The English newspaper editor WT Stead used the expression ""gilded prostitution"" when writing about these transatlantic marriages.

There was opposition from the US too, at the highest level. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to his ambassador to the UK Whitelaw Reid in 1906, ""I thoroly [sic]… dislike these international marriages… which are based upon the sale of the girl for her money and the purchase of the man for his title."" And plenty of ordinary Americans hated the idea of all that wealth leaving the country and being squandered on wastrel British aristocrats. This wasn't what they'd fought a war of independence for.

But Monkhouse argues that the moniker ""dollar princesses"" does the women a disservice. ""I think it's a term that has been tossed around for a hundred years without very much thought, apart from in academic circles,"" she says. ""The more that you delve into it, the more it falls apart. I think Consuelo Vanderbilt, though she doesn't call herself a dollar princess, sort of defined the genre in that she was a very rich American who was, not by her own choice, married for a title and then was unhappy.""

However, other women whose images are featured in the exhibition had very different stories. Daisy Leiter, glamorous and independent-minded daughter of a Chicago real estate magnate, was considered quite the catch and not just for her money, as Sargent's magnificent portrait shows. She was bombarded with proposals but married Henry Howard, the 19th Earl of Suffolk. It seems to have been a very happy love match and produced three sons. In later life, Daisy further exemplified the adventurous spirit of many of these women by becoming a helicopter pilot.

English Heritage Consuelo Vanderbilt is thought to have partly inspired one of Wharton's characters in The Buccaneers (Credit: English Heritage)

Another of Sargent's subjects was Cora, Countess of Strafford. Her name is echoed by that of a famous fictional ""dollar princess"", Cora, Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey. Julian Fellowes has said that one of the inspirations for the series was a book about American heiresses called To Marry an English Lord. The real Cora was a Southern belle who married the 4th Earl of Strafford after the death of her first husband, toothpaste baron Samuel Colgate. The Earl died just five months after the wedding when he fell on to railway tracks at Potter's Bar. The incident prompted much gossip, as did the fact that Cora wore her coronet sideways at Edward VII's coronation.

One of the best known of the women in the Heiress exhibition, represented in both an oil portrait and a charcoal drawing, is Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, the daughter of a Virginian railway tycoon and the first woman to take her seat as an MP in the House of Commons. She had regular clashes with Winston Churchill, whose own mother, Jennie Jerome, was the daughter of a wealthy New York speculator and financier.

There's a splash of politics in the new season of The Buccaneers that sees Nan realising that her elevated social status gives her power and influence, and beginning to wield it. Buccaneers showrunner Katherine Jakeways read extensively on the ""dollar princesses"" before writing began on the series, and she draws on their stories, as well as the Wharton text.

""You imagine that the girls who came over were interesting to the men because (a) they were beautiful, (b) they were American and (c) they were rich, but actually what's really interesting is that (d) they were much better educated and much more encouraged to be confidently involved in society [than their English counterparts],"" she tells the BBC. ""In New York their opinions were sought whereas girls in England, as we show with Honoria in Season one, were asked not to speak or have an opinion.""

National Trust Images/ Matthew Hollow Viscountess Astor became the first woman to sit in Parliament – she held her seat for 25 years (Credit: National Trust Images/ Matthew Hollow)

Like their real-life counterparts, the women in the show don't conform to reductive stereotypes. ""Our characters are complicated and have depth, and we try to make all the relationships have some kind of resonance for a contemporary audience,"" says Jakeways. ""And hopefully it's just really good fun.""

Season two is another rollercoaster ride that remixes all the successful ingredients from the first series. Will there be a season three? I'd bet an heiress's dowry on it.

The Buccaneers Season Two premieres on Apple TV+ on 18 June.

Heiress: Sargent's American Portraits is at Kenwood House, London, until 5 October.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0j71xgrv8o,"South Korea cements cultural status with six Tonys for Maybe Happy Ending

Maybe Happy Ending is about the romance between two humanoid robots

With the Tonys, South Koreans have now won the four most coveted awards in US entertainment. Squid Game won Emmy awards in 2022 while Parasite won four Oscars in 2020. Soprano Sumi Jo won a Grammy in 1993.

Maybe Happy Ending is about the romance between two humanoid robots living in an apartment building on the outskirts of Seoul. It entered Sunday night's awards ceremony with 10 nominations.

The acclaimed Broadway production of Maybe Happy Ending, which debuted in South Korea almost a decade ago, won six Tonys, including best musical.

South Koreans are celebrating their first win in the Tony Awards, which they say highlights their country's status as a cultural powerhouse.

On Sunday, South Korean lyricist Hue Park and American composer Will Aronson took home the Tony for best original score and best book of a musical.

Before making their Broadway debut with Maybe Happy Ending in 2024, the pair, who met as students at New York University, had written the musical in both English and Korean.

""This is amazing!"" one post on Threads reads. ""I heard the Broadway version got even more polished. I'm so proud that Korea is becoming a true cultural powerhouse.""

""This feels like a dream come true for the Korean Wave,"" reads another post. ""I'm just as thrilled as when Parasite won the Oscars, Squid Game won the Emmys, and Han Kang received the Nobel Prize.""

Former Glee star Darren Criss, who played one of the robots, Oliver, won best lead actor in a musical. It was his first Tony win.

The musical, which also stars Helen J Shen as robot Claire, was already on a streak this awards season.

It bagged some of the top prizes at the Outer Critics Circle Awards and Drama League Awards this year.

First directed by Kim Dong-yeon, Maybe Happy Ending premiered in Seoul in 2016 to much critical acclaim. It has since been revived several times in South Korea and abroad - in both Korean and English.

Maybe Happy Ending's success comes as South Korean artists continue to break ground in entertainment, especially with K-pop acts like BTS and Blackpink dominating music in the last few years.

It also serves as a window into Korean culture, some social media users say.

""It's amazing that Korean elements like Jeju Island, fireflies, and hwabun (a plant pot) were kept in the Broadway version too,"" reads one post on Threads.

Guerrilla Girls

It's been 40 years since the controversial activist group Guerrilla Girls formed. Their most powerful campaign, the ""naked poster"", broke new ground – and has had a lasting influence.

On a Sunday morning in New York in 1989, a few women perused the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Hidden among the regular punters, the anonymous feminist art collective, the Guerrilla Girls, went unnoticed as they carefully counted the number of female artists versus the number of naked women depicted in the artworks. They were on a secret mission to make people care about the racial and gender unfairness of the art world.

""The idea always was to find that kernel that was unforgettable,"" one of the founding members of the Guerrilla Girls, who uses the alias Käthe Kollwitz, tells the BBC at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, ahead of an exhibition that celebrates 40 years of their work.

They made their way through the different rooms – past the male nudes of ancient Greece and the near absence of nudity in the early Christian sections – but it was when they hit the early modern era that they found the statistics that would lead to their biting criticism of the art world. They posed the question of who was allowed to be subject and object in the lofty corridors of the world's most prestigious art institutions.

I don't think anyone who actually looks at that poster can go into a museum and not think about what is on the walls and why – Käthe Kollwitz

""Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female,"" reads the poster, next to a female nude whose head is covered by the group's trademark gorilla mask. The figure is based on the painting La Grande Odalisque, 1814, by male painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.

To this day, the group remains anonymous, and when the BBC interviews Kollwitz, she is wearing the mask. ""I don't think anyone who actually looks at that poster can go into a museum and not think about what is on the walls and why,"" she says.

The Do Women Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met Museum? poster was meant to have been a commission from the New York Public Art Fund, but on seeing the final result, the funding was pulled. The Guerrilla Girls committed to their message and put it on billboards and buses themselves. ""We decided to buy space on NYC buses. We also pasted it up ourselves on NYC streets.""

The poster threw the collective into the spotlight and cemented their style with a mass audience. The mix of humour, statistics and bold advertising slogans was the culmination of several years of working out how to tackle gender and racial inequality. The group's initial two posters – What Do These Artists Have in Common? and These Galleries Show No More Than 10% Women Artists or None at All – were plastered on walls, street lamps and telephone booths in New York, with no need for permission from the decisions of those who ran the powerful art institutions.

The Guerrilla Girls' decision to adopt the language of advertising was in reaction to what they saw as the ineffectiveness of traditional protests. The group formed in 1985 after attending a protest outside the Museum of Modern Art in New York the previous year. The International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture had only featured 17 women and eight artists of colour out of 169 artists.

""A couple of us went to this protest, and it was so clear nobody cared. Everyone just went inside the museum. You know, all these signs about women's art. They didn't believe it for a minute. And that was really the 'aha' moment.""

The ""Naked"" poster, as Kollwitz refers to it, was a game-changer. ""We often have crazy visuals, facts, and humour – things to draw them in – and if you actually look at our posters, you'll never see art quite the same way again.""

'Undeniable change'

Author and podcaster Katy Hessel, in her book The Story of Art Without Men, points to how artists coming up through the '80s had all grown up with televisions in their homes. ""Playing with the media (and art history's) stereotypes of women, they took back control of the gaze and turned it upon themselves.""

They ultimately asked – just how did museums get away with celebrating the history of patriarchy instead of the history of art? – Katy Hessel

""The Guerrilla Girls brought public attention to the inequalities and systematic discrimination in the art world, and ultimately asked – just how did museums get away with celebrating the history of patriarchy instead of the history of art?""

From being an outside force pushing for space, their text-based work now often hangs in the very places they once sought to provoke. Their continued anonymity is another invitation to remember women artists who struggled in their time. All the founding members are art professionals in their own right, but as the Guerrilla Girls, they carry the pseudonyms of deceased artists like Frida Kahlo and Zubeida Agha.

""More than being anonymous, it's the way they do it that is also really clever,"" says Michael Wellen, a senior curator at Tate Modern in London, which has an ongoing free collection of their work on display. ""There's a moment of education every time you're figuring out who you're talking to."" Since their original counting of nudes in the Met, the art world has changed. But inequity between artists of colour and women in comparison to white men still exists. This can be seen not just in who hangs on the walls but in other areas of the art market. For example, artwork by women only accounts for 39% of gallery sales, according to a report by Art Basel in 2024. Recent studies also point out that permanent collections in major US galleries are 85% white and 87% male. In the UK, it was only in 2023 that the Royal Academy in London displayed Marina Abramović's lifetime of work – making her the first woman to have a major solo exhibition in their main galleries.

""I think that there's undeniable change in how museums represent the history of art and contemporary art – and in large part, it's due to the light that the Guerrilla Girls have shone on these inequalities,"" says Wellen.

While the poster protest was originally critiquing who was allowed to hang on the walls of museums and galleries, this focus has evolved for the Guerrilla Girls as well as for other artist activists, who are now scrutinising how funding is secured and where donors earn their money. In 2019, US art photographer and activist Nan Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim, dropping thousands of prescriptions into the atrium in protest against the museum accepting donations from the Sackler family, who own Purdue Pharma, the makers of prescription painkiller OxyContin, which has been blamed for fuelling the US opioid crisis. The protest featured in the documentary The Beauty and the Bloodshed.

The Guerrilla Girls' work has also evolved to take on broader issues, tackling environmental concerns and expanding their signature style globally over the years. The founding members operate like a cell and have collaborated internationally, with approximately 60 contributors across Asia, Latin America and Europe. In March this year, they created a poster with the Bulgarian Women's Fund. Don't They Deserve More Than a Thin Slice of Government? criticised the lack of women's representation in the country's government.

Tracking progress is difficult. Over the years, the Guerrilla Girls have revisited the poster that threw them into the spotlight, conducting recounts. It's a jarring commentary on how little things can change despite public pressure. Between 1989, 2005, and 2012, the number of female nudes in the Met decreased – but the number of women artists actually shrank. Of course, this isn't indicative of every institution, but as always with their work, the message is clear: there is still more to be done.

""I chose her because she was a political artist, and that's what I consider the Guerrilla Girls and myself as well,"" says Kollwitz, when asked why she named herself after the German artist. Born in 1867, the real Käthe Kollwitz's work focused on women, and was profoundly anti-war. Stylistically her work is very different from the Guerrilla Girls, but the thematic content overlaps.

The Guerrilla Girls remain active, and crossing the 40-year threshold is a moment for reflection – but also a time to look ahead. You might expect someone who has been battling injustices for decades with snail-like progress to be exhausted, but Kollwitz says the challenge of progress is what inspires the collective. In November, they will exhibit at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, and a graphic novel is in the works. “We will never stop making trouble,” she says. ""Our fight is not over.""

Guerrilla Girls: Making Trouble is at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington DC until 28 September.

26 February 2024 Share Save Deborah Nicholls-Lee Features correspondent Share Save

Body art has come a long way in the past two decades, from Māori symbolism to the ""warm hug"" tattoo. Here are nine works by a new generation of tattoo artists who are bringing innovation and diversity to this ancient art.

Tattoos have become the ultimate fashion statement. Barely a week goes by without an actor, pop star, sport star or model making headlines with new body art. Ink always starts a conversation, whether it's British TV and radio presenter Maya Jama's tiny new ankle tattoo, a spontaneous decision made in the fog of a hangover; or US rapper Chrisean Rock's widely criticised face tattoo of her ex-boyfriend Blueface to protest against his incarceration.

More like this:

Choosing a tattoo today is radically different from 20 years ago, with tattoo tourists now flocking to talented artists with huge online followings and celebrity endorsements. ""The binders of flash sheets [drawings of tattoo designs] that were once discovered only by word-of-mouth recommendations in the waiting rooms of tattoo shops have found a new home on Instagram to be consumed by anyone around the world,"" writes Alice Snape, editor of Things & Ink magazine, in a new book Tattoo You – A New Generation of Artists, published by Phaidon.

The book brings together 75 of the world’s most innovative tattoo artists, and launches just before the UK's Brighton Tattoo Convention (24-25 February), a mecca for international tattoo talent. The book describes itself as ""a celebration and a snapshot of a new generation of tattooing, showcasing diverse artists, styles and bodies"", and reveals a world where tattooing functions much like clothes, helping people ""to feel at home in their own bodies"".

Today, designs are more varied, and often more detailed, as tools and tastes have evolved; and women, trans and non-binary artists of a range of cultures now take up space in what was once a predominantly white male profession. From reclaiming flesh scarred by surgery, to promoting the culture of marginalised groups, the tattoo artist of today responds to society's evolving needs. As Snape writes in the book: ""Tattooing is a way to hold power in a world that often feels like it is spiralling out of control."" Here are nine extraordinary changemakers:

A tattoo should feel like ""a warm hug"", says Singapore-based artist Ian Damien, who sees tattoo art as playing an important role in body positivity. His bold work flits between complex geometric designs and traditional Japanese imagery, and seeks, he says, to ""preserve history"", as well as ""create new, contemporary visual material"". Damien, whose aesthetic is influenced by the ornate Buddhist temples that his Chinese parents took him to, is just six years into his career, but his eye-popping style and empathetic approach have set him apart. ""Tattooing can help a customer build a better relationship with their body,"" he says in the book. ""It can help make someone feel better and leave this world a better place… one clean line at a time.""

""Getting a tattoo is a very intimate moment, where, historically, power dynamics have been abused by some male artists,"" Argentinian Yanina ""Yane"" Alexandra tells BBC Culture. She estimates that only a fifth of Argentina's tattoo artists are women, and believes that they play an important role in making the industry safer and more inclusive. Her designs, she says, are influenced by album covers, 80s leather culture, film and fashion, and move away from ""the patriarchal mindset"" that depicts women as ""submissive and hypersexualised"". The women in Alexandra's designs are ""voluptuous with great hair"", she says, representing ""power and abundance"". She adds: ""I try to draw women that are strong, defiant, with agency over their own lives and actions"".

""Growing up I wanted to give back and help in my own way with the revival and strengthening of our people,"" says Auckland-based artist Moko Smith, whose Māori heritage is central to his work. ""And for me, the way I can do that is through this art form."" Smith works in a simple studio fashioned from two shipping containers and uses a bone comb and tapping stick to create traditional designs based on the sacred Māori practice of tā moko, the ritual receiving of body art as a rite of passage, as well as original concepts influenced by Māori crafts such as weaving and woodcarving.

By contrast, the tattoo art of Ganji Bang is about overturning traditions. Bringing his Japanese heritage to his workplace in Los Angeles, Bang confronts and subverts Japanese folklore by doing the unthinkable, and inking his clients with yōkai, ghastly supernatural monsters feared to inhabit the body if tattooed on to the skin. Mokumokuren, all-seeing eyes and portents of a yōkai infestation, are a repeated motif, staring out – often in multiples – from fearsome creatures, or stacked up in layers as part of a complex pattern. Bang’s customers include the US rapper Post Malone, who commissioned a Japanese wave design for his left temple in 2018.

Food is the surprising subject of many of the designs of Barcelona-based artist Rion. As a child growing up just outside Paris, she was an avid collector of Manga comic books, and the influence can be seen in her colourful tattoo work, which is cartoonish and cute but often has a sinister underbelly: chicken drumsticks sweat it out in a striped bucket, a dachshund is wedged into a hot dog bun, and dim sum peep over the edges of a bamboo steamer awaiting their fate. ""My inspiration mainly comes from creepy vintage ceramics, vintage advertising illustrations, naïve store signs, vintage toys [and] a lot of music,"" Rion tells BBC Culture. ""My weird brain does the rest of the job.""

Courtesy of artist Paris-based designer Blum makes intricate, lace-like body art, including full bodysuits (Credit: Courtesy of artist)

Blum describes her delicate, lace-like body art as ""permanent skin ornaments"" that can ""change bodies and their aspects"". Flowers, frescoes and ornamental architecture all feed her imagination, which converts the beauty of both the natural and built environment into intricate black designs that begin digitally on Procreate and result in a unique creation for each client. Blum also works as a model and has built up a following of more than 300k on Instagram, where flashes of her latest work sit alongside fashion photos of Blum with her tattooed full bodysuit.

""My tattoo practice aims to include all people,"" Jade F Clark, originally from London, tells BBC Culture. ""This is extremely important to me as a black female tattoo artist who doesn't fit the norms of the tattoo world, and wants people to feel represented through my work."" Clark deliberately creates diverse designs that move away from the standard white male, able-bodied mainstream, which she describes as the ""dominant culture in the Western world"". Colourful works such as cat lady reclaim stereotypes about women, while a Freddie Mercury tattoo inserts a gay icon in the place of a religious one.

One way to make tattooing more inclusive is to invite under-represented groups to receive a tattoo for free. That is what non-binary Chicago artist Janani Nathan did in 2021 in order to attract more South Asian clients and in so doing build a community of people with a common heritage. Nathan's delicate designs draw on Indian folk art and are mostly produced with the traditional hand-poking technique, which they feel creates a more intimate bond between client and artist. Nathan learnt much of their trade at Chicago's My Place Tattoo and Art Studio, described in the book as ""a trauma-informed space for queer people of colour to tattoo and get tattooed"". Creating welcoming spaces for marginalised sectors of society has been central to how Nathan is helping to reshape the tattoo industry.

Sometimes tattoos are about fitting in rather than standing out. British artist Tanya Buxton specialises in cosmetic work, embellishing scars and creating realistic nipple tattoos for people who have had mastectomies or top surgery. For these clients, being tattooed has a huge impact both physically and mentally, she tells BBC Culture. ""You're taking control again, you’re reclaiming yourself. For a lot of people, it is a celebration of life, it's marking a new chapter in their journey now, a way of moving forward."" Tanya's work is helping to dispel stereotypes about tattooing and who it is for. ""I think everyone should know what tattooing is capable of and how it's evolved,"" she says. ""It can be a really life-changing, powerful thing.""

16 January 2017 Share Save Alastair Sooke Features correspondent Share Save

Wikipedia (Credit: Wikipedia)

A short trip to an ancient village was the catalyst for a profound shift in Picasso’s work – but it is often overlooked. Alastair Sooke finds out more.

One day in June 1906, Pablo Picasso arrived in the ancient Catalan village of Gosol, high in the Pyrenees. A friend had tipped him off about this “magnificent” mountain refuge, which was notorious for its smugglers. Intrigued, he had persuaded his mistress, the chic, auburn-haired former artist’s model Fernande Olivier, who had a penchant for French perfume, to go with him on the arduous journey to Gosol from Barcelona, where they had spent a happy couple of weeks catching up with Picasso’s old friends after travelling to the city by train from Paris.

The alarming final approach to Gosol had to be undertaken on mules, which picked their way up precarious mountain tracks beside terrifying precipices. Upon arriving, Picasso and Olivier took a room on the first floor of the village’s only inn, the Hostal cal Tampanada. The plan was to while away the summer painting and enjoying the pleasures of a simple life.

In self-imposed exile from the backbiting Parisian art world, Picasso changed his art dramatically

Art historians ascribe special importance to Picasso’s time in Gosol, because there, in self-imposed exile from the backbiting Parisian art world, he changed his art dramatically and profoundly.

By 1906, Picasso had already enjoyed a taste of success in Paris, the epicentre of the avant-garde at that time. His 1901 debut Paris exhibition at the gallery of the dealer Ambroise Vollard had received positive reviews. Moreover, in the American collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein, he had found two important champions. But his melancholic and sentimental Blue and Rose period paintings, as brilliant as they were, were still indebted to 19th-Century art movements such as Symbolism.

Wikipedia Picasso persuaded his mistress, Fernande Olivier, who featured in many of his paintings including les Demoiselles d’Avignon, to go with him (Credit: Wikipedia)

When he arrived in Gosol, though, Picasso’s art was moving in a new, startling, and more original direction. It was beginning to feel tougher and simpler, stranger yet more timeless. Picasso sensed this change, and revelled in the rapture of inspiration. During his stay in Gosol, which lasted around 10 weeks, he was remarkably prolific: according to his biographer, John Richardson, he produced seven large paintings, a dozen medium-sized ones, and countless drawings, watercolours, gouaches, and carvings.

Skulls and smugglers

What was the catalyst for this transformation and excitement? There are several possibilities. Many of Picasso’s Gosol works feature Olivier, for instance, suggesting that the 24-year-old artist’s feelings for his lover were then especially intense.

Wikipedia Picasso’s Blue and Rose period paintings were still indebted to 19th Century Symbolism (Credit: Wikipedia)

There was also his new friendship with Gosol’s wily nonagenarian innkeeper, Josep Fondevila, a former smuggler with a shaved head and brilliant white teeth whom Picasso greatly admired. Certainly, Fontdevila’s severe, ascetic appearance began to infiltrate Picasso’s art, and it remained a touchstone until his death (witness the late skull-like self-portrait that the artist drew in 1972).

But Picasso also encountered something else in Gosol that altered his approach to painting: a 12th-Century polychrome wooden Madonna, with a strong, expressive white face with big, painted eyes, which he saw in the village church.

Today, this 77cm-high (30in) sculpture, which is considered a fine example of Catalan Romanesque art, is part of the collection of Barcelona’s Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC). It currently plays a starring role in MNAC’s Romanesque Picasso, a show featuring around 40 artworks by the Spanish Modernist. This exhibition suggests “affinities” between Picasso’s work and the holdings of medieval Romanesque art, mostly from churches in the Pyrenees built during the 11th to 13th centuries, for which MNAC is internationally renowned. One glance at the Gosol Madonna, for instance, reveals that it was a source for Picasso’s painting Woman with Loaves (1906).

The thing is, while art historians are aware that Picasso was looking with interest at Romanesque art in the years leading up to his invention of Cubism, they tend to overlook its impact upon his development, preferring instead to concentrate on better-known influences such as African tribal art, archaic Iberian sculpture, and Cezanne.

“While Picasso’s ‘primitivism’ has always been known,” says MNAC’s director Pepe Serra, “what is clear upon seeing the show is that Romanesque art was also one of the most important sources for him. The exhibition demonstrates that there is a very strong connection between Picasso and Romanesque art.”

‘Creative lifeblood’

It is likely that Picasso first started looking seriously at Romanesque art four years prior to his trip to Gosol, when a major exhibition of Romanesque and Gothic art opened in Barcelona, coinciding with a resurgence in Catalan nationalism. A little over three decades later, in 1934, by which time Picasso was an international celebrity living permanently in France, the artist returned to Barcelona to visit the new National Museum (then known as the Art Museum of Catalonia), shortly before its official inauguration.

A newspaper covered the event, which proved to be Picasso’s last visit to his homeland – after the rise of Franco, he never returned to Spain. “Passing from one room to another,” the reporter wrote, “Picasso, before those incomparable fragments of early Catalan art, admired [their] power, intensity and skill … and he stated without hesitation that our Romanesque Museum will be something unique in the world, an indispensable resource for anyone who wishes to know the origins of Western art, an invaluable lesson for the moderns.”

When asked how much Romanesque art meant to him, Miró used to tap the veins in his forearm

Throughout his life, as MNAC’s exhibition reveals, Picasso amassed many books, postcards and photographs documenting Romanesque art, attesting to his enduring interest in the subject. In this, he was not alone. Joan Miró, for instance, another great modern Spanish artist, was also compelled by Romanesque art, which he studied as a boy growing up in Barcelona. When asked how much it meant to him, Miró used to tap the veins in his forearm. It was in his creative lifeblood.

What, then, was the “invaluable lesson” that Romanesque art taught both Picasso and Miró? According to MNAC’s director, Picasso was drawn to the “simplicity” of Catalan Romanesque art: “It’s a naive, very ‘primitive’ art,” Serra explains. “For example, perspective is not used, and it is extremely schematic in the composition of the faces, which appealed to Picasso. It is also full of symbols – eyes, fires, fish – that represent other things.”

“And there is another big link with Picasso in terms of the subjects: the violence, the dismembered bodies, the skulls, crucifixions, the presence of death. So, there are thematic links as well as stylistic ones.”

Elizabeth Cowling, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Edinburgh and curator of Picasso Portraits, an ongoing exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London, agrees: the aspects of Romanesque art that most appealed to Picasso, she says, were “the stylisation, the intensity and forcefulness, the fact that it wasn’t driven by a naturalist aesthetic”.

RMN-Grand Palais Picasso’s wider interest in primitive art helps to explain his fascination with the Romanesque (Credit: RMN-Grand Palais)

Like Serra, she believes that Picasso’s stay in Gosol in 1906 was “very important”, because it was “the break that gave him the opportunity to absorb sources he’d recently discovered more fully and develop ideas and themes outside the competitive environment of a major city. And being such a backwater – so unmodernised – it must have reinforced his well-established penchant for the primitive.”

Indeed, Picasso’s wider interest in primitivism helps to explain his fascination with Romanesque art. “Primitivism is a huge subject,” says Cowling. “But, very broadly, primitivists had a sense that the ‘primitive’ was more authentic and purer than sophisticated Western art of the Renaissance and post-Renaissance periods. There’s a strong element of anti-naturalism at its core, and also anti-academicism – so anything that was considered ‘canonical’ at the time was liable to be rejected by primitivists.”

In other words, the Romanesque offered Picasso a revelatory model as he battled to dismantle and reassemble the great tradition of Western art. As Cowling puts it: “Picasso was never passive when it came to sources of inspiration – he got excited by new discoveries, but I think he was attracted to a new source because it chimed with something that already interested him, that meant something for his current work.”

17 August 2018 Share Save Devon Van Houten Maldonado Features correspondent Share Save

Museo Nacional de Arte de Mexico

The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.

In 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn’t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.

During colonisation Maya blue was exploited along with everything else that had belonged to the people of the New World

Across the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like José Juárez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Cristóbal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico – New Spain – were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited. - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder - The world’s most mysterious silver cups

The ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi – the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years – is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.

Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chichén Itzá (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calderón, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.

Archaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The añil plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn’t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue’s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the añil plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.

Rhapsody in blue

Master painters from the Americas are discussed in art history – if they’re mentioned at all – as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Juárez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico’s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Juárez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale – and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette.

Devon Van Houten Maldonado Villalpondo painted this cúpula of the major altar at the cathedral in Puebla, Mexico in 1688 – the blues are just as vibrant today (Credit: Devon Van Houten Maldonado)

While Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Juárez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens’, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue – if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Juárez’s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Juárez died in poverty. If Juárez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?

On the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' ‘fear of space’ – the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident – thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result – the same as his peers in Mexico – was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.

Baltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as ‘El Echave de los azules’ (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.

The lack of written evidence of the use of añil or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren’t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from añil by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chichén Itzá. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.

This cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.

Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.

Beware of green. It can’t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment’s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, “vanishes into thin air”. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso’s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.

More like this:

To dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green’s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour – one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.

Donning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. “Like the vampire,” the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, “she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave”. Describing Leonardo’s inscrutable sitter as “older than the rocks among which she sits”, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from “a diver in deep seas” to a savvy operator who has woven “strange webs with Eastern merchants”. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant’s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was “the mother of Helen of Troy” and the “mother Mary”.

Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris – who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next

Long before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris – ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh’s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.

Perennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt’s kings the path to resurrection.

Flora and fauna

For millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the ‘The Asp of Jerusalem’. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.

An acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he’d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe’s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.

If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking a curious compression of life and death, it’s green

Fertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini’s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy’s bump in Jan van Eyck’s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn’t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.

An alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green’s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck’s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao – his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple’s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it’s green.

So green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable’s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting – a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.

Though rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour’s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one’s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.

Hiding in plain sight

In more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin’s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour’s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue – as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.

Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte’s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist’s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,” Magritte observed to an interviewer. “There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.”

No contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully’s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse’s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse’s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully’s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer’s space, the ficus greens of Scully’s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.

19 April 2018 Share Save Kelly Grovier Features correspondent Share Save

A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction.

Pink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word “pink” attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant – to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. “He pink’d his Dubblet”, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by “Beggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains”, describing a lethal lunge through a man’s padded jacket, “He run him through”.

More like this:

At what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of “pink” to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly.

Remove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas’s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso’s pivotal pink period wouldn’t rise to the occasion.

A flesh in the pan

A key moment in pink’s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico’s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer’s spirit is summoned to levitate.

Crucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel – who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary’s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what’s most surprising about Gabriel’s depiction is Fra Angelico’s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink.

Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh

We know from a contemporary artist’s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni’s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. “Made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John’s white”, Cennini explains, “this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls”.

By draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries.

Bloom of Christ

As the focus of Renaissance master Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition, dianthus (the Greek name for the plant, meaning “flower of God”), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son’s crucifixion.

The flower’s anachronistic appearance in Raphael’s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe.

Pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue

Over time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue.

Famous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become.

La Tour’s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself – music, astronomy, and literature.

Porcelain pink

A patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime – an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour.

No painting embodies pink’s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour’s and Romney’s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We’re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now.

In more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s.

By then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls’ dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops.

At the same moment that Guston’s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss’s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as “Baker-Miller Pink”, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates’ cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges.

Yet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor’s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red.

Emboldened by Kapoor’s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the “pinkest pink” ever contemplated (“no one has ever seen a pinker pink”, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him. En garde, Kapoor. You’ve been pink’d.

For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher’s Stone – and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.

Expunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch’s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton’s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh’s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It’s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being – this world and another, life and death.

Outside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming into a spectrum of shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange), quickly embraced the linguistic coincidence in the 1570s. His orange-white-and-blue rebel flag would become the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion of everything from Swiss fire engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it’s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.

Convinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance

From antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth’s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.

Convinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning ‘gold’, and pigmentum meaning ‘colour’) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.

A spark to a flame

Intentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet’s plush orange jacket – its vibrant rumples flickering like flares – threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer’s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work’s flustering power would be utterly lost.

Nor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard’s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don’t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange – not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.

Munch and Matisse set the tone for the portentous temperament of orange in modern art

And so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we’ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch’s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse’s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?

Commissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch’s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other’s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse’s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.

Amber alert

Munch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte’s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: “You know I don’t like orange”. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together – while threatening to break apart – the visual music of her sinuous mosaics.

As crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City’s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways – each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life – birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity – could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.

Marcel Duchamp’s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart – and at its 17th-Century predecessor.

This year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history – a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.

More like this:

The work in question is awkwardly proportioned – over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall – and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um’, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m’ennuies, or ‘you bore me’) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making – found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel – that he christened ‘readymades’.

In stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, “Duchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.” Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.

Anyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these ‘readymade’ swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.

A pigment of our imagination

In a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp’s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp’s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.

Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity – a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt

The years and decades that followed Duchamp’s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept – a pigment of their imagination.

At the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity – a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.

Titians of industry

Suddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard – one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues – a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades – a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.

The sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp’s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.

The 800-page volume from 1692 is an obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint

Long forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of ‘A. Boogert’ – a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.

Boogert’s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Bibliothèque Méjanes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel’s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author’s own lifetime.

To click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp’s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert’s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp’s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life’s most elusive dimension: colour.

Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status.

Although scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world’s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World’s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe. An exhibition at Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes museum reveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism.

In medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and – in turn – wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive.

The Turkey red process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood

For many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the ‘Turkey red’ process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book, A Perfect Red.

Dyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John’s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices.

Mesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine.

Cochineal in the New World

When the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. “Scarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,” Sanchez told the BBC.

King Charles V of Spain saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers

Cortés immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. “I shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,” wrote Cortés to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was “twice as large as that of Salamanca,"" he wrote, “They also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.”

First-hand accounts indicate that Cortés wasn’t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cortés about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler.

“Through absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,” says Sanchez. “They obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.” The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren’t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar – while the Spaniards “profited enormously as intermediaries.”

Red in art history

Dye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John’s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe – growing from a meagre “50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,” writes Butler.

In the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Cristóbal de Villalpando and Luis Juárez, father of José Juárez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebastián López de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens.

López de Arteaga’s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio’s version of the same work, where St Thomas’s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in López de Arteaga’s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style.

A few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens’ unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you.

Moving forward toward modernism – it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world – impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir’s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red.

After synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring – its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back – the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. “In Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,” Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico “the colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.”

Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point.

When it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Miloš Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart.

But in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardian declared that ""the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is"", and the BBC commented that ""the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact"". Salieri, critics noted, was no pious bachelor (as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actually commonplace in middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in an unmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, the complaint goes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note.

But this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984.

Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him – Paul Frazier

The film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development.

Jump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh – he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity.

The premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to ""demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film"". Across four irascible months cloistered in a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh palette of political resonances.

The casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaled Gone with the Wind in scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literally thousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamill endured grueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: ""No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart."" Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus.

The triumph of genius

The Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a ""traitor"" to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US.

Nearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag and Nurse Ratched as the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted the founder of Hustler magazine squaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet.

The Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR – a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius.

In Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother – a pious Italian woman – saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: ""I told her, 'mum, that was an extra – somebody else threw it in there!'"")

And then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices – the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder. Grim excavations of these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery.

Jeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. ""The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera – 'too many notes' – is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression.""

Amadeus behind the Iron Curtain

Shooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so a deal was struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son.

Forman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. ""As it had to be in the socialist Prague,"" he wrote, ""the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production"".

Perhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Jiří Purš, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: ""I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on?"" Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: ""Look, it's about Mozart!""

F Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague.

Abraham tells the BBC, ""At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance.""

That tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled ""action"" a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them.

Forman recalled, ""All stood up – except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras.""

As Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: ""Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn.""

Historian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. ""Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer's Oppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement.""

Not everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics.

""That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music,"" Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances.

""The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning,"" he says. ""All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Miloš Forman.""

For his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. ""Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates.""

19 February 2024 Share Save Nafeesah Allen Features correspondent Share Save

From a 17th-Century Italian violin stolen from Japan to Drake's lost Blackberry in Mexico, here are musical lost and found mysteries that rival Sir Paul McCartney's.

In musical happy endings, last week, Sir Paul McCartney was reunited with his bass guitar that was stolen 51 years ago in London. The instrument, which McCartney purchased in 1961, was subsequently nabbed from a band van in 1972. Now, thanks to the Lost Bass search project, the Beatle has been reunited with the bass, which had been until recently stashed in a Sussex attic. Both McCartney and Höfner, the instrument manufacturer, authenticated the found item upon its rediscovery, and a spokesperson for McCartney told BBC News he was ""incredibly grateful"" for the return of his lost guitar.

More like this:

But McCartney certainly isn't the only musician to lose a valuable piece of his kit – in fact, he's not even the only Beatle. And for non-Beatles-level musical acts, the loss of an instrument – or worse, an entire kit – can be devastating. The BBC previously reported on the theft of rock band Cemetery Sun's entire kit and van, as well as trio Noisy's stolen kit reappearing with individual instruments and pieces of gear up for auction online weeks later.

Bassist Grant Emerson of Americana band Delta Rae recalls having around $10,000 (£7,937) of musical instruments stolen: ""We played at the Bitter End in New York City and parked our van down the street. When we came back to the van, the back door had been broken into, and all of our guitars were gone, plus a pedal board and a piece of the drummer's equipment. Probably four to five pieces of gear were stolen. It was a really terrible drive back to North Carolina."" He notes that for most bands, the only recourse is fundraising: ""You just rely on your fans. You ask for help and donations, which isn't easy."" And he urges all musicians to ""photograph the serial number of every instrument and piece of gear you own"".

Lost or stolen instruments over the years have kept musicians and fans alike searching for guitars, violins, and even an entire brass band. Here are a few more musical mysteries – some of which remain unsolved to this day.

BB King

The famous blues legend was known for riffs on his legendary guitar, a Gibson he named Lucille – in fact, King had multiple performance guitars named Lucille over the course of his career. The name was inspired by a lover’s quarrel King witnessed in 1949 (the woman arguing was named Lucille, and she left quite an impression on King). When this particular Lucille guitar was stolen, it was eventually found in a Las Vegas pawn shop by Eric Dahl, a fellow musician who mistakenly purchased the guitar and later returned it to King. Dahl offered it without compensation and went on to write a book about King and his many guitars. The Gibson also ended up being one of the last instruments King played before his death in 2015, and it was subsequently sold at his estate auction for $280,000 (£222,286) in 2019.

Eric Clapton

Clapton's Gibson Les Paul guitar, named Beano, was stolen soon after his studio album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in 1966. Unlike King, Clapton hasn't been so lucky as to be reunited with his lost guitar – yet. But singer-songwriter Joe Bonamassa has claimed he knows where it is: In 2016, Bonamassa gave an interview in which he said the guitar was in a private US collection, which spurred a 2018 petition to encourage Bonamassa to reveal more details. On their YouTube channel, music aficionados Baxter and Jonathan of North Carolina-based Casino Guitars joked that they imagine a ""guitar illuminati"" trading in lost and rare instruments might not be pleased with what Bonamassa has already shared so far – and pondered whether he has a responsibility to help Clapton retrieve the stolen item if he does, in fact, know where it is.

Takiko Omura

A violin made in 1675 by Nicolo Amati in Italy was stolen in 2005 from the home of Japanese violinist Takiko Omura, who had purchased the instrument in the United States many decades earlier. The violin, which was priced at nearly £300,000 ($377,895) in 2005 when it was taken, was reportedly found in 2020 in Parma, Italy, in the raid of a home of a suspected drug trafficker. Authorities in Italy and Japan worked together to return the instrument to its rightful owner.

Stooges Brass Brand

It's difficult enough to find one lost guitar, let alone an entire brass band. In 2022, a famous local New Orleans ""second line"" brass band had all their equipment stolen from their van during the worst possible time for them – two weeks before New Orleans Jazz Fest. Nearly $12,000 (£9,526) in musical instruments, including cymbals, drum sets, keyboards and amps, were stolen when the band's van disappeared from outside the home of a band member. The theft threatened to derail the Stooges' festival appearance that year, but the band is back on its feet, with a scheduled appearance on 28 April at this year's Jazz Fest.

Min Kym

As the BBC has previously reported, the violin prodigy Min Kym's Stradivarius was stolen in 2010 from a Pret a Manger restaurant. This was no ordinary violinist and no ordinary violin: At just seven years old, Kym had earned a slot at the prestigious Purcell School of Music in the UK, and at age 11, she won first prize at the Premier Mozart International Competition. When presented with the opportunity to own a rare 1696 Stradivarius, ""Kym remortgaged her flat and bought the violin for £450,000 ($580,000). If this seems like an astronomical amount of money, it was in fact a steal in Stradivarius terms: the violin's actual worth was closer to £1.2m ($1.5m) and these instruments are so precious that their value only ever goes up,” reads the 2017 article about the crime. Although the stolen violin was eventually recovered three years later, it was not returned to Kym, and her memoir, Gone: A Girl, A Violin, A Life Unstrung, tells the story of coping with a musical instrument being lost and found and then lost again.

George Harrison

Sir Paul wasn't even the only Beatle whose beloved instrument was absconded with: George Harrison's 1965 Rickenbacker guitar was allegedly stolen in 1966. Rickenbacker CEO John Hall told Reverb that the guitar's mystery has been so longstanding because ""no one knows the exact serial number of the original guitar."" The Rickenbacker team were, however, able to narrow the list down to five potential guitars based on shipment dates.

Harrison also had his '57 Les Paul, Lucy – which was formerly owned by the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, and Eric Clapton – stolen. It was nabbed from Harrison's home during a burglary in 1973 and then sold to a Los Angeles music store who, in turn, sold it to Mexican musician Miguel Ochoa, who declined to sell it back to Harrison at full price. Instead, Ochoa negotiated a trade with Harrison: Harrison got Lucy back, and Ochoa would get a 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Fender Precision bass.

Drake

In his 2009 song Say What's Real, produced by Kanye West, Drake revealed that he lost some of his best lyrics in Mexico: ""Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo/So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll,"" he raps, followed by an expletive-laden line that finishes the rhyme. For his genre of music, that Blackberry was his instrument, which he used to pen his songs. While it doesn't sound like it's ever been returned, Drake has probably upgraded his tech.

Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.

A night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.

More like this:

This is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera House cut ties with its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to a UK study conducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work – and opera houses are no exception.

The pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive the Theatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes – sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations – spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.

Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne – Phil Boot

A key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. ""Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,"" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentary Take Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne.

The power of Glyndebourne

In 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: ""I know that many opera companies… don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.""

Glyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the global Race to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. ""We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,"" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. ""We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine."" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. ""Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,"" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. ""This way everything goes back into the ground.""

Climate action

Glyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Opéra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.

The rooftop of the Opéra Bastille, for example, is host to an urban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.

The Sydney Opera House has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity

The Sydney Opera House – a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 – has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021, a survey by the UK's Theatres Trust found that it would cost more than £1bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.

In the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than 630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recent New York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.

Elsewhere, the Opéra de Lyon, Göteborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on a new project investigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first ""green season"", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new ""eco-entertainment"" work titled Masque of Might.

As the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.

31 July 2023 Share Save Beverley D'Silva Features correspondent Share Save

Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone.

Conductor Sir Antonio Pappano is renowned for being a warm-hearted ""people person"". But there's one thing that makes his blood run cold: when he hears opera being accused of being an art form that's only for a wealthy elite. ""I get very offended by people who say we're elitist,"" he says passionately in a new documentary. This is ""a misconception that totally distorts the image of opera,"" he adds. ""The fact of the matter is, it's harder to get into a football game in London than it is to get into the [Royal] Opera House.""

More like this:

This allusion to the beautiful game is not a frivolous one. When Pappano became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in 2002, he spoke of his love for popular music by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Joni Mitchell, and for musicals. ""I like football too,"" he added. ""Does that mean you can't like opera?""

Back then Pappano was 42, and the youngest conductor to lead ROH's orchestra. Some 700 operas later – with many productions of the French and Italian repertoires; a good part of the Russian; Wagner, Strauss and contemporary works – and he is the subject of A Time of Change, presented by Zeinab Badawi, and part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera.

The documentary follows him from his modest roots, as the son of Italian immigrant parents who came from southern Italy to the UK, who worked hard to make ends meet. They passed on their strong work ethic to him, and he learnt how to work with singers from his vocal coach father, flourishing as a musical talent in the ""the family business"". A Time of Change goes on to trace a career that includes assisting classical pianist Daniel Barenboim, through to a recent high, conducting the King's coronation service in May, featuring solos by Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel and South African soprano Pretty Yende.

Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience – it must be open to the interests of many different people – Antonio Pappano

The main focus of the film, though, is Pappano's mission to open up opera to everyone. ""Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience, or be focused on just one corner of the repertoire,"" he says. ""It must be open to the interests of many different people."" While he asserts that the ROH, like every big opera house, wants to entice young audiences, he does concede: ""I think you have to be honest and say, yes, but younger people can't afford very expensive tickets, can they?""

It's true that the price of opera tickets can seem too high to be anything but a rare luxury for most, especially young people. Halley Bondy, writing on the arts website Paste Magazine, describes herself as someone who has been to the opera many times ""for a millennial"". And although she loves opera – ""from the hyper-real grandness to the unbelievable talent, to the septuagenarian, fur-hatted audience"" – she finds it ""easy to see why places like The Met [Metropolitan Opera House in NYC] are ailing in sales; young people just don't go. It's too expensive, too arcane, too massive… The onus is on the opera houses to do a better job of catering to the young.""

Bondy has only managed to attend so often by being treated by a ""ridiculously generous friend"" or chasing discounted tickets. ""Like everything else in the world, the opera is a lot of fun if you have gobs of money,"" she observes, but she concedes anyone could get in with the $25 [£19.40] rush tickets, student tickets or commercial offers – which make it ""affordable, if you just dig a little"".

In opera's defence, ticket prices are generally high because it is notoriously costly to produce. All the more reason, argued The Guardian's Charlotte Higgins in February, for adequate government funding. Discussing recent cuts to opera funding, she wrote: ""If you starve something, run it down constantly, gradually reduce the provision of it so that few can afford it, it becomes 'elitist'… And if opera in the form that its creators imagine it becomes for toffs, that is nothing to do with opera itself… [it is] precisely the result of neglect and underfunding"".

Pappano is also invested in bringing new blood to opera, via schemes like the ROH's schools matinees, which offer young people low-cost tickets to opera productions. Also, its Youth Opera talent development programme gives children aged seven to 13 the chance to try its ""rigorous music and drama training"".

""We make sure there's a real variety of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities, and an even gender split,” says Tom Floyd, ROH senior opera manger, talking about its open recruitment system. Most of the young people who join them ""come from families who probably have had no real experience of opera,"" he says.

Opera for all

Over at English National Opera (ENO), the company has stayed true to its egalitarian roots of the late 19th-Century, when theatrical producer Lilian Baylis and music director Charles Corri shared a vision of it as a place for ""people's opera"". ENO has ""opera for all"" in its mission statement. It does not assume knowledge of opera; its website has key figures of the organisation explaining what opera is and how it's made; and the site hints at how it skillfully reimagines crowd pleasers, like La Traviata (to be performed this October), in thrilling new ways, alongside daring new work, such as 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, by performance artist Marina Abramovich (November).

""We sing in English to be accessible to the widest possible audience,"" an ENO spokesperson tells BBC Culture. The company offers free tickets for under-21s; discounts for under 35s, and tickets from £10 for all. No surprise, then, that more than half its bookings last season were from opera first-timers.

Still, in order to survive the cuts to Arts Council England (ACE) funding, the ENO will next year move its main base from the London Coliseum to outside the capital and in so doing will qualify for £24m funding over three years.

A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks, in pubs, opera on your tablet – Darren Henley

Opera must change, ACE chief executive Darren Henley wrote in an article for The Guardian: ""A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks… in pubs, opera on your tablet"". In truth, most opera companies are not digital-age dodgers; they have presences on the popular digital platforms, while the hashtag #operaisopen invites new audiences to click through.

Streaming services – like Royal Opera Stream and Glyndebourne Encore – have dished up productions and events, both popular and esoteric, to reach a wider audience. And there's also opera at the cinema. At ROH, 2022/23 has been its biggest cinema season ever, with more than 1,300 cinemas worldwide having shown or showing 13 productions (opera and ballet), including Madam Butterfly, La Boheme and Aida. The latter, staged in May and June 2023, was conducted by Pappano.

Nurturing promising young talent – like soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha – is a passion of Pappano’s, and he's also a role model for young opera conductors, like Avishka Ederisinghe, who says that watching him talking on YouTube was what inspired him to explore the art form.

As he steps down from his music director roles – at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome after 18 years, and at ROH next summer, after 22 years – Pappano is looking forward to change. He will not be hanging up the baton yet: he will succeed Simon Rattle to become chief conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra, his ""dream job"".

He describes how he grew up in a council flat that was just ""a four-minute walk to Westminster Abbey""; and that rising from his humble background to conducting the coronation at that same abbey was ""not a bad gig"". Jokes aside, there is a message there that he'd love to hand down to a younger generation: ""If you have a vision for what you want to achieve in life, that spark and… the energy and resilience to keep pushing when you know things will get tough, you can make it in any walk of life.""

Opera star Bryn Terfel emerged from an extraordinary cultural heritage and a nation renowned for its love of singing. ""It's the air that we breathe,"" he explains in a new documentary.

Sir Bryn Terfel is pondering a question: what is it about Wales and the Welsh that produces a nation of singers? ""I think it's the mountains, and the fresh sea air. And the language – that is very important,"" he says. ""Then there's the hymns… You know, we just love to sing – it's the air that we breathe.""

More like this:

The Welsh bass-baritone is the subject of Peak Performance, part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera. Presented by Zeinab Badawi, it follows Sir Bryn – as he has been known since his knighthood in 2017 – from his operatic debut with the Welsh National Opera in 1990, to singing at opera houses across the world, like London's Royal Opera House, where he is a regular star performer. En route, the documentary revisits his roots in rural Wales and looks at how he's nurturing the next generations of singing talent, as well as his invitation to sing at King Charles's coronation.

Sir Bryn is high on the list of great living Welsh opera singers, which also includes luminaries such as Dame Gwyneth Jones, Wynne Evans, Katherine Jenkins, and Aled Jones. (Added to which there are many popular non-opera Welsh singers, including Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Bonnie Tyler, Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews.) But beyond these headline stars lies a whole nation renowned for its love of singing, especially choral. So where does this passion for song stem from?

In A History of Music and Singing in Wales, novelist and poet Wyn Griffith, who wrote extensively on Wales and Welsh culture, observed: ""If you find a score of Welsh people, in Wales or out of it, you will find a choir. They sing for their own delight, and they always sing in harmony. They sing as naturally and easily as they talk.""

""Wales is known as a nation of music – the 'land of song',"" notes the Welsh National Opera (WNO). ""Often connected with male voice choirs, it is… recognised for its choral traditions which are rooted in the culture.""

Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels – there is no pomp…. It unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots – Mike Williams

Choral singing in Wales dates back to the 19th Century, and flourished with the Cymanafa Ganu (hymn singing) movement, at a chapel in Aberdare in 1859; it was rooted mainly in religious songs, though a steady body of secular songs were also produced. Soon after, a revival of traditional Welsh music began with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, a focus for the Welsh passion for singing and song. Any worthy list of classic Welsh songs might include Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (O Land of My Fathers); My Little Welsh Home by William Sidney Gwynn Williams; and the love song Ar Lan y Mor (recorded by both Terfel and Jenkins). Or the rousing We'll Keep a Welcome (In the Hillsides).

The male voice choir, along with the harp, are two of the most popular signifiers of Welsh music. Professor Gareth Williams traces the male voice choir's origins to the mid-19th Century industrial age: ""We are reminded of what Aneurin Bevan once said: 'Culture comes off the end of a pick',"" he writes, referring to Welsh coal miners. Choirs started in the 1920s, like Cwbach from the Cynon Valley, and Pendyrus, survive today. After a day's hard graft in a mine, says Williams, the joy and community found in singing with co-workers was ""an assertion of working-class male bonding and identity expressed through that most democratic and inexpensive instrument, the human voice"".

The Welsh Borough Chapel in Southwark, London, is host to Eschoir, a Welsh male choir of around 20 singers, aged 20 to 75. Singing together since 2009, they've performed at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Eschoir founder and director Mike Williams, who grew up in south Wales, describes their appeal: ""There's a humility to it, as Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels. Many people enjoy singing in the pub as much as singing in a concert. There is no pomp… it unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots."" And the Welsh take choirs very seriously, he adds.

In tandem with a passion for choral singing in Wales, there has been a rise in popularity of the Eisteddfod. These Welsh singing and recital competitions date back to the 12th Century and today are a platform for public singing, especially for younger singers. It was at local Eisteddfods that the young Bryn Terfel first stood out, winning singing competitions that would lead him to study at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and to his first professional role in Cosi Fan Tutti at Welsh National Opera, soon after graduating in 1989.

A unique cultural inheritance

In the documentary, Terfel recalls competing in Eisteddfods in his rural north Wales, and how his ""parents paid for a lot of petrol to drive me north, south, east and west to compete. They saw something in their son… the passion, how I loved singing. I think that drove them to encourage the singing within me."" Eisteddfods are ""a wonderful shop window"", he says. One of his charitable initiatives is a scholarship to develop promising young performers coming up through Eisteddfods. Peak Performance visits one in Llanadog, near Swansea, as young singers of all genders, from the area and across Wales, prepare to get on stage and sing. ""This is where it all starts for us Welsh singers,"" says one teenage boy in the documentary. ""This is where we learn our craft."" He believes when Welsh singers go to London to study, ""you can see the difference… they’ve got some sort of… confidence.""

My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing – there was constant learning going on in the kitchen – Bryn Terfel

Certainly, Terfel was swaddled in song and music from the cradle. Born in 1967 in rural north Wales, his father was a farmer, his mother a special needs teacher who used music therapy in her work. The whole family, including older relatives, sang together and in choirs. ""My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing,"" he says. ""There was constant learning going on in the kitchen, words on the cabinets. A little bit of rivalry as well, which is quite healthy.""

Eilir Owen Griffiths, a composer and Eisteddfod adjudicator, explains what he looks for in a great singer: ""It's how the voice resonates, and the way it works with text."" He describes Terfil's voice as ""like a beautiful double bass"" – but it's not just the incredible sound he generates: ""It's also the control he has – he can sing the most delicate pianissimo as well. It's a unique voice, very special."" That quality – and cultural diversity – was drawn on when Sir Bryn sang at the coronation of King Charles, who personally chose him to perform; he sang Coronation Kyrie, a first in the Welsh language at a coronation. ""You have the rehearsals in the rooms… Then you have your fittings, and all of a sudden you're in your costume and make-up."" And you're onstage, he says, ""portraying a character. And that's when the fun really does begin!""

The documentary joins Terfel as he goes through his repertoire for a week in March: as well as the Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera House, he sings the title role in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; then travels to a studio near Cardiff in Wales, to record an album of sea shanties – the likes of Drunken Sailor, and traditional folk songs like Fflat Huw Puw, ""about a sailor and his wonderful ship"".

It's a voice that continues to thrill audiences, whether in lead roles such as Mozart’s Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera House; or Tosca by Puccini at Paris Opera Bastille; or Verdi's Falstaff, at Grange Park Opera, Surrey. As well as big opera houses, he performs for new audiences in concert halls too. Gillian Moore is artistic director of the South Bank Centre, where in recent months he sang extracts from two of Wagner's great roles: ""The fact he's passing that on to young singers makes total sense… When he's on stage, you cannot take your eyes off him.""

Returning to that question of why the Welsh love to sing, Wyn Griffith suggests it's about an irrepressible spirit – and it's simply in the blood: ""Whether they meet in tens or in thousands, in a small country chapel or in a vast assembly… they sing freely… It is not necessary to organise singing in Wales: it happens on its own.""

A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music – with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.

If asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yet a survey published in December 2022 by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO's broader finding that under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.

More like this:

There are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and – just as vitally – new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.

Unsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag ""classictok"" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.

For French violinist Esther Abrami – who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards – the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. ""I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,"" Abrami tells BBC Culture.

She noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. ""I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,"" she enthuses. ""It opened this door to a completely new world.""

I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot – Babatunde Akinboboye

Nigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fan Babatunde Akinboboye enjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. ""I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,"" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. ""But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,"" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of ""hip-hopera"" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.

Both Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. ""I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,"" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts – taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery – have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. ""It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,"" he explains. ""Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.""

'Complex and profound'

Abrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: ""I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.""

People who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music – Harriet Stubbs

British concert pianist Harriet Stubbs is another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple 20-minute concerts from her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. ""I gave 250 concerts,"" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. ""I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.""

The fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. ""I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,"" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a ""Bowie meets Rachmaninoff"" affair.

Interestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia – dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery – both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński, meanwhile, uses atmospheric visuals as a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, which The New York Times describes as ""resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos"".

""I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums – the narrative, the photography, the videos,"" Orliński tells BBC Culture. ""I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,"" he adds. This is certainly something Orliński has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, he wowed critics with his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was ""an incredible experience"" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. ""Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul – a pop song won't work.""

Classical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK's National Youth Orchestra have just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of ""the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager"".

Michael Sharkey Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński wowed critics with his performance as Didymus in Handel's Theodora, which included a pole-dance (Credit: Michael Sharkey)

Orliński agrees that classical music has achieved an ""almost hipstery"" status of late. ""It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,"" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as ""people like Yuja Wang"" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. ""We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward."" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. ""I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,"" he concludes. ""[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.""

Josh Parry / BBC

Frankie O'Reilly was nine-years-old when he met his future partner Georgie Long at primary school in Northern Ireland. The pair moved to London at the start of the 1980s, where Frankie worked as a traffic warden by day and a drag queen by night. By that time the two had long been inseparable - first as childhood best friends, and then as partners. In 1985, both aged 25, Frankie and Georgie were diagnosed with HIV. ""I started seeing friends slowly dying,"" Frankie says. ""It was like being at a bus stop with your friends and they start getting on buses, and then you're the last person at the stop."" In 1992, Georgie died of an Aids-related illness. Now, Georgie and hundreds like him are being remembered as part of the UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a patchwork creation of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 people who lost their lives to HIV/Aids in the UK, made by the people who loved them. The huge quilt will be on display in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in London between 12 and 16 June. Although different parts of it have been on display before, the showing at the Tate will be the largest public display of the quilt in its entirety since it was created in 1994.

Frankie O'Reilly Georgie (left) and Frankie (middle) were best friends and moved from Northern Ireland to London together in the 1980s

It was a month after Georgie died that Frankie decided to take part in the memorial quilt project, which had been brought to the UK from America by Scottish activist Alistair Hulme, who had seen an early display of the American version of the quilt, which was created in 1985, in San Francisco. ""I had nursed Georgie at home while he was sick and the last three years had been just awful,"" Frankie says, adding that helping to create the quilt helped him through the worst of his grief. Now 65 and describing himself as the ""last man standing"" of his friendship group, he says the quilt is a ""reminder of the bravest and most beautiful people"" he knew.

Getty Images Parts of the quilt have been on display before, like here at St Paul's Cathedral in 2016

Cathy John and Grace McElwee also took part in creating the UK Aids memorial quilt in the 1990s by making a panel for friend Michael Trask, who died in 1993. ""We were both librarians and got on like a house on fire as soon as we met in 1985,"" Cathy says. Michael became ill five years later, but ""didn't want to talk about it"" at first. For a while Cathy says they ""didn't know what was wrong with him"", before eventually coming to terms with the fact that he had Aids.

She chose to take part in the project after Michael died as a way to ""create an enduring tribute to him"". It took Cathy and Grace around a month to complete the textile, which Cathy says was ""part of the healing process"".

Cathy John Cathy described Michael as having a ""wicked sense of humour and warm generosity""

The women chose to stitch on to their panel the houses of Camden, where Michael lived, and the tree of life, to represent the parks in London he was fond of. The quilt was last on show in Hyde Park in 1994, when Cathy worked as a volunteer on the display. The project has always been more than a display of activism for Cathy - she says the quilt has ""got the stitches of love in it"". She says she is excited to see the quilt on display at the Tate Modern as an ""outpouring of love and friendship and dedication"".

Cathy and her friend Grace created a quilt for Michael in the early 1990s

Author Charlie Porter initiated the exhibition after writing to the Tate's director in July 2024 asking them to display the quilt. ""The history of the quilt involves it being displayed in iconic locations,"" Porter tells the BBC, referencing how the US quilt was displayed for the first time on the National Mall in Washington DC, during the national march for lesbian and gay rights. He hopes the UK quilt being on display again will allow more people to see it, but also ""give people a chance to grieve"", after many were unable to do so properly at the time of their loved ones' deaths in the 80s and 90s due to the stigma attached to HIV. The 384 people commemorated on the quilt include notable figures such as novelist Bruce Chatwin and actors Denham Elliot and Ian Charleston.

LDRS Portrait of Mai by Sir Joshua Reynolds is on display in Cartwright Hall in Manningham

An 18th Century painting described as ""the finest portrait by one of Britain's greatest artists"" has gone on display in Bradford. Valued at £50m, Portrait of Mai by Sir Joshua Reynolds is on show at the city's Cartwright Hall, in Manningham. The painting, which depicts the first Polynesian to visit Britain, is touring the country for the first time since it was saved for the nation in 2023. The National Portrait Gallery said the artwork was the ""most significant acquisition ever made"" and would be shared between galleries in the UK and the US.

Mai was a native of Raiatea, an island now part of French Polynesia. He travelled to England as part of Captain James Cook's second voyage and was received by royalty and the intellectual elite between 1774 and 1776. After embarking on a grand tour of Britain, Mai became something of a celebrity and had his portrait painted in London. Mai returned to his homeland in 1777, where he died two years later.

ThirteenStructures The 17th Century barn has fallen into disrepair but will be turned into a repertory theatre venue

Four top British actors including Ralph Fiennes are supporting the creation of a new theatre to encourage young and emerging talent. Dame Joanna Lumley, Brian Cox and Zoe Wanamaker are also patrons of OVO theatre company's project to convert a 17th Century barn in St Albans, Hertfordshire. OVO, which has staged 100 productions, plans to turn the derelict building into ""a vibrant performance venue"" that will house a new theatre company. Lumley said: ""As someone who had no formal acting training, I wholly encourage positive projects like this that identify young, up-and-coming talent from all kinds of backgrounds.""

Cox, 79, who recently played Logan Roy in Succession, left school at the age of 14 to join Dundee Repertory Theatre. ""This was my first experience of live theatre – until then it was seen as a middle class pursuit. ""The decline of the repertory system has denied many young people from working class backgrounds the opportunity of a career in theatre,"" he said. He is supporting OVO's new initiative ""to widen the talent pool and increase the diversity of our industry"".

Lea Meienberg/Gemma Levine Ralph Fiennes is ""extremely proud"" and Joanna Lumley is ""thrilled"" to be involved in the theatre project

OVO plans to employ a core group of actors and production staff for a season at a time, to ""provide vital opportunities for early career performers, creatives and crew"" who might otherwise struggle to get established. The first company of actors is expected to join in summer 2026, by which time renovations should be complete. St Germain's Barn, which dates back to 1649, is located in Verulamium Park and is listed on Historic England's ""at risk"" register. OVO said the building had ""deep theatrical roots"" and would enable its mission ""of creating bold, imaginative and surprising new versions of classic plays and stories"".

Simon Knight Architects The theatre will also provide rehearsal facilities, a bar and restaurant.

Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes said: ""I know the importance of an exceptional grassroots training experience. ""There is a sense of wonder and anticipation that comes with mixing the old and the new. ""The preservation of the 17th Century barn together with the eager energy of budding new actors will be the beginning of something fabulous."" Zoe Wanamaker hopes to continue her father's legacy at the Globe Theatre, in supporting the arts through a connection with historic buildings. She said: ""I passionately believe in opportunity for all. Not only do new actors and creatives benefit from schemes like OVO's barn theatre, but the impact on society is huge too.""

Aberdeen Archives, Gallery & Museums Train Landscape was painted by Eric Ravilious in the 1940s and features the Westbury White Horse

A piece of art depicting the Wiltshire countryside through a train window has been voted as the public's favourite UK railway-themed artwork. Train Landscape was painted by Eric Ravilious in the 1940s, showing the Westbury White Horse through a third-class train carriage. His wife Tirzah Garwood made the collage section of the piece, using sections of different watercolours her husband had painted while travelling on trains. The artwork beat 19 others, including the works of JMW Turner and David Shepherd, in a global Railway 200 poll held to mark two centuries of the modern railway.

The winner was announced earlier, on the anniversary of the birth of the railway pioneer George Stephenson.

The National Gallery, London Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway, by JMW Turner, came second in the poll

Mr Ravilious' granddaughter Ella Ravilious said she was ""thrilled"" her grandfather's work had won. ""He was quite a picky artist,"" she said. ""He would tear up lots of his watercolours that he wasn't happy with."" She said it's ""fitting"" the piece is now marking 200 years of the railway because it is a composite picture of elements from several different railway lines. ""I'm thrilled that interest in Eric's work has sustained and that he is becoming even more popular,"" Ms Ravilious added.

National Railway Museum / Science & Society Picture Library David Shepherd's Service by Night finished third in the poll

Heritage Minister Baroness Twycross said the artwork was a worthy victor. ""This evocative watercolour invites us all to experience a railway journey through an artist's eye, capturing a uniquely British perspective that resonates today. ""Art offers us a powerful way to engage with our past and this selection of artworks tell the unique story of Britain's relationship with railways over 200 years."" The 20 most popular paintings are available to view on the Art UK website until the end of the year. ""I encourage everyone to explore these magnificent works and find inspiration from our shared cultural heritage,"" Baroness Twycross added.

Getty Images Food and restaurants played a surprisingly important role in the civil rights movement (Credit: Getty Images)

From a Memphis fried chicken joint to a tamale counter in Jackson, these restaurants didn't just feed civil rights leaders – they funded, sheltered and fuelled the fight for equality.

The unassuming brick-and-siding facade of Lannie's BBQ Spot in Selma, Alabama, belies the rich history within. Named one of the nation's best restaurants by USA Today, this family-run eatery has long been more than a place for charred ribs and tangy sauce. As BBC Travel show host Reece Parkinson discovered on a recent trip to mark the 60th anniversary of the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Lannie's also played a vital role in the civil rights movement.

""My mother and my grandmother fed a lot of people in the march,"" said Floyd Hatcher, who runs Lannie's today. His grandmother, Lannie Moore Travis, opened the restaurant in 1942 and made it one of Selma's first racially integrated dining spaces. During the 1965 Selma march for equal voting rights – which was met with extreme violence – Lannie's became a safe haven for protestors to gather.

""Barbecue brings people together,"" Hatcher added. ""Don't care what race you are.""

Today, restaurants like Lannie's are still bringing people together, serving up delicious dishes alongside a deeper understanding of the role these spaces played in the fight for justice. This year marks both the 60th anniversary of the Selma March and the 70th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where African Americans refused to ride the city's public transportation in protest of segregated seating laws. These historical milestones shine a light on the movement's famous activists as well as on the small, Black-owned businesses that helped make the fight for equality possible.

An unheard account of the historic 'Bloody Sunday' civil rights march in Selma in 1965.

""Food was always a crucial component of the civil rights movement,"" explained Bobby J Smith, associate professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and author of the book Food Power Politics: The Food Story of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement. ""Bringing food to the conversation really just expands the story that we already know. It also introduces new characters, new programmes [and] new actors. There [were many] unnamed women who were doing that kind of work.""

According to Smith, Black-owned restaurants, and even home cooks, were in many ways the bedrock of the movement, putting lives and livelihoods on the line for justice. They provided more than meals; they offered safe spaces to meet and strategise, gave moral support, and in some cases, covered travel and bail costs that were out of reach for many of the working-class activists. Whether through fundraisers, bake sales or out-of-pocket donations, Black business owners throughout the US South used their success and community status to do the quiet work of funding a revolution.

The anniversaries of these momentous events come as the US wrestles with the implications of sweeping funding cuts to institutions that support African American history. ""Whether it's in university spaces, in federal agencies [or] just in everyday lives, these kinds of stories are being erased or sidelined,"" Smith said. ""But food can be that space to recover [them].""

Though many of the businesses from the movement have closed, there are several restaurants across the South that were once important hubs for strategy, solidarity and community. Here are five you can still visit:

Dooky Chase in New Orleans, Louisiana

A New Orleans institution known for its classic Creole cooking, Dooky Chase was a hotspot for civil rights organisers, lawyers and freedom fighters in the 1950s and still offers classic New Orleans dishes like seafood gumbo to politicians and celebrities today. Not only were civil rights icons like Thurgood Marshall, Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial and Oretha Castle Haley all frequent patrons, but chef Leah Chase, sometimes called the ""Queen of Creole Cuisine"", transformed its dining room into a gallery space for the city's African American artists.

Brenda's Bar-B-Q Pit in Montgomery, Alabama

Originally opened in 1942 as the Siesta Club, Brenda's Bar-B-Q Pit has been a staple in Montgomery ever since. Brenda's back room was used as a safe haven during the Montgomery bus boycott, where organisers could meet and create leaflets to hand out in support of the movement. It was also where owner Jereline Bethune taught reading and writing classes to help African Americans pass the discriminatory literacy tests required to vote in elections. Today, the tiny, brick take-out joint still serves up some of the best barbecue in the city, though visitors should be sure to bring cash.

The Four Way Grill in Memphis, Tennessee

Located in the historic neighbourhood of Soulsville, near the legendary Stax recording studio (now the Stax Museum of American Soul), The Four Way is a classic soul food restaurant with long ties to the African American community. It hosted many of the city's civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr, who frequently dined here before his assassination in 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in downtown Memphis, now the National Civil Rights museum. Visitors can order a classic ""meat and three"", a main meat dish with three sides, while perusing photos of the icons who dined here.

Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia

Once referred to as the unofficial headquarters of the civil rights movement for the number of activists that visited, Paschal's has prepared Southern dishes, like their famous fried chicken, since 1947, first at the original location on West Hunter Street and now in the Castleberry Hill Arts District, where it moved in 2002. The Paschal brothers, who owned the restaurant, were key figures in the movement, often posting bond for protestors and serving complimentary meals to families reuniting with loved ones who had been detained or arrested by police for their involvement in protests.

Big Apple Inn in Jackson, Mississippi

Known for its pig ear sandwiches and Mississippi hot tamales, the original Big Apple Inn was a fixture on Farish Street, which was the centre of Black life in Jackson in the 1950s and '60s. In 1954, the space above the small family-owned takeaway spot served as the offices for the activist Medgar Evers, the Mississippi field secretary for the NAACP (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), a civil rights organisation dedicated to equality for African Americans. Evers was instrumental in leading the fight for desegregation of Mississippi schools, beaches and parks before his assassination in 1963.

He then motioned towards the ground, indicating that the rough terrain my travel companion and I were pushing our bicycles over continued long into the canyon.

""That's okay,"" I said to him in French, shrugging in the direction we'd come from. ""There's no route back that way, either."" It wasn't precisely true. While the canyon trail we'd been traversing in Morocco's soaring High Atlas mountains wasn't exactly manicured, it was nevertheless part of a brand-new bikepacking route.

We had just set out on the 837km Route of Caravans: Morocco Traverse (North), the second leg of a recently completed two-tier cycling trail traversing the length of Morocco from the town of Tiznit on the country's south-western coast to Tangier in the north. Since a digital map of the route's northern leg debuted on the adventure-cycling website Bikepacking in autumn 2024, it has lured bikepackers (off-road cyclists who carry overnight gear) to wind, slalom and climb their way from the town of Imilchil in the High Atlas Mountains past rolling hills and alpine passes to the Mediterranean port city, where they can catch a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain.

Tracing its arc from southern desert to northern beaches, the trail's two legs make use of ancient caravan roads trod by camels' hooves and shepherd paths used by the country's Indigenous Amazigh (long referred to as ""Berber"" by outsiders) communities who have called Morocco home for some 20,000 years. The route is the result of a long-held dream of a handful of adventurous international cyclists keen to forge a path through some of Morocco's least-visited regions.

Set Out Set Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.

To me, it felt like slipping through the country's backdoor and, occasionally, a bit like time travel. Following narrow paths through pastures where shepherds graze flocks on rain-fed grass, I got a firsthand glimpse of the seasonally nomadic lifestyle that still thrives in the mountains. In remote canyons, I met Amazigh women who piled their donkeys high with edible herbs and wildflowers foraged in meadows far from their mud-brick homes.

The Route of Caravans is one of many long-distance bikepacking routes sprouting up around the world in places like the Peruvian Andes, North America's Continental Divide and the Scottish Highlands where intrepid two-wheeled travellers can immerse themselves in stunning natural settings and remote communities. The challenges these routes present – such as terrain so rugged you may occasionally ""hike-a-bike"" instead of pedalling it – are all part of the appeal.

The new route also had a personal draw for me. Having travelled to Morocco decades earlier and following the classic tourist's itinerary between cities like Fez, Marrakech and Essaouira, I was haunted by glimpses of the more remote places I passed between such sites, and curious about those who lived there. Riding the Route of Caravans would be a return, of sorts – one focussed less on sites themselves than on the places in between.

After checking my steel mountain bike as baggage on the flight and strapping it with bags to carry my clothes, camping gear and equipment, I set off from the bus station at Beni Mellal, a 135km ride from the route's starting point in Imilchil, beginning a slow climb into the still-snowy summits of the High Atlas mountains. Over the next two weeks, the Route of Caravans would carry me across three mountain ranges, into ancient cities, through Amazigh villages and towards Tangier, where two seas and continents meet.

""[The route is] shockingly diverse,"" said Evan Christenson, a cyclist from San Diego, California, who scouted and designed the route for Bikepacking. ""You go from the High Atlas, which is just exposed raw granite, and into the green and rolling pastures of the Rif Mountains… There are different cultures you go through, too.""

Cycling between the villages of the High Atlas mountains, I saw the anthropomorphic yaz symbol (representing freedom and independence for the Amazigh) scrawled on the houses and shepherd huts. And while I'd heard intermingled French and Arabic in the streets of Marrakech, many of the people we met in the mountains spoke dialects of the Amazigh language Tamazight.

""Azul,"" I said, on the second day on the route, when I joined a handful of women filling bottles at a public tap in a community too small to be named on the map. The oldest among them had geometric facial tattoos on their chins and cheeks, the intersecting lines creased and blurred with time. I sat down to wait my turn, but they ushered me to the front of the line. ""Azul,"" they said, smiling. The Tamazight greeting translates, literally, as ""from the heart"".

In such moments, I felt a world away from the Morocco that has recently seen explosive tourism growth – 17.4 million travellers arrived in 2024, representing a 20% increase compared to 2023. A 2024 McKinsey & Company report on global tourism listed Marrakech as one of the cities most impacted by overtourism worldwide, with an additional 86% rise in tourism projected by 2030. Yet the Route of Caravans' far-flung villages, sheep-dotted meadows and remote stone shelters offer travellers a glimpse of Morocco few experience.

Practicalities: The Route of Caravans isn't for most novices and you'll need an off-road bike (with wide tyres that can navigate rough surfaces) to embark on it. Wild camping is generally allowed in remote parts of Morocco, though it's always best to ask locals before camping near a village or community. Nearly all cyclists bring their own bikes as checked luggage on planes, often returning to their starting point by bus – most Moroccan bus companies allow bikes. Those without bikepacking experience might consider joining a group ride, such as Intrepid's 14-day Cycle Morocco trip that journeys from the Sahara desert to the High Atlas Mountains.

Arriving in the small town of Boumia after days camping under stars and frost-touched pines, we shopped for dates and bread on the single main street and met Nabil Abdullah, a young man who'd clocked us as outsiders and hoped to practice his English. ""Here, we get maybe five or 10 tourists a month. With you, this month, I think it's seven,"" he said, before inviting us to his home for lunch.

Creating an 837km cycling route that avoids main roads in settings that are sometimes profoundly isolated requires a huge amount of work – and in this case, collaboration. In spring 2024, Christenson spent about six weeks crisscrossing the northern half of Morocco on two wheels, riding back roads and donkey trails, and exploring shepherd paths he'd spotted on satellite maps of the region. ""I had a pretty good idea of where I wanted to go,"" he explained. ""And then, if it didn't go through, I would turn around and try again.""

As Christenson created the digital map, he dropped occasional hints for riders about where to sleep, find water and buy food. Fortunately for cyclists, wild camping is tolerated across much of rural Morocco: we set up our two-person tent in rocky canyons; pine forests; and in an ancient, long-abandoned mudbrick building. One night, as dusk fell on a hilltop site in the Middle Atlas mountain range, we watched as a family of endangered Barbary macaques leaped between the crowns of towering Atlas cedars.

""It's a special perspective to be travelling through these places on a bicycle,"" said Sarah Swallow, an American cyclist who completed the 1,266km southern portion of the Route of Caravans this spring. ""It's more intimate – not only with the landscape and the natural environment, but also the people… you're vulnerable in a lot of ways, so you open yourself up to more experiences, like needing people's help, or leaning on people at times.""

Already, some ambitious cyclists are linking up the two halves for an extraordinary, country-spanning journey. Early on our trip, we met south-bound cyclists Julia Winkelbach and Christian Wagner, who had left their home in Germany the previous summer and were riding the entire 2,103km route from Tangier to Tiznit. They told me they sometimes carried 20 litres of water while riding through the Sahara, had camped through a sandstorm and found scorpion tracks around their tent.

It speaks to Morocco's astonishing contrasts that as Winkelbach and Wagner travelled deeper into the world's largest hot desert, we wound north through the softening topography and lush vegetation of the Rif Mountains. The increasingly gentle landscape and hint of sea salt in the breeze hinted that Tangier wasn't far. Approaching the coast drew us closer to the city's big resorts and tourist crowds, yet our route still felt like a rolling ramble through remote landscapes cloaked in green.

Wishing to savour the quiet for one night more, we gave a final glance towards the path leading to Tangier and turned onto a paved road that hugged a quiet stretch of coastline. Our final campsite was on a sandy beach at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. With bare feet in the sand, we stood by our bikes and waited for sunset, watching as Venus flickered above the far horizon.

The mountains at our back, we woke to the sound of waves.

From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.

Travel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects of overtourism.

In the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as the United Nations World Travel Organization, Sustainable Travel International, the Black Travel Alliance and the World Travel & Tourism Council.

As tourism in many regions soars past pre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.

From trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.

1. Dominica

Ever wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established the world's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.

New for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders from Roseau Valley up to Boiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines is launching direct flights from Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star Hilton Tranquility Beach Resort and Spa in Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such as Secret Bay, a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.

Dominica is also home to Project CETI, a groundbreaking international effort to decode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-table Lacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. – Pier Nirandara

2. Naoshima, Japan

Home to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island of Naoshima has become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks to Benesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramatically population-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.

Spring 2025 sees the opening of the Naoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year's Setouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima.

Book ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa's Teshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as an epic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalist Espoir Inn on Teshima. – Simon Richmond

3. The Dolomites, Italy

Perpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremely overtouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.

For Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages; peerless ""white week"" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change.

The ""Queen of the Dolomites"", Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns of Alta Badia and Val Gardena will launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.

But the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's new Cammino Retico (The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxury Aman Rosa Alpina hotel will have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. – Eva Sandoval

4. Greenland

There is nowhere on Earth like Greenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, its unspoiled wilderness and majestic fjords aren't just a coveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.

Stunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now.

With the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland has adopted a pledge ""towards better tourism"" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.

A modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries, Nuuk is also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north in Ilulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramatic Unesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. – Adrienne Murray Nielsen

5. Wales

Though just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as the Year of Croeso (""Welcome""). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to ""Feel the hwyl"" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.

In recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales is investing in mobility bikes to help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to the Wales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. – Eliot Stein

6. Western Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada

Labrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200km Trans-Labrador Highway – a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.

The new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (via St Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025, Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre; L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; while Gros Morne National Park will introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. – Diane Selkirk

7. Tucson, Arizona, US

Tucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive a Unesco City of Gastronomy distinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at the Presidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles of desert hiking trails and historic buildings – like the 250-year-old San Xavier del Bac, the so-called ""White Dove of the Desert"". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from the Global Destination Sustainability Movement (GDS) this year.

But while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of its city-of-gastronomy-certified restaurants or Heirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. – Lynn Brown

8. Western Australia

Known as the world's most isolated big city, Perth – and the state of Western Australia (WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, with Australia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And with new connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.

But it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeous Swan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the ""happiest animal in the world"". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new 6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.

WA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20m Jina Aboriginal Tourism Action Plan that supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on a truth-telling walking tour in Rockingham or a 4WD tag-along coast foraging tour complete with bush barbecue in Broome.

Add ancient petroglyphs at Murujuga National Park (under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunning Houtman Abrolhos Islands, boutique hotels in Fremantle and tiny dream stays in the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. – Ellie Cobb

9. Sri Lanka

From its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but a new president aims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.

The resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city of Kandy will see the opening of its first seven-star hotel, Aviyana Private Chalets, while Aarunya Nature Resort has a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a $1bn megaresort opening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airline Air Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched the Good Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.

Visitors looking for a coolcation can take a legendary train ride into its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300km Pekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers to self-drive a tuk tuk across the island, with the money going directly to the owner. – Claire Turrell

10. Panama

After managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trump hints at the possibility of using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark's Museo del Canal highlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.

11. Rif Mountains, Morocco

Snowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities and rich cultural heritage have long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But the Al Haouz earthquake of September 2023 not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation for co-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming to double its tourist arrivals in the next five years.

Bypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region. The planned 2025-2027 expansion of Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city of Fez; home to a Unesco World Heritage medina and the host of several games in the Africa Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop in Ouezzane – a centre of Sufism – then continue north to Talassemtane National Park to hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town of Chefchaouen, known as the ""Blue Pearl"" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages like El Jebha and the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings of Tetouan. – Alicia Erickson

12. Bradford, England

The diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinary open-air immersive sound walk mixing contemporary classical music with a sculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old).

Bradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's first Unesco City of Film (an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children and Wuthering Heights.

And this year, there's even an interactive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. – Norman Miller

13. Jordan

Home to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history's most mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.

Visiting Jordan While the ongoing Israel-Gaza war continues to compromise Jordan's tourism industry, both the UK Foreign Office and US State Department currently consider Jordan to be relatively safe to explore.

In 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as the Wadi Rum Trail opened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotes a slower, more sustainable form of travel that protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.

Elsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At the Wadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve (the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall. The Dana Biosphere Reserve (Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of the Aqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas in January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growing diving scene. – Florence Craig

14. Haa Valley, Bhutan

Almost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's the world's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measures Gross National Happiness instead of GDP.

The Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.

Travellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400km Trans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11km Haa Panorama Trail (a revival of an ancient route); and the two-day Joy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.

Haa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-run Katsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxury Sangwa Camp. Here, visitors witness local culture, like Bon rituals and rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan's lone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.

With Bhutan's Sustainable Daily Fee halved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. – Erin Levi

15. Hawaii, US

More than a year after a series of deadly wildfires devastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramatic downturn in visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but to do so responsibly.

16. Uzbekistan

Uzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.

Uzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with the Bukhara Biennial in September 2025. Other major cultural developments include an expansion of the State Museum of Arts designed by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of the Palace of Prince Romanov.

As of May 2024, citizens of more than 90 countries (including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create a Global Green Tourism Startup Lab to bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, the Silk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. – Kathleen Rellihan

17. Haida Gwaii, Canada

Haida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.

What makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreaking Gaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang ""Rising Tide"" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.

Visitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages like SG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as the Haida Gwaii black bear (called taan in the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept of Gina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid (""everything depends on everything else""), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. – Diane Selkirk

18. Emerald Coast, Nicaragua

Home to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrined Granada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.

Set to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which is one of the poorest in the Western hemisphere and views its growing tourism sector as key to its economic growth.

After learning to ride a wave at a locally owned surf camp and sleeping in a treehouse tucked inside a rainforest, venture to the Refugio de Vida Silvestre La Flor at the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. – Eliot Stein

19. Isle of Man

Despite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.

Awash with ancient historical sites, such as Cashtal yn Ard (""Castle of the Height"", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) and Castle Rushen (one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as a Unesco Biosphere (the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the new Manx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary of Okell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.

In addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is to explore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle's myriad of organised walking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. – Lynn Brown

20. Pakistan's Gilgi-Baltistan region

Pakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew of responsible tourism initiatives and new sustainable efforts will lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2.

Salam Pakistan (Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list of mountain peaks and treks to see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.

Yet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed ""heaven's gate"" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listed Deosai plains and Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operational year-round starting in 2025. – Aysha Imtiaz

21. Azores

Marooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and best whale-watching opportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list: Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.

In a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.

Elsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada, Furnas Valley is home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll in Terra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymous Terra Nostra Garden Hotel is a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling the cozido das Furnas – a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea at Chalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-owned Gorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. – Michelle Gross

22. Kansas City, Missouri, US

Kansas City, Missouri is making 2025 its glow-up year. The city heretofore known as ""Paris of the Plains"" is busily promoting its creative arts scene and status as one of North America's barbeque capitals, all while launching an urban revitalisation plan that includes new museums, entertainment districts and hotels.

At the heart of the rebrand is the Museum of BBQ, the world's first museum dedicated to the art of smoked meat. Slated to open at the Crown Center shopping district in spring 2025, the immersive experience will delve into Kansas City's deep barbeque culture, leading visitors through interactive exhibits culminating in a gift shop selling all manner of BBQ goods.

The Berkley Riverfront will continue to see new dining experiences, shops and apartment buildings among its incoming development.

The Kansas City International Airport completed significant renovations in 2023, with the $1.5bn expansion replacing outdated terminals and improving passenger flow. This year will also see upgrades to the KC Streetcar; a 3.5-mile Main Street extension expected to open this summer that will make it even easier to reach some of the city's premier destinations, including the Union Hill shopping district and the National WWI Museum and Memorial – home to the world's most comprehensive collection of World War One objects and documents. And when Rock Island Bridge re-opens in spring 2025, it will become the site of a new entertainment district ­set 40ft feet over a river. – Eva Sandoval

23. Bolivia

Even if you've already stargazed at the spacelike Uyuni salt flats (the world's largest) and trekked breathlessly around the hilly capital of La Paz (the world's highest), Bolivia is worth a visit in 2025. This August marks the country's 200th anniversary and it's celebrating with events and attractions throughout the year in the capitals of its nine regions.

Visit from 24 February to 5 March for the Oruro Carnival, which includes a multi-day folk-dance parade and has earned Unesco Heritage status for preserving oral tradition. In Potosí, sip a bicentennial singani (Bolivia's answer to Peru's pisco). This strong spirit, now a symbol of national pride, is said to have started viticulture in the region in the 1500s in what was once a booming mining town – and Potosí still has the colonial architecture to prove it.

Bolivia has the largest proportion of Indigenous people in South America, with roughly two-thirds of the population directly related to the area's original inhabitants. Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit the Museo de Arte Indígena for an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition. The Aymara people of the altiplano welcome visitors to the Isla del Sol (an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca) whose moonlike terrain makes for an incredible daylong hike. Elsewhere, a new network of community-based tourism brings attractions (and work opportunities) to these sometimes-remote communities, such as the Chalalan Ecolodge in the Amazon's Madidi National Park, where capybaras, cougars and macaws make their homes. – Laura Norkin

24. Botswana

Botswana has been hailed as Africa's leader in green safari tourism due to its expansive wildlife reserves and the government's focus on high-income, low-impact ecotourism policies; a strategy that has traditionally meant allowing fewer tourists. But as the country ushers in a new government and continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the ""Elephant Capital of the World"", Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listed Okavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.

The Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-powered Mbamba Camp in the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 is Monachira Camp, where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides and armchair safaris while coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl.

Starting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves – sustainably. – Eva Sandoval

25. Oslo, Norway

Visitors here are encouraged to refer to the Visit Oslo Responsibly guidelines and the Green Oslo Guide, which break down the concept of sustainable tourism into four categories: planet, people, prosperity and partnership. It's not unusual for hotels in the city centre to feature green roofs that produce food, reduce energy use, manage rainwater and support urban biodiversity.

Travellers can ensure their visit has a positive impact on residents and the local environment by supporting local businesses like the Norwegian Adventure Company, which offers ""life-changing and sustainable experiences"" from its base in Oslo, like kayaking through glacier-carved fjords, and chasing the Northern Lights. After a long day of exploring the spectacular Nordic countryside, dine at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants, like the Michelin-starred Maaemo, which utilises locally grown organic produce. So, is it even a city? Find out in 2025. – Lynn Brown

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250407-best-european-vacation-destinations,"Nine European vacation destinations to visit in 2025 if it's not your first time

9 April 2025 Share Save Stacey Leasca Share Save

From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.

While much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.

This is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval – and rows with locals – in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.

These are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.

Alamy Experts say that Italy's next hotspot is Puglia, situated at the heel of the country's ""boot"" (Credit: Alamy)

1. Puglia, Italy

Puglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays – still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.

""The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie (farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,"" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. ""The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,"" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.

Tran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves – plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.

Best time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.

2. Alentejo Coast, Portugal

Portugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.

""Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,"" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey – especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.

Who picked the list? Stacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.

The area's ""mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe"" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.

Évora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed Festas dos Santos Populares (Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm – including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.

Best time to visit: Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.

3. Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, Switzerland

About five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier – both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks – specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (£89.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.

However, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel – including a seemingly endless supply of fondue – and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.

Best time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.

4. Cap d ' Antibes, French Riviera

Cap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the Côted'Azur – an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy – and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.

The iconic Belles Rives hotel – Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s – is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. ""The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,"" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.

Beyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacré, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.

Best time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.

5. Slovenia

While Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.

At just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a ""small but mighty country"", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, ""from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave"", are a primary draw, he adds.

Independent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds ""Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,"" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.

To explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.

Best time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.

6. Peloponnese, Greece

The Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine – specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.

Of the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani – the rugged middle finger – stands out. ""Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,"" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. ""This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance."" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with ""a deep-rooted history"", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.

Elsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.

Best time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.

7. Paris, France

Paris had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.

What parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. ""Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,"" he explains, ""but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture – there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too."" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic Hôtel du Savoir, formerly called the Hôtel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Prés and is, let's just say, trés chic.

Best time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.

8. Sweden's west coast

Tourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the ""coolcation"" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.

While many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light – minus the crowds and queues of the capital.

It's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohuslän archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.

Best time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.

9. Albania

Albania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes – which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.

""Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,"" says Denison. ""The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokastër, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.""

New infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. ""Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,"" Denison adds.

While hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.

Best time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania – and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.

The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's – literally – only half of the story.

""Bring water,"" they said when I announced I'd be hiking the Sentiero dei Fortini (Trail of Little Forts). ""There's nothing out there.""

The six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort Mèsola.

My Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna – fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.

This is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.

Typically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig's Another Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.

But in Capri, glamour is – literally – only half of the story.

Anacapri: Capri's rugged little sister

The camel-humped Capri – one of Italy's three volcanic Phlegrean islands – is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; the faraglioni sea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.

Tip: While Anacapri remains the island's outdoorsy paradise, Capri Town does have a few woodsy experiences of its own. Just push past the tourists and strike out from Piazza Umberto I or Via Camerelle towards the Punta Tragara lookout and the passeggiata del Pizzolungo. This clifftop trek offers incredible views of the faraglioni, passing the Arco Naturale – a Neolithic arch – and the Grotta di Matermania, the site of pagan rituals to the Goddess Mitra. Reward yourself with lunch at Le Grottelle for rustic island dishes and mesmerising Gulf views.

But while Capri sees as many as 16,000 visitors a day – outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents – the majority only visit Capri Town.

""There's two main reasons for this,"" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor at Capri.com. ""Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.""

Formisano also believes that social media plays a part: ""People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.""

Social media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who left grand villas in his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it became a VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.

Meanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.

Orange blossom rambles and wild swimming

""Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,"" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at the Blue Grotto, Villa San Michele and the chairlift to Monte Solaro. ""But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and the Migliera [trail], and you'll find the island's heart.""

Plan your trip Arrive: Get to Anacapri via bus or taxi from Capri Town or Marina Grande. Download the ATC Go app to calculate bus routes and buy tickets. Stay: The Giardino dell’Arte offers lovely rooms and a sprawling garden. Eat: • Aumm Aumm Family-friendly restaurant serving excellent Neapolitan-style pizza. • Il Riccio Sea Lounge Jumeirah Capri Palace's luxe beach restaurant at the Blue Grotto. • Ristorante La Zagara Restaurant inside a lemon grove. The neighbouring vinoteca offers gourmet aperitivi.

Anacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.

Despite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. The ATC Capri Srl buses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red 19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved being da Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-aubergine panzanella salad. The upscale Lido del Faro features a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.

But Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets. ""It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,"" says Formisano. ""Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.""

Epic hikes with a view

It was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. ""A must-see,"" she called it.

Tip: If starting the Trail of Little Forts from the Blue Grotto, take the Anacapri-Grotta Azzurra bus from Piazza della Pace until the Orrico stop, then head to the Piazzetta di Orrico to start the trail. Allow approximately three hours to complete.

The medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.

""So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in Mèsola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,"" says Formisano.

Back in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.

""The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,"" says Formisano. ""You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.""

However, the view from Mount Solaro – Capri's highest point – is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.

Vertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.

For any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, ""stop at De Martino in Piazza Capri for an excellent panino"", advises Formisano.

Ancient transport

Most people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7km Scala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.

""It's not for everyone,"" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog, Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to ""embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.""

The Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion – built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens – is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.

""La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,"" says Minichino. ""Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.""

Alamy While stunning, the Blue Grotto suffers from overtourism, so insiders enjoy Anacapri's magical seas at nearby Gradola (Credit: Alamy)

Not-so-secret grottoes

By far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.

Formisano's hack: ""The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,"" she says. ""This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.""

But to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: ""Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for ""gradola"" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.""

Minichino agrees: ""The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.""

Quiet village life

""After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,"" says Formisano.

My B&B, Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemade ravioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.

Strolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come upon La Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries and pizzette.

But the neighbourhood stunner is the Chiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.

It's my favourite island view… until the rooftops.

Because Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels; Jumeirah Capri Palace and the historic Hotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief. Another limoncello Spritz, and I sink into a luxurious armchair, crossing my dusty ankles in their hiking boots; princess and athlete all at once.

The BBC's Wonders of Bulgaria explores Sozopol, a bustling port city where incredible relics from Antiquity are being uncovered just a few metres below the water.

Perched on a rocky peninsula, Sozopol's old town is a bird's nest of stone and timber. Solid family homes, robustly restored city walls and weather-beaten cliffs give a tight-knit, fortress vibe. But where this ancient settlement faces west, towards the small island of St Kirik, Sozopol throws welcoming arms around its natural harbour, offering sailors a safe port of call along this choppy stretch of the Black Sea coast.

Sozopol is now one of Bulgaria's most popular resorts, with medieval churches and wide sandy beaches. But it is that embracing harbour that first brought travelling ancient Greeks to Sozopol more than 2,500 years ago. The town's modern name derives from the Greek for ""City of Salvation"", but in the first millennium BC it was called Apollonia Pontica (Apollo of the Black Sea) after the great Greek Sun god Apollo. Apollonia Pontica grew into a bustling port city, complete with a substantial temple to Apollo, and a 13m-tall bronze image of the god. As far as ancient Greek statues go, this was second in size only to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Famous throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Apollonia Pontica's giant statue featured on the city's coins and was eventually stolen by the Romans.

MEET THE EXPERT Bettany Hughes is a multi-award-winning historian, author and broadcaster who has devoted the last 25 years to the vibrant and inclusive communication of the past. She has written and presented more than 50 TV and radio documentaries for broadcasters including the BBC, Channel 4, Netflix, Discovery, The History Channel, National Geographic and ITV. Bettany has been a Professor at the New College of Humanities and a Research Fellow at King's College London. She has been honoured with numerous awards including the Medlicott Medal for services to history, Europe's Cultural Heritage Prize and an OBE for services to history.

On a sunny, early spring day, it can be hard to imagine the dangers of sailing the Black Sea. But for both ancient and modern seafarers, this area can be treacherous, says Nayden Prahov, director of the Sozopol-based Centre for Underwater Archaeology. ""It's a risky sailing route, because of the southern winds on the Black Sea,"" Prahov tells me when I meet him on his dive boat Hristina, anchored among the blue and white fishing boats that line the harbour. ""This is the first safe harbour between the Bosphorus and the Balkan Mountains.""

Prahov explains that back in Antiquity, the entrance into the port was through a narrow opening at the northern end, now closed off by a breakwater. This would not have been easy to navigate; but once inside, the ships were safe, sheltered between the peninsula and St Kirik Island. ""This is the reason that the symbol of Apollonia Pontica is the anchor,"" Prahov adds with a smile.

The result is a thick layer of what was once rubbish – mostly thousands of pieces of broken pottery, from utilitarian jars to finely-painted drinking cups – but is now an invaluable source of information and evidence about one of the greatest ports on the ancient Black Sea.

Apollonia Pontica was founded by Greeks from Miletus, now in western Turkey, in 610BC. They were pioneers in a vast movement of people and ideas, a process described by some as ""Greek colonisation"" that lasted from the 8th to the 6th Century BC and saw dozens if not hundreds of settlements established around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea – as far west as southern Spain and as far east as Georgia.

WATCH: Uncovering the sunken relics of an ancient city

Apollonia Pontica was one of the first such colonies on the Black Sea. The safety of its port played a central part in transforming the sea once known to the Greeks as the Pontos Axeinos, or the ""Inhospitable Sea"", into the Pontos Euxeinos, or ""Hospitable"" one. But the Greeks did not arrive in a deserted land. This part of the world was home to the Thracians, a powerful, confident civilisation. And the trade between the local population and the Greek settlers was at the heart of the city's growth and prosperity: in exchange for grain, salt, timber and copper ore from the local mines, the Greeks brought sought-after produce from the Mediterranean, in particular olive oil and wine. During the excavations, local archaeologists have even found a glass perfume bottle from the Roman period with oily perfume still intact inside.

You don't have to look far to find that Mediterranean influence still alive and well among the cobbled streets and seafront tavernas of Sozopol today. Locals and visitors alike compete for the best harbour-side tables, laden with a fusion of Balkan and Greek cuisine: grilled fish, taramasalata, mussels and saganaki, and of course, the ever-reliable ""Greek"" salad.

Sozopol's Mediterranean character is not a fossilised relic of the long-lost ancient world that Prahov and his team are so busy uncovering. Remarkably, along with other Black Sea fishing villages that trace their origin back to Greek colonies, Sozopol remained majority Greek-speaking well into the early 20th Century, until population exchanges across the Balkans saw most of the town's ethnic Greeks abandon their homes and move to Greece itself.

We are all proud of our lineage. It's what unites us, that we are from ancient Apollonia – Aspasia Porozhanova

Some, however, remained, as Aspasia Porozhanova confirms when I sit down with her outside the Fishermen's Association clubhouse. As the Sun sets over the harbour, Porozhanova is at pains to point out that all Sozopolitans are proud Bulgarians, but that a small number of families are also determinedly hanging on to their Greek heritage. ""It's difficult to answer, 'Who are we?' or 'How long have we been here?' But we are all proud of our lineage. It's what unites us, that we are from ancient Apollonia.""

Getty Images Sozopol's wide, sandy beaches have made it one of Bulgaria's most popular seaside resorts (Credit: Getty Images)

Delightfully, Porozhanova shares her first name with the infamous concubine of Perikles, the great ancient Athenian leader. ""I'm named after my grandmother,"" she explains, ""as she was named after hers, and my granddaughter is named after me. So we pass our names down within the family."" To my fascination, she and her friends share a few words in Sozopolitan Greek, a unique dialect that most Greeks would struggle to understand.

My time with Porozhanova ends on a sweet note. Drained ouzo glasses are pushed aside to make way for a tray piled high with damga, a special kind of fried cake made according to a secret recipe and not found anywhere outside of Sozopol old town. A delicious emblem of the city's rich cultural mix, enduring character and cosmopolitan heritage.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg7x4x1lk5o,"Hostel linked to methanol deaths of six tourists set to reopen

41 minutes ago Share Save Jack Gray & Riyah Collins BBC Newsbeat Share Save

Bethany Clarke Survivor Bethany (left) says and she and Simone became ill after being offered six vodka shots

A backpackers' hostel linked to the deaths of six tourists is set to reopen under a new name. Bethany Clarke and her friend Simone White, who later died, fell ill after drinking free vodka shots in the town of Vang Vieng last November. It's suspected their drinks at the Nana Backpacker Hostel were laced with methanol - a deadly substance linked to bootleg alcohol. BBC Newsbeat has found evidence the hostel is due to reopen at the same address in August. Bethany believes the same management is still in charge.

Bethany says she and Simone, from London, became unwell a day after being offered drinks at the Nana hostel. They initially mistook symptoms for food poisoning but were eventually taken to hospital. Bethany recovered but Simone, 28, died several days later, as did five other tourists from Australia, Denmark and the US.

'Unbelievable'

The owners of the Nana hostel denied serving illicit alcohol but it has remained closed since the deaths. However, a listing for Vang Vieng Central Backpacker Hostel - taking bookings from 23 August this year - has appeared on travel websites Tripadvisor and Agoda. A link that previously took users to the Nana hostel's page redirects them to the amended page. Images showing the Nana Backpacker Hostel name painted on a sign and printed on menus remain on the page, as well as guest reviews naming the former hostel. TripAdvisor confirmed to Newsbeat the hostel was reopening with a new name. Bethany's concerned that the new business is being run by the same people it was before. ""I'm shocked. If it's the same management or ownership involved, I wouldn't trust them. ""It's just unbelievable because we know that was where we were poisoned."" A Tripadvisor spokesperson said old photos and reviews could be deleted if it was informed of a change in ownership, although it’s not a requirement. There is further evidence to suggest the Vang Vieng hostel and the Nana hostel are linked.

Supplied Backpacker Frankie told Newsbeat from Vang Vieng the hotel was ""clearly"" being refurbished

Building work is currently being carried out at the address, according to travellers staying in the area. Backpacker Frankie, who shared photos of the site with Newsbeat, says there was ""building equipment everywhere"" when she walked past on Tuesday. ""They're clearly refurbishing it,"" she says. In one photo, showing a sign reading Vang Vieng Central Backpacker Hostel, a phone number is visible. The same number appears in messages, seen by Newsbeat, sent between Bethany and staff at the Nana hostel. When a reporter called the number, the person who answered hung up. Further calls and messages, including those from BBC colleagues based in the region, were blocked. Frankie, 23, says it's ""horrendous"" to think the business could ""carry on like normal"". ""[Vang Vieng] is kind of empty in terms of backpackers. People are drinking, but it feels a bit eerie and quiet."" Frankie says people she's met on her travels are well aware of the methanol poisonings last year. ""A lot of the backpackers we've met have mentioned the name of Nana hostel. There's definitely an awareness about it,” she says. She adds the name change makes her ""very uneasy"" and she'll tell her friends about it when they travel to the country.

Social Media/Handout Holly Bowles, Simone White and Bianca Jones were three of the six tourists who died

Bethany, who previously called for more education on the dangers of drinking abroad, says she wants to warn others. ""I was not completely convinced we would end up getting justice for Simone and the other victims, so I thought the best thing I can do is to try and educate the younger generation."" And while she waits to find out whether anyone will face action over Simone's death, what little hope she had for answers is starting to fade.

In November, authorities in Laos promised an investigation into the deaths of Simone and Australians Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones, both 19, Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21, both from Denmark, and US national James Louis Hutson, 57. Eight workers, including the manager of the Nana hostel, were detained for questioning by police. The manager denied any responsibility, saying hundreds of guests had been given shots without becoming unwell. Bethany shared a recent email sent by the UK Foreign Office stating that authorities in Laos had proposed charges against 13 people over food safety breaches. Newsbeat has seen an email from the Australian government with the same update and has approached its foreign office for comment. A Foreign Office spokesperson declined to comment on the email but confirmed the UK government was in contact with authorities in Laos and supporting the family of a British woman who died in the country. Newsbeat has contacted Agoda for comment.",World

The pair are in second place - just seven hours behind leaders Caroline and Tom - ahead of Wednesday's finale.

Elizabeth and Letitia, from Worthing and Lancing respectively, have been pitting their wits against four other teams as they aim to travel from China to India without smart phones or credit cards.

One of the sisters competing for £20,000 in this year's Race Across the World has promised viewers a ""very intense"" finish to the Bafta-winning show.

Elizabeth: 'Exhausting but I'd do it again'

She told BBC Radio Sussex: ""Normally when you're travelling, if you're feeling tired you can just sit down and relax... but, one, we want to have a lovely experience and we're trying to make the most of it, but two, you're in a race so it is exhausting.""

Balancing the desire to win against enjoying the experience has tested their resolve, and while Elizabeth says the pair know each other ""way better"" now, there's still a lot to learn.

""I feel like I have understood how much there still is to know about each other,"" she said.

Contestants can only spend the cash equivalent of an airfare between the start and finish points of their travels, which span more than 8,700 miles (14,000km).

Though being well-travelled and individually skilled proved helpful, the 33-year-old says the reality is ""so different"".

“As of now, there is no need for any CBI probe. The Meghalaya police have done a wonderful job. Their line of investigation has been substantiated both by the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh police. The arrests were made only after all, including the Intelligence Bureau, were satisfied. I assure you once the probe is over. All these demands will die down, and they will agree with the Meghalaya police’s line of investigation. But just in case if there are some doubts…and some gaps are there, then we can think about it…,” Sangma told indianexpress.com in an exclusive interview.

The chief minister further said, “As of now, statements of the accused and witnesses are being recorded and the crime scene is being recreated. Police are working overtime. But we will give all help to the judiciary to ensure that the case is fast-tracked.”

Family members of both Raja Raghuvanshi, who has been killed, and his wife Sonam Raghuvanshi, accused in the murder, have been demanding a CBI probe. Raja’s family claims that more people, including Sonam’s mother, are involved in the murder, even as Sonam’s family says she is being wrongly implicated in the case.

After their wedding in Indore, Raja and Sonam travelled to Meghalaya on a honeymoon trip. They disappeared on May 23 and Raja’s body was found on June 2. Sonam went missing after that.

The murder case has brought focus to tourist safety in Meghalaya.

“Many social media handles and national media painted us black. But we were vindicated when all non-locals were arrested. People speaking against us today know that the Meghalaya people are not like that. It’s not their nature to be cruel. For us, the safety of all is very important,” Sangma said, adding that candlelight marches being taken out in many parts of Meghalaya showed what the state stood for. “It’s our culture to forgive. In Christianity, we are taught to forgive people.”

“I feel we should not fall into this trap. My only concern is Meghalaya’s name should be cleared and a clean chit should be given to the locals and the state government. Also, what we need to learn from this is how to respect citizens from other states,” Sangma said, adding that as chief minister, he would want everyone in the state to be compassionate towards the families of both the victim and the accused.

“Both families have gone through a lot in the last few days. We need to show compassion, though I agree that such harsh statements should not have been made. In fact, I would like to invite people who have been saying negative things about Meghalaya to see the kind of hospitality we offer and how we treat tourists. And it’s up to them… If they have a conscience, they would apologise,” he concluded.

“With regards to the people’s desire for a popular government, he (Shah) said the Central leaders also want the same. However, he said the matter would be discussed soon based on the developing situation in the state,” Biren Singh said, adding that they had apprised the minister on the “aggravating” conditions.

Manipur has been under President’s Rule since February 13. Recently, 23 BJP MLAs (of the party’s 37, and barring all the seven Kuki legislators) issued a statement saying that they “resolved to put aside personal ambitions” in the “larger interest” of working towards the formation of a popular government in the state. They included both those opposed to Biren and those who supported him all through the pressure to remove him.

Since then, Manipur has seen a fresh spurt of violence following action against a self-styled leader of the radical Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol, by the CBI. Biren left for Delhi along with Rajya Sabha MP Leishemba Sanajaoba on Monday, to brief the leadership on the situation in the state.

Biren said they met Shah twice, a two-hour meeting late Monday night and another 45-minute one on Tuesday afternoon. “We had threadbare discussion on issues confronting the state and also apprised him of the aggravating situation in Manipur,” he said.

“He (Shah) has given us some groundwork responsibilities, which I cannot disclose at the moment. However, civil bodies, MLAs and the public must take a unanimous stand to resolve the ongoing violence in Manipur,” Biren said.

Shah is holding multiple rounds of dialogue with various communities to address the crisis, and has appealed to all to maintain peace, the BJP leader added. He also said that the Centre is committed to maintaining Manipur’s “territorial integrity”; one key Kuki demand is a separate autonomous region for the community.

Along with Reddy, the high court also granted bail to three others – Janardhan Reddy’s brother-in-law and managing director of OMC, BV Srinivas Reddy, the then Director of Mines and Geology of Andhra Pradesh VD Rajagopal and Janardhan Reddy’s assistant Mehfuz Ali Khan.

The order was passed by Justice K Lakshman who was hearing a batch of criminal appeals filed by all four who were convicted by a CBI court. The HC has asked Reddy to furnish two personal bonds worth 10 lakh each as a bail condition. Reddy and others were also restricted from travelling abroad as a bail condition.

On May 6, a special CBI court in Hyderabad convicted all four and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for seven years for having excavated iron ore illegally from Bellary and surrounding areas. The former minister and the other three had approached the Telangana High Court pleading for suspension of their sentences and for granting them bail.

After the CBI court’s conviction, Janardhan Reddy, who was elected as BJP MLA from Gangawati constituency in Karnataka in the 2023 assembly polls, was disqualified from the Legislative Assembly.

The CBI probe into the illegal mining between 2008-2011, conducted on Supreme Court directions, found that a mining mafia allegedly run by Reddy and his associates excavated iron ore illegally from Bellary and surrounding areas and sold it to traders, who transported it to ports and exported it without forest clearances and taxes.

The CBI registered its case in December 2009. In its chargesheet, the CBI accused Reddy and others of carrying out illegal mining in Bellary reserve forest area by removing boundary markings. The chargesheet had alleged that the accused were indulged in criminal conspiracy and committed the offence of illegal mining of iron ore “by criminally trespassing into the government lands and lands of other private persons”.

Although he was first taken into CBI custody in 2011, he was rearrested in 2015 by a Special Investigation Team constituted by the Karnataka Lokayukta in the mining case.

According to Reddy’s affidavit for the 2023 Karnataka Assembly polls, Reddy has 20 pending criminal cases against him. Nine of these are being prosecuted by the CBI, of which eight are still in the trial stage.

Soon after his conviction in May, a special court for cases involving elected representatives in Karnataka ordered Reddy’s detention in the Bengaluru central prison to facilitate trial in five CBI cases of illegal mining.",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/us-backs-india-war-on-terror-its-general-for-ties-with-pakistan-too-10061162/,"As the US State Department reaffirmed its strong support for India’s fight against terror, a top US military official said the country needs to have a relationship with both India and Pakistan because of the Pakistani military’s role in countering the threat from Islamic State-Khorasan Province.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that Christopher Landau, Deputy Secretary of State, “met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism, and strategic partnership between those two countries”.

The delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor met Landau last week in Washington as part of Delhi’s global outreach effort after Operation Sindoor. Meanwhile, during a hearing Tuesday by the House Armed Services Committee, General Michael Kurilla, chief of the US Central Command, as a “phenomenal partner” in counter-terrorism.

During his testimony, Kurilla highlighted the role of the Pakistan military and Army chief Asim Munir in combating ISIS-Khorasan Province, or IS-KP.

“The actions of our Pakistani partners that led to the arrest and extradition of Mohammad Sharifullah, the ISIS-K planner behind the 26 August 2021 suicide attack at Abbey Gate that killed 13 US service members and approximately 160 civilians, highlights Pakistan’s value as a partner in countering CASA terror EXOPs threats worldwide, and it will only increase as the Taliban continues to face security challenges within its borders,” he said.

“That’s why we need… to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I do not believe it is a binary switch that we can’t have one with Pakistan if we have a relationship with India,” Kurilla said while answering questions from members of the panel, adding, “We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.”

At the State Department press briefing, Bruce also said that a Pakistani parliamentary delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari met officials of the State Department, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker, during its visit to Washington last week.

Hooker reiterated the US support for the ongoing cessation of on-ground hostilities “between India and Pakistan”, Bruce said. “They also discussed important issues to the bilateral relationship, including counterterrorism cooperation.”

Asked if the US received any assurance from Pakistan that it will take action against terrorists, Bruce said she was not going to discuss the details of those conversations.

In response to another question on President Donald Trump offering to “mediate” on Kashmir, Bruce said, “While I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard… But it is an exciting time if we can get to a point in that particular conflict.”

Delhi has ruled out mediation saying the only outstanding matter is the vacation of territory illegally occupied by Pakistan. Last month, Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said: “We have a longstanding national position that any issues pertaining to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan.”",World
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jaishankar-can-india-trust-trump-reply-10060633/,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar weighed in on India’s foreign policy priorities and ties with major global players — including the United States under Donald Trump during his visit to Brussels this week. In a conversation with European media network Euractiv, he was asked whether India could trust Trump.

Jaishankar replied: “Meaning what?”. The interviewer then expanded on the question, asking, “Is he (Trump) as good as his word? Is he a partner India is willing to deepen ties with?”

“I take the world as I find it,” was Jaishankar’s reply. “Our aim is to advance every relationship that serves our interests — and the US relationship is of immense importance to us. It’s not about personality X or president Y.”

Jaishankar’s frank comments come as New Delhi and Washington have differed over US role in the cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan. The US President has often reiterated his claim of mediating peace between New Delhi and Islamabad, while India has asserted that the decision was made strictly bilaterally.

Speaking at a campaign event on May 31, Trump once again said he “got India and Pakistan to stop fighting” by linking trade talks to de-escalation. “We talk trade, and we say we can’t trade with people who are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons… They understood and they agreed, and that all stopped,” he said.

Earlier, on May 10, when the two nuclear-armed countries agreed to stop firing and military action, the United States claimed credit for brokering the ceasefire with Trump saying the two countries agreed on a full and immediate ceasefire “after a long night of talks mediated by the United States”.

New Delhi has dismissed such remarks in the past and maintains that the ceasefire following Operation Sindoor was the outcome of direct bilateral engagement with Pakistan. Indian officials have underlined that no foreign government, including the United States, was involved — and that trade negotiations with Washington were unrelated to any security decisions made in the region.

Jaishankar, who is in Brussels to meet European Union (EU) leaders, also spoke about India’s foreign policy priorities from counterterrorism and trade to multipolarity and global trust.

Pahalgam to bin Laden

On the recent clash with Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack, Jaishankar urged the West to see India’s response under Operation Sindoor as an anti-terror operation—not a border spat.

“This isn’t merely an India-Pakistan issue. It’s about terrorism,” he said, adding: “Let me remind you—Osama bin Laden lived in a Pakistani military town, right next to their equivalent of West Point. That very same terrorism will eventually come back to haunt you.”

He also criticised the international media coverage for reducing the situation to “tit-for-tat between two nuclear-armed neighbours.”

Noting Europe’s search for “strategic autonomy,” Jaishankar said multipolarity is already here. “Europe must now make decisions based on its own capabilities and interests… I hear terms like ‘strategic autonomy’ being used—these were once part of our vocabulary,” he remarked.

Calling the EU a “major pole” in the global order, Jaishankar said: “That is precisely why I’m here: to deepen our relationship in this multipolar world.”",World
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/court-denies-bail-youtuber-jyoti-malhotra-spying-pakistan-10060925/,"A court in Haryana’s Hisar Wednesday denied bail to YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra who was arrested in May on charges of spying for Pakistan. Jyoti had filed the bail application on Tuesday, a day after her judicial custody was extended by two weeks till June 23.

Jyoti’s counsel Kumar Mukesh strongly objected to the sections imposed against her in the First Information Report (FIR). Her counsel contended in the court that the prosecution could not include any incriminating document or strong evidence which could prove her involvement in any spying network.

The counsel also pointed out that Jyoti had gone to the Pakistani High Commission in 2023 and at the time, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Act was not implemented but the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was in force. He argued that the FIR registered mentions section 152 of the BNS, which was section 124 A (sedition) under the IPC that the Supreme Court had kept it in abeyance, which is why the prosecution cannot make a case of “waging war against the state” against Jyoti.

The FIR also mentions section 3 (spying) and 5 (communicating secret information to unauthorised individuals) of the Official Secrets Act. Relying on a press release issued by the Hisar police which mentioned that they did not recover any military or policy-related or any sensitive information from her possession, her counsel demanded that the sections have no merit in the FIR and need to be dropped.

The Hisar police had previously stated that no evidence had emerged indicating that Jyoti had access to any military or defence-related information, but claimed that she was in contact with some people aware that they were Pakistani intelligence operatives.

The counsel said that one Harkirat Singh, a member of the Haryana Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, was also initially questioned along with Jyoti. Later, he was let off, but Jyoti was kept in custody.

Her counsel contended that the FIR was registered against Jyoti based on her questioning on May 15. The entire FIR was based on Jyoti’s version, which is not legally permissible. Her counsel added that the police could not place any substantial evidence on record that indicates her involvement in spying. However, the court rejected the defence counsel’s pleas and denied bail to the accused.

Jyoti was arrested from Hisar on spying charges on May 17. She stayed in police custody for nine days, after which she was sent to judicial custody on May 26. On June 9, she appeared before the court via video conference and her judicial custody was extended.

Born in 1992, Jyoti, 33, was raised by her father Harish Malhotra and grandparents. She initially worked at a private firm in Gurgaon after which she became a travel blogger. After the Pahalgam terror attack, which resulted in the death of 26 Indian tourists, investigating agencies found that she was in constant touch with Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a staffer at the Pakistani High Commission since November 2023.

Probe agencies later arrested her on charges of spying for Pakistan. Danish was expelled on May 13 for allegedly indulging in espionage. Investigators claimed that Pakistani intelligence operatives were developing Jyoti as an asset.",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/patna-double-decker-flyover-ease-traffic-10060998/,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Wednesday afternoon inaugurated state’s first double-decker flyover in Patna, a Rs 422-crore infrastructure project aimed at easing congestion along the capital’s bustling Ashok Rajpath corridor.

The 2.2-km flyover, stretching from Kargil Chowk near Gandhi Maidan to Science College, is said to be the city’s first two-lane, direction-based double-decker elevated corridor, completed in just over three years by the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited, with construction beginning January 15, 2022.

The flyover – together with ongoing metro and rail projects in the city — is being seen as a step towards “making Patna’s transport system future-ready”, with officials saying it will function as an alternative route for vehicles entering from Gandhi Setu and Krishna Ghat.

Story continues below this ad

The unveiling comes ahead of the assembly elections in Bihar.

The project was completed on May 31, 2025 and features two tiers with 8.5-metre-wide one-way carriageways. The upper deck, measuring 2,175.50 metres, runs from Kargil Chowk to Science College, while the lower deck, spanning 1,449.30 metres, connects Patna College Main Gate to Gandhi Maidan, allowing vehicles to move in opposite directions on each level.

Officials said that “uniqueness” of the Patna double decker flyover lies in its design of two separate decks with each handling one-way traffic.

This design is expected to streamline traffic flow for commuters, students, and patients around key areas like NIT, PMCH, Science College, and Patna University. The flyover integrates with the city’s emerging metro network and the JP Ganga Path, with ramps linking both decks and a lift pit for the upcoming University metro station already in progress. It further enhances connectivity to Gayghat, Patna City, and Kachchi Dargah, serving as an alternative route for vehicles entering from Gandhi Setu and Krishna Ghat.

Bihar Road Construction Minister Nitin Nabin said: “This will significantly smooth traffic on one of Patna’s busiest stretches, benefiting thousands of daily commuters”.

Officials said plans also include a connection to a proposed multi-level parking facility at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).

Another double-decker structure in Bihar announced before the Patna flyover is likely to open soon in Chhapra. It was said to be Bihar’s first such project of its kind, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar laying the foundation stone on July 11, 2018, years before the Patna Ashok Rajpath flyover’s foundation was set in December 2021. However, the Chhapra initiative, initially targeted for completion by June 2022, has lagged behind due to land acquisition hurdles.

In a tweet on X, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said: “With the construction of this state-of-the-art flyover, the traffic problems on Ashok Rajpath will be completely resolved, and Patna’s traffic system will become much smoother. Patients and their families going to Patna Medical College and Hospital will find commuting much more convenient. This flyover will give a new direction to Patna’s urban landscape and connectivity”.",Politics

However, a rare sighting of the semi-aquatic mammal has now been reported in south Kashmir.

The otter, which has been globally classified as ‘near threatened’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), was spotted in the Lidder River in Srigufwara, south Kashmir.

While villagers initially thought it was a crocodile, wildlife officials identified it as an Eurasian otter after watching videos captured by the villagers. That was later confirmed through photographic evidence.

“It has been confirmed as Eurasian otter,” Suhail Ahmad Wagar, the Wildlife Warden for south Kashmir, told The Indian Express. “After it was reported, we set up CCTV surveillance, and we have captured it (on camera) at a few places.”

The Eurasian otter, locally known as Vuder, was an integral part of Kashmir’s aquatic ecosystem and was abundantly found in the water bodies. Its presence was used to scare the children and keep them away from the water bodies.

However, over the last three decades, it was not spotted in the water bodies of the Valley, and it was thought to be extinct in Kashmir.

The sudden decline in otters, a carnivorous mammal that feeds on fish and other aquatic fauna, was attributed to increased water pollution and hunting of the mammal for its fur.

“Historical records suggest that Kashmir had a substantial otter population in Dachigam and the stream that fed the Dal lake. It was also commonly seen in Rambiara stream (in south Kashmir) and the Lidder river (in Pahalgam),” Wagay said. “However, it was not spotted for the last 25-30 years, so we thought it had gone extinct (in Kashmir).”

Wildlife officials say that this is the third occasion this year that it has been spotted in the Valley. “In May, it was first spotted in the Gurez valley,” Wagay said. “It was also spotted in Heerpora (in south Kashmir’s Shopian district).”

A bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Manmohan recorded that it is “not inclined to interfere with the orders” passed by the Delhi High Court against advocate Sanjay Rathore and dismissed his plea.

In October 2015, the complainant judicial officer was serving as a metropolitan magistrate in the Karkardooma court when Rathore, enraged by an adjournment in his matter in his absence, verbally abused the officer, including using gendered abusive language. An FIR was subsequently lodged at the Farsh Bazar police station.

Rathore was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment under Indian Penal Code Section 509 (intending to outrage modesty of a woman), three months under Section 189 (injury to public servant), and an additional three months under Section 353 (assault or criminal force against public servant to deter them from their duty). It was directed that the sentences should run consecutively, thereby resulting in a total sentence of two years.

The Delhi High Court, while refusing to reduce the sentence, however, modified it so that the sentences could run concurrently instead of consecutively. As a result, Rathore was sentenced to a total of one year and six months in prison.

The high court, in its order of May 26, emphasised that acts threatening or intimidating a judge, especially through “gender-specific abuse, is an assault on justice itself, and must be met with firm accountability”.

While refusing Rathore any relief, it further recorded in its order, “The act of outraging the modesty of a judicial officer while she was presiding over court proceedings, seated on the dais and discharging her solemn duty of dispensing justice, in this court’s opinion, attacks the very foundation of judicial decorum and the institutional integrity.”",Politics

The letter mentions four issues: non-payment and delay in payment of salaries to the employees and Self Help Group (SHG) workers; “forcing” employees to give an undertaking that they are taking salaries as loan which will have to be repaid; non-payment of medical claims, children education allowance, LTC claims, among others; and “non-transparent” and “unaccountable” functioning of the Director General and no dialogue by the DG with employees regarding service conditions post “disengagement”. Disengagement means the discontinuation of grant-in aid.

The Centre has slashed the NIRDPR budgetary allocation to just Rs 1 lakh for financial year 2025-26 from Rs 73.68 crore in revised estimates of the 2024-25 financial year and Rs 75.69 crore in 2023-24.

In its letter, the NIRDPR Academic Association has urged the minister to take action. The letter has also urged the minister to nominate two Ministry of Rural Development officers as Deputy Director General in-charge and Registrar in-charge at the NIRDPR.

Union Minister Ashwani Vaishnaw gave a presentation on the 11 years of “seva (service)”, “sushashan (good governance)” and “gareeb kalyan (welfare of the poor)” under PM Modi’s leadership. He said “humongous tasks” had been fulfilled under the Prime Minister’s leadership to put the country on the path of “long-term growth”.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari besides national spokespersons and senior party leaders attended the event organised at Bharat Mandapam in the presence of senior editors and journalists from the print media.

The presentation focussed on statistics related to 12 “big picture” achievements in each sector ranging from the welfare of the poor and the marginalised to the welfare of farmers and women’s empowerment, ease of living for the middle class, infrastructure development, affordable healthcare and enhancement of India’s per capita income from a little over `86,000 to `2 lakh, among others.

In addition to this, the Union Minister also sought to underscore the changes in the very “vision” of governance undertaken by PM Modi since taking over in 2014 with the welfare of both the nation and its citizens at their core.

“Earlier, there was competition among districts when it came to being declared ‘backward’, but PM Modi’s vision is different; these became not backward but aspirational districts… Under his government, the economy of the very country which enslaved us for 150 years has been surpassed… ‘Defence agents’, once common in Delhi’s corridors, are now a thing of the past,” Vaishnaw said.

“Instead of breaking the back of Naxalism, earlier governments used to only acknowledge its presence across what was called the ‘Red Corridor’… Article 370 was treated as a given, something that nothing could be done about, but not any more… No other Prime Minister before him made an announcement as crucial to the welfare of our girl children as the provision of sanitary pads at `1, (a promise) made from the Red Fort,” he said.

Delivering the keynote address Tuesday at the Asia Society Northern California, San Francisco, he also spoke of the need for promoting judicial literacy and transparency, saying that “without judicial literacy, transparency can be weaponised — leading to misinterpretation rather than insight.”

On the separation of powers, Justice Kant said: “The exercise of judicial power must be tempered by humility and guided by constitutional boundaries. Courts must not supplant the role of the legislature or override the will of the people. Instead they must act as facilitators of democratic dialogue — strengthening participatory governance, protecting the vulnerable, and ensuring that the rule of law prevails even in moments of political uncertainty.”

He stressed that “judicial overreach, however well-intentioned, risks unsettling the delicate balance of powers” and added: “True constitutional guardianship lies not in dominance but in restraint — an ethos that reaffirms the judiciary’s legitimacy in a vibrant democracy.”

Touching on the need for the judiciary to adjust to the realities of the digital era, Justice Kant said: “The power of the internet and social media has made judicial decisions instantly available to a global audience. This digital transparency brings both accountability and vulnerability. A nuanced decision can be reduced to a headline or hashtag, stripped of its legal complexity. In this environment, how the judiciary communicates, how it explains its reasoning, and how it carries itself with dignity and restraint, have become as important as the outcome itself.”

The judge said this change in expectations must be met not with defensiveness, but with thoughtful engagement. Calling for transparency, he said: “We must recognize that transparency is not antithetical to judicial independence; rather, it strengthens public confidence. A judiciary that shares its processes, methods, and principles in clear and open terms, empowers citizens to trust its workings, even when outcomes may differ from personal expectations.”

He, however, warned that transparency alone is not enough but must be accompanied by an active effort to foster judicial literacy — helping the public understand the complexities of legal reasoning and constitutional values.

“As courts become more visible, so too must their work become more comprehensible. Legal awareness campaigns, simplified summaries of key judgments, partnerships with educational institutions, and open dialogue forums can demystify judicial functioning,” he said.

Justice Kant said: “When citizens understand the safeguards of due process, the role of precedent, and the limitations under which courts operate, they are better equipped to both respect judicial decisions and critically engage with them in constructive ways.”

He stressed that even as the judiciary opens its processes to greater understanding and dialogue, it “must remain vigilant against the dangers posed by viral misinformation and media trials. These phenomena threaten to distort rather than deepen public engagement. Misleading narratives, selectively edited clips of court proceedings, and uninformed commentary on complex legal matters often obscure the factual matrix and legal reasoning that undergird a judgment.”

Justice Kant said that “when judicial decisions are judged in the court of public opinion before they are understood in the court of law, the result is not civic empowerment but confusion, cynicism, and, ultimately, erosion of trust.”

Pointing out that courts are often trolled for adhering to rule of law, he said this poses threat to the independence of the judiciary and added that such challenges must be firmly dealt with.

“In today’s hyper-connected world, we are witnessing the rise of a vast digital community—vocal, impatient, and often uninformed—whose engagement with law is shaped less by understanding and more by sentiment. Many among them expect courts to deliver judgments that align with their transient emotions and impulses. When courts adhere to the rule of law and the foundational values of constitutionalism, what follows is not reasoned critique, but a barrage of trolling, misinformation, and personal attacks. This phenomenon poses a subtle yet significant threat to the independence of the judiciary, especially in a globalized digital age. The challenge before us is not merely reputational—it is institutional. And it must be met not with timidity, but with the firmness and clarity of purpose that befits a constitutional democracy governed by reason, not rhetoric,” he said.",Politics

Stating it was “not possible for troops to travel such a long distance” in the dilapidated coaches, the BSF Train Commandant, who complained to the Agartala Station Manager, sought their immediate replacement.

On Wednesday, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw took “serious note of the incident involving the deployment of an unsuitable/old train” and a probe was ordered, a Ministry official said, adding that four officials – the Coaching Depot Officer and three Senior Section Engineers – of the Alipurduar railway division had been placed under suspension.

“The Railway Minister has made it clear that the dignity and comfort of security forces are of utmost priority and that such negligence will not be tolerated at any level,” the official said.

In the complaint to the Agartala Station Manager, the BSF Train Commandant had listed all that was wrong with the coaches – broken interiors including toilet doors, infested with cockroaches and insects, filthy berths and washrooms without water or electricity.

The BSF Train Commandant said “it is not possible for troops to travel such a long distance… in unhygienic/filthy and inhumane conditions” and there is every possibility that “most of them may fall sick even before deployment”.

The officer sought immediate replacement of the dilapidated coaches, and also said the special train should be “immediately placed for timely travel” to “reach the destination as per schedule given by MHA and BSF Force HQs”.

The BSF attached four files of videos and photographs of the allotted train.

Hours after the attack the police had arrested Islam’s father and brother.

The delegation stated that Islam’s residence was ransacked by a gang of miscreants allegedly backed by the BJP on June 8, centering around his statements on animal sacrifice posted on Facebook.

The 6:1 majority decision overruled the 2004 judgment in E V Chinnaiah vs State of Andhra Pradesh that had held that Scheduled Castes constituted a homogeneous group and cannot be sub-categorised.

CJI Gavai said that “for India’s most vulnerable citizens, the Constitution is not merely a legal charter or a political framework. It is a feeling, a lifeline, a quiet revolution etched in ink.”

Recalling his journey from a municipal school to the office of the Chief Justice of India, CJI Gavai said that the Constitution “has been a guiding force”. “This is what the Constitution did. It told the people of India that they belong, that they can speak for themselves, and that they have an equal place in every sphere of society and power,” he added.

The CJI said that “the Constitution of India carries within it the heartbeat of those who were never meant to be heard, and the vision of a country where equality is not just promised, but pursued. It compels the State not only to protect rights but to actively uplift, to affirm, to repair”.

CJI Gavai said that Dr B R Ambedkar “saw representation as a necessary check—a system of constitutional checks and balances—to guard against the arbitrary power and social hegemony of dominant caste and class groups”.

“He understood that in a society where inequality had been systemically entrenched, change would not come naturally or voluntarily. Therefore, the constitutional text itself had to carry the weight of a mandate— a mandate to protect, to empower, and to ensure representation,” he added.

CJI Gavai said that the “constitutional guarantees” on representation “reflect a vision of substantive equality, which goes beyond formal equality and requires the State to take positive action to correct historical disadvantages”.

The CJI added, “The true beauty of Indian democracy lies in this: even as we commemorate 75 years of the Constitution, we continue to reflect, renew, and reimagine how to deepen and expand the meaning of representation. Just last year, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment to provide political reservations for women in Parliament and state legislatures.”",Politics

Los Angeles Protest News Live Updates: About 700 US Marines are set to be deployed on the streets of Los Angeles within 48 hours, joining National Guard troops amid escalating protests over immigration raids. The Marines, currently completing crowd-control and use-of-force training, will be tasked with safeguarding federal property and personnel, but will not have arrest authority. They can only temporarily detain individuals until local law enforcement arrives.

What has been happening on the protest front? Since Saturday, the Los Angeles Police Department has made nearly 400 arrests and detentions linked to the protests, according to the Associated Press. Most were for failing to disperse after police orders. A few face more serious charges, including assaulting officers and possession of a gun and a Molotov cocktail.

What sparked the protests? Protests in Los Angeles began on June 6 after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted sweeping raids across the city, detaining dozens of undocumented immigrants at workplaces and in public spaces. The aggressive tactics sparked immediate backlash. This led to demonstrations demanding an end to the raids and calling for the protection of immigrant families.

Most were detained for refusing to disperse when ordered, police said. A few face more serious charges, including assault on officers and possession of weapons like a Molotov cocktail and a gun. In downtown LA, tensions escalated Wednesday night. Police, more aggressive than the previous day, charged protesters near City Hall, striking them with batons and firing crowd-control projectiles. Meanwhile, protests also spread to Seattle, where hundreds marched peacefully from Capitol Hill toward downtown with no visible police presence.

While critics, including Republican ex-Rep. Adam Kinzinger, argue only American flags should be flown, others see the flags as expressions of cultural pride. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called protesters left-wing radicals, accusing them of attacking agents removing “criminal illegal aliens.” But historians and Latino leaders say the flags reflect a deeper story of identity. “People don’t like to see some flags over others,” said historian Kris Hernández. Activists note that many Mexican Americans descend from people who lived in California before it became part of the US. Hector E. Sanchez, president and CEO of the nonprofit “Mi Familia Vota,” which works to mobilise Latino voters, said the Mexican community has often borne the brunt of immigration-related attacks, particularly during both of Trump’s presidential campaigns. He questioned why flying the Confederate flag alongside the US flag isn’t labelled anti-American. “Why is it that the Mexican community is constantly under attack?” (With inputs from AP) 11:24 (IST) 12 Jun 2025 Los Angeles Protests Live News Updates: California Governor sues to block military role in immigration raids California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit to stop US troops from assisting federal immigration agents, calling the deployment an “assault on democracy,” as per The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)

WTC Final 2025, SA vs AUS Day 1 Highlights: Kagiso Rabada’s five-wicket haul helped South Africa clean up Australia for 212 runs but Mitchell Starc has ruled the roost since then. He dismissed Aiden Markram in the very first over of the South African innings and then went on to send back his opening partner Ryan Rickelton. Starc ended up bowling seven overs on the trot and South Africa eked out just 19 runs in the first 10 overs. Eventually, South Africa ended the day limping on 43/4.

Rabada and Marco Jansen earlier hunted in pairs to help South Africa keep Australia from running away with it. Jansen finished with figures of 3/49, with Keshav Maharaj and Aiden Markram taking a wicket each. Australia had a good period with the bat in the second session but that was preceded and followed by South Africa’s bowlers ruling the roost. Australia lost as many as five wickets in just 6.4 overs after Tea. South Africa had won the first session by taking four wickets and so overall, they have got their noses ahead on Day 1.

Smith and Webster saw off the time when the pacers had help from the conditions and started to dominate the bowlers in the second session. However, when the wicket did come, it was Smith who fell. The former Australia captain looked to be as serenely steady as ever when he was caught at first slip quite brilliantly by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram and had to walk on 66 off 112 balls.

Smith stood strong while South Africa dominated the first half of Day 1 and eventually raised his 42nd Test fifty in the second session.

https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/pahalgam-attack-modi-3-0-caste-census-politics-10061693/,"When the BJP won only 240 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in June 2024, many felt that the ride for Narenda Modi might get bumpy in his third term. And that he would be compelled to rely on his NDA allies – something not perceived to be part of the political DNA of the Prime Minister used to getting his way.

Modi enters the second year of his third term, no small achievement, with his allies batting even more convincingly for him than was the case last year. They include Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP (16 Lok Sabha seats), Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of the JD (U) (12 seats), Chirag Paswan of the LJP (RV) with his 5 seats and others. On its part, the BJP has shown a flexibility in catering to the needs of its allies. The party has decided, for instance, to fight the upcoming Bihar elections under Nitish’s leadership to keep him by its side. Nitish’s ill health has made him even more unpredictable.

The BJP leadership had to contend with a not-too-happy RSS in the Lok Sabha elections. The Sangh’s “indifferent stance” was among the key factors that brought down the party in UP from 62 seats to 33 while reducing its national tally well below the majority mark.

The below par 2024 poll results and the parleys that followed between the RSS and BJP leaders may not have fully resolved all issues (the decision on the next party chief’s appointment is pending). It, however, galvanised the Sangh workers, who came out to campaign vigorously for the BJP in subsequent polls, like in the past, contributing to the party’s victory in Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi. The three back-to-back wins helped the BJP regain its lost steam.

The Sangh is now maintaining a low profile. The celebrations for 100 years of the founding of the RSS this year have been subdued so far. The Sangh is not questioning Modi’s leadership regardless of any possible reservations it might have. It would however like to continue having a say in the BJP’s organisational matters even as it is a given that Modi will be the party’s “chehra” in the 2029 Lok Sabha polls too.

The Pahalgam terror attack was a defining milestone in the first year of the Modi government 3.0. The ceasefire announced on May 10 between India and Pakistan came in for criticism from the extreme Right, a constituency the PM has to contend with—and in some ways, the BJP leadership became a victim of its own high-pitched rhetoric.

Soon after the ceasefire, trolls on social media took aim at the PM for not capturing PoK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) and inflicting more damage on Pakistan. This was compounded by Donald Trump announcing the ceasefire and going on to repeat it multiple times that the US had brokered it. It would have been a different story had the Government announced the ceasefire after the Pakistan DGMO’s talk with his Indian counterpart.

The principal Opposition Congress tried to stoke the row with Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi framing it as “Surrender by Narender ”. That jibe jarred many – especially at a time when multi-party delegations were abroad mobilising global support for India’s position and its Operation Sindoor.

These seven “Sindoor delegations” sent to 33 world capitals helped the PM control any domestic political damage and reseize the initiative. Whatever be the impact these delegations had on the policymakers in the countries they visited, back home they sent a powerful message of unity at a time of national crisis. For all their differences, leaders from different parties spoke with one voice on national security and against terror emanating from Pakistan, they were all sincere and strong.

Several Opposition delegates also seemed to have gained from the diplomatic mission. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, attacked by some quarters for taking a Muslim hardline approach on issues, was hailed widely for tearing into Pakistan. A “kattar” Hindu from Varanasi told Congress leader Salman Khurshid that he wanted to come and touch his feet after the stand he took on Kashmir. While abroad, Khurshid supported the abrogation of Article 370 as it had marked Kashmir’s “separateness”.

The global outreach thus helped the Opposition leaders acquire a “nationalistic” profile, with some of them seen to be articulating the government’s line more effectively than even some of the BJP delegates. Can “nationalism”, which has been a core issue of the BJP, become as much of an issue of the Opposition, helping it to shape a new narrative? Much will depend on how the Opposition chooses to build on this.

Modi enters the second year of his third term with new opportunities and huge challenges facing him.

The situation in Jammu and Kashmir represents a new opportunity for the Modi government to address the demand for restoration of its statehood. After the Pahalgam attack, J&K stood with the rest of India in a way not seen in recent years.

In view of the rise of the extreme Right and the challenge posed by Pakistan- backed terror and its ecosystem, the PM may be called to fashion a politics with a different focus.

What gave the government strength in its outreach programme was the absence of a Hindu-Muslim conflict in the country which Pakistan would have hoped to accentuate through the Pahalgam strike —as a backlash to the terrorists ascertaining the religion of the men they killed in front of their families.

The Hindu-Muslim unity, frayed in recent years, held after Pahalgam—it is something the PM could build on. Though polarisation politics has yielded the BJP electoral dividends, has it become a risky card to play, given the geo-political situation that is now emerging in the neighbourhood?

But then the Modi-led BJP may have to put together a somewhat different constituency. One of Modi’s achievements has been to help the BJP transit from a Bania- Brahmin outfit into a party which has the backing of almost all communities today —though its hold among the minorities is weak, with Muslims continuing to feel marginalised and insecure.

The PM decided to go in for a caste census, despite reservations from within the Sangh Parivar—and despite its demand coming most vocally from Rahul. With it, Modi chose to throw the net wider, aiming at a larger catchment area—for the allegiance of the OBCs, the extremely backward castes and the most backward groups among Dalits and even the Muslim community.

The population Census along with the caste enumeration will be completed in March 2027, which is expected to trigger fresh demands for reservations from more communities. With women emerging as a critical constituency, the implementation of the already-enacted Women Reservation Act is contingent on the completion of the delimitation exercise which will follow the Census. It is unclear whether this can happen in time for 2029 or will have to await till 2034. Delimitation will also pose a major challenge with resistance expected from the Southern states.

Given these challenges, will Modi move towards the politics of alliances as a strategy and not just as a compulsion—and strike inclusive notes – keeping in mind 2029? Or will he go back to the old, tried and tested method of polarisation? Only time will answer these crucial questions.

https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/jaat-sunny-deol-bollywood-doesnt-have-sense-of-humour-10060370/,"The smartest thing that Himesh Reshammiya has probably done in his professional life, besides transitioning from composer to singer, is to embrace the inherent ridiculousness of his stage persona. For the longest time, he seemed entirely unaware. He’d perform bicep curls to his own love songs on Instagram, seemingly oblivious to how meme pages were responding. But something changed after Janhvi Kapoor went on Koffee with Karan and essentially pulled the curtain on what was maybe the greatest inside-joke of our times. Two years down the line, Reshammiya is starring in a movie called Badass Ravikumar and going on a ‘Cap Tour’ of sold-out live shows. It’s genius. If only Sunny Deol had the same self-awareness in Jaat.

Bollywood, and, for that matter, India’s other regional industries, are consumed by a seriousness that borders on devotion. How can Salman Khan poke fun at himself in Sikandar when people literally make pilgrimages to his house on religious occasions? Laughing at some of Rajinikanth’s antics would probably get you stabbed. Anirudh Ravichander would have to leap off the stage and diffuse the tension. It would be a whole thing. But one thing’s clear: half of our country’s most terrible movies would instantly become 20% better if they simply realised that they are comedies first, and revenge epics second. For roughly an hour, shockingly, Jaat seems to get away with it.

Directed by Gopichand Malineni in his Hindi-language debut, Jaat inevitably falls into the same trap that has consumed so many of Bollywood’s Jawan clones in the recent past; movies such as Baby John, Bhaiyya Ji, and, yes, Sikandar. The second half is overwhelmingly straight-faced, despite Deol’s typical brand of high-decibel drama. This transition feels more jarring because the first half is genuinely enjoyable; it’s nimble on its feet, playful, and miraculously, in on the joke. For over an hour, the only thing motivating Sunny Deol’s stock character is a stubborn, egotistical desire to score an apology. Not because someone insulted his mother or something — we learn nada about his family — but because a bunch of goons bumped into him at a roadside eatery, and sent his nice idli breakfast tumbling to the ground.

Sunny Deol in a still from Jaat. Sunny Deol in a still from Jaat.

The head goon refuses to apologise, which activates the animal inside of Sunny Deol. Punches are thrown, heads are smashed into walls, a radiator explodes. Sunny Deol stops an SUV from driving away by tugging at it with his ‘dhai kilo ka haath’. The kind old woman who’d served him the hot idlis is never heard from again; her unassuming establishment lies in rubble. The head goon threatens Sunny by name-dropping his boss, a local politician. The next thing we know, our hero is demanding an apology from him. The politician laughs in his face and promptly gets beaten up as well. He name-drops his own boss, a man gangster named Somulu, played by Vineet Kumar Singh.

Somulu has a thing that he does where he howls like a wolf for no reason. “Aaaooo,” he goes, at random moments. It’s all very funny. Sunny Deol shows up at Somulu’s doorstep and asks for an apology again. “Main idli kha raha tha…” he begins. Somulu scoffs in his face, only to get smacked senseless by a ceiling fan that Sunny Deol rips from its socket and waves around like a broom. He stops howling for a second and tells Sunny Deol that his elder brother is the dreaded mob boss Ranatunga. “Woh tera khoon pi jayega,” he screams. Someone put this man and Chhaava’s poet person in a room together and give them some ginger lemon honey tea, please.

Played by Randeep Hooda, Ranatunga is next in line to be hit with Sunny Deol’s spiel (among other things). “Main idli kha raha tha…” To his surprise, Ranatunga apologises. Sunny Deol is stunned. It’s like he no longer has a purpose, because it seems like he was prepared to take his grievances all the way up to God Himself. He blows a kiss at Ranatunga and says, “Love you, sir,” and leaves. We’re over an hour into the movie at this point, and all we’ve seen is one man get an apology after beating up at least three dozen goons. If only Jaat had chosen this exact moment to end. Five stars, no notes.

Sunny Deol’s character doesn’t so much drive the plot of Jaat as he stumbles into it. You’d think that there would be a grand reveal at the end, confirming our suspicions about his character being some kind of secret agent sent to bring Ranatunga to justice. But no, the movie relies entirely on a series of coincidences. Had Sunny Deol not gone on his apology quest, he’d have never even set eyes on Ranatunga. Had he not felt like breakfast, he’d have never set foot in the old lady’s eatery. Heck, had his train not been delayed, he’d have been in Ayodhya. We have to have a sense of humour about all this; what are we even doing with our lives if we’re not pointing at the screen and chuckling at the sight of Sunny Deol addressing the two years younger Zarina Wahab as ‘Amma’?

Sunny Deol in a still from Jaat. Sunny Deol in a still from Jaat.

The big reveal that Jaat actually delivers is completely pointless. They tell us that his name is Baldev Pratap Singh, as if that’s supposed to mean anything to us. Had his name been Kuldip Singh from the movie Border, the reveal would’ve actually worked. It’s a clear sign that whatever playfulness that Jaat had in the first half was definitely too good to be true, and possibly even a fluke. It’s possible, considering how hesitant movie stars here are to have a laugh at their own expense. Sunny Deol’s own brother has convinced himself that inspiring Lord Bobby memes is the same thing as being venerated with an Indian Idol tribute episode. It’s difficult to imagine an Indian movie star poking fun at themselves like Leonardo DiCaprio did in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; in fact, Brad Pitt is at his best when he’s playing absolute morons. Remember Burn After Reading?

When Rohit Shetty complains that audiences question the logic in his films but praise their Hollywood counterparts, he fails to recognise one key point. There is a difference between logic and internal logic. Cars will flip in both Singham Again and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, but not in the same way. Were Ethan Hunt to hop into a Bolero and send it somersaulting down an empty highway in slow motion, people would most definitely complain, because it wouldn’t be consistent with the internal logic of the Mission: Impossible movies.

Story continues below this ad

Jaat establishes its internal logic early on, when it shows us that the ground literally trembles beneath Sunny Deol’s feet. For it to turn into a soapy social drama towards the end, one in which several women are seemingly gang-raped by villains, is abhorrent. It would take a genius to reconcile such gaping tonal dissonance, and despite what Sunny Deol told BeerBiceps about his IQ being over 160, he ain’t it.",Entertainment
https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/music/britney-spears-and-lata-mangeshkar-share-the-same-connection-that-parineeta-the-film-and-louis-armstrong-do-and-it-has-to-do-with-cheating-10059063/,"Pradeep Sarkar’s romantic drama Parineeta turned 20 this week. The film, which is based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel of the same name, boasts a stellar cast, linear but effective writing, and an album which draws you in and keeps you in the chamber of bliss and desire that it has created. One of the most well-known tracks from the film is Sunidhi Chauhan’s ‘Kaisi Paheli Zindagani’, which features the mesmerising Rekha, who makes one forget all their troubles as she dances around on the beautiful composition by Shantanu Moitra. What Moitra, Sunidhi, Rekha and Sanjay Dutt’s oddly placed saxophone performance in the song also makes you forget is that this tune doesn’t belong to any of these people.

The bluesy and groovy chorus actually comes from a song released 17 years before Moitra was even born, and that song was ‘A Kiss To Build A Dream On’ by Louis Armstrong. If you can’t remember him (which I doubt), he is the man that also performed the legendary track ‘What A Wonderful World’, written by Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby and Oscar Hammerstein II in 1935. The original tune was interestingly composed for a song called ‘Moonlight on the Meadow’, but it sat on the shelf until Oscar adapted it for the lyrics of ‘A Kiss To Build A Dream On’. Bear in mind that no one is discrediting Moitra for what he did with the album and the song. Maybe he, like many other composers, musicians and artists in the world, believed in the old adage, “You’re not trying if you aren’t cheating.” He took ‘inspiration’ and created a track that has stood the test of time and is still very prevalent in the track list of singing reality show contestants. In all sincerity, it is a serene performance by Sunidhi and it only goes to prove that we have the skill and the appetite for all kinds of different sounds, both as creators and consumers.

There have been enough discussions about Indian composers and how the line between inspiration and ripping off in their minds is not just blurry; it’s non-existent. It is quite easy to sit down and start bashing these artistes who, even though they made great songs, never really made anything original. So in the interest of doing something different, we are going to focus on the times when the West took inspiration from our Maliks and Pritams (not exactly) and used our sounds to make hits of their own, and while there are many examples of this phenomenon, we are going to focus on a select few.

When Asha Bhosle’s song was ripped by pioneers of hip-hop

The first on this very less talked about roster is a song from the 1963 film Taj Mahal, titled ‘Chandi Ka Badan’, and the song had two female and male singing parts sung by Asha Bhosle, Meena Kapoor, Manna Dey and Mohammad Rafi. This quick-paced Qawwali track with several tempo and cadence changes somehow lit a fire of innovation in producer Just Blaze as he started cutting and editing parts of the song to create a base for himself, the foundation upon which he would make the song ‘React’, which was the lead single on Eric Sermon’s album of the same name. The song also features one of the pioneers of hip-hop, Redman, and listening to the track almost feels like you’re consuming a creation that hails from a parallel universe. People keep talking about the things we got before GTA 6, but we had Asha Bhosle and Redman on the same song before we ever got GTA San Andreas (2004); let that sink in.

Lata Mangeshkar track featured in Britney Spears’ biggest hit

This seems like a natural segue, as the next track we are talking about concerns Bhosle’s sister, the great Lata Mangeshkar. The nightingale of India appeared on some of the most iconic songs of Bollywood in a career that lasted longer than Queen and The Beatles combined (one point for the colonies, I guess). Her song ‘Tere Mere Beech Mai’ with S P Balasubramaniam from the movie Ek Dujje Ke Liye (1981) was a massive hit, and it must have transcended international boundaries because producers Bloodshy and Avant definitely liked what they heard. They liked it so much, in fact, that they chopped the sample (when a producer takes out specific pieces from the track, and not the complete melody or bar as a whole) and put it in a song which arguably became the calling card for the ‘Princess of Pop’, Britney Spears. The sample taken from the Mangeshkar song was used for Spears’s ‘Toxic’, a track that became the artiste’s first and only track on Spotify to hit a billion streams. It also got Spears her only Grammy award; even though it was for Best Dance Recording, we will gladly chalk that up as a win in our books.

When Timbaland borrowed Indian sounds

Let’s take a short detour to explain our next entry. Producer and rapper Dr Dre is known for his skill of isolating certain sounds from previously made tracks and using them to create something entirely new. Dre acknowledges the skill and prowess of those who came before him and uses it to his advantage. However, many Indian producers refuse to look at the work of their predecessors and fall into the trap of romanticising the West, even though in Anu Malik’s case the West can be as close as Iran. Another producer like Dre, who believes in learning from yesterday to create for the present, is Timbaland. The producer and rapper has gone on record several times and talked about his love for Indian culture, especially the music. Now don’t get me wrong, not everyone from the ‘land of the brave and free’ is able to look beyond the surface-level attractions our country has to offer, and people like the aforementioned gentleman are definitely an exception. Timbaland has talked about his obsession with Indian instruments and showcased his love for the same in his track ‘Indian Flute’. While the song in itself appropriates every stereotype that Indians have about hip-hop and Americans have about our ‘exotic’ country, it puts the sounds from our country on the centre stage. He samples the Been or the Pungi for the track and has repeatedly used Indian string instruments in other tracks as well.

What one hopes to achieve from constructing a narrative like the one above is to instill a sense of self-belief in the upcoming and existing crop of music producers of the country. Indian music is currently going through a big transition; fusion music has never been bigger, hip-hop finally has some self-owned ground to stand on, and there is an actual quantifiable wave of new talent emerging from the country. While a track like ‘Kaisi Paheli Zindagani’ or Mohammad Rafi’s ‘Kaun Hai Jo Sapno Mai’ (sampled from Elvis’ Marguerita) are great examples of inspiration done right, it can be argued that we don’t really need them. What we need from our musicians is to read the literature and inform themselves with the godlike music pieces that Indians have created since time immemorial. Bands like Agnee need to be studied, and bands like Bombay Bandook need to be supported. Musicians like Laxmikant-Pyarelal need to be studied, and musicians like Amit Trivedi need to be given their due, not just for the music they make for films but for their own creations, for tracks that aren’t moulded to a narrative but are only shaped according to the artiste’s free will and beliefs. If the saying “You aren’t trying if you aren’t cheating” really is true, then maybe we can start peeping into assignments created by our own alumni. Maybe all we need to do is acknowledge our own greatness, and then we can shine bright enough to light up the entire world, one song at a time.",Entertainment

Their pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, given his back troubles, is not certain to play more than three Tests even if there are sufficient rest days in between. Mohammed Siraj, who famously bowled India to a thrilling win at Lord’s in 2021, hasn’t evolved as much as one would have hoped and is struggling to find rhythm off late with the red-ball which used to be his strength.

Beyond the two, there is Prasidh Krishna, a seamer India are pinning plenty of their hopes on, for his lateral movement and the extra-bounce he generates with his height are seen as valuable assets. And beyond the trio, expected to start the first Test at Headingley, is Akash Deep – a seamer in the mould of Shami, who if the typical English conditions happen to be on offer, could make the Duke ball move either ways. To offer the left-arm variety, there is Arshdeep Singh who could get a look-in at some point in the series if India find their pacers to be one dimensional. And beyond this frontline pace pack are two seam-bowling all-rounders in Nitish Kumar Reddy and Shardul Thakur to go with the spin trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar.

This is as rounded an attack India could have hoped, particularly at a time when their batting is going through a massive transition and need their bowlers to keep opposition’s total under check.

Speaking after their third net day’s practice session at Beckenham, India’s fast bowling coach Morne Morkel said the first challenge is to get them in Test match shape. Since their tour of Australia ended in January first week, India haven’t played any Test with Siraj and Prasidh being the lone ones to play one Ranji fixture in between.

“In terms of the pace attack, we cover all the bases. The key thing is to get Test match fit ready, get the sharpness back. We haven’t played Test cricket for a while now and in England the conditions can suit you, it is overcast, but it can still be good wickets and we will be tested. In terms of balance we have got, really happy with that. But as a bowling group, finding that the gears we need to have in Test matches is important. We have spoken a lot about how to match up England and so far we are on the right way. It is about executing,” Morkel said.

In their last two tours to England, India have employed contrasting bowling combinations. In 2018, a series they lost 1-4 but by narrow margins, with Hardik Pandya in as seam-bowling all-rounder, they played three fast bowlers and one spinner in four Tests with R Ashwin and Jadeja being the preferred ones. At Lord’s they played both Ashwin and Kuldeep – his only Test in England – as in bowling-friendly conditions, India chose to strengthen the batting depth. In 2021, India played four pacers and Jadeja with Bumrah and Siraj playing all as conditions favoured seamers.

But this time, going by the recent trends, it would be interesting to see how India go about their bowling combination. Since England adapted their Bazball approach, they have seldom played on seaming decks with good batting-friendly pitches being the ones rolled out in most venues. Unless the overcast conditions come into play, the movement from the surface has been minimal. Even in County cricket this season, runs have been the norm and it is the reason why for their ongoing practice session at Beckenham, India requested the curators to serve them good pitches rather than green tops.

Morkel said as much that India don’t expect the Test pitches to offer too much movement or bounce. “Very happy with the preparations so far. The wickets are doing a lot more. But it is common at this ground — Beckenham is famous for its extra bounce and pace and we don’t think we are gonna see that sort of movement and bounce in the series. But it is good for the guys to get used to the Duke ball, working on different skill sets that would be useful in the Test series,” he said.

Much would also depend on the overhead conditions in England as the first day of the WTC final has already shown. It was supposed to be a dry-ish batting-friendly track but with overcast conditions present the ball moved around for the pacers and Australia were bowled out for not much.

If India take their own winning blueprint with regards to how they humbled the Bazballers last year at home, they might be looking at playing two spinners, particularly Kuldeep whose wrist-spin could conjure magic against a batting line-up that prefers to go on the offence. And come first Test, Morkel emphasised the need to hit the strides straight away for if England’s batting comes along, teams have found it hard to stop.

“With the type of cricket England play, we have to be on top of our games,” Morkel said. “We can’t really afford to find our feet in the series. That’s the thing that has impressed me over the last two days here, where the guys have stepped up and taken ownership and responsibility, realising it is going to be a tough tour and that is pleasing to see as a coach.”",Sports
https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wtc-final-day-1-kagiso-rabada-steve-smith-austrlia-south-africa-10061395/,"Under crisp sunshine, South Africa captain Temba Bavuma and his partner David Bedingham retreated with relieved smiles to the pavilion. They would reflect on a day that was as satisfying as it was harrowing. If bowling out Australia for 212 was worthy of contentment, the score of 43/4 at stumps, and the shocking ineptitude of their top-order, would spook them.

An Australian backlash was imminent. The deck still had enough juice to provoke the devils, even though the sun was blazing; South Africa’s batting line-up is incredibly thin on grand-stage experience; and the trifecta of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood is as opportunistic as bowling cartels come. Starc removed the most gifted of them, Aiden Markram, with the last ball of the first over. The left-armer winkled out Ryan Rickleton, before Cummins and Hazlewood grabbed one apiece to leave South Africa reeling and anticipation already bubbling for another action-packed day.

Rabada’s elite display

Until the collapse, the day belonged to Kagiso Rabada, who eclipsed Allan Donald as the fourth-most prolific wicket-taker for his country. He illustrated ample virtues to justify his place among the elites. Returning to competitive cricket after serving his suspension, Rabada showed no signs of rust. He rustled in, supple, graceful limbs hauling his symmetrical frame and the fire in his heart. The first ball, an in-swinger that jagged back menacingly to Usman Khawaja, set the drumbeats rolling for the seam-swing orchestra of Rabada, the most athletic and artistic of contemporary speed merchants. Jasprit Bumrah ignites raw excitement, Cummins marvels with his scientific fix of pace, precision and length mastery. But Rabada makes the most difficult art disbelievingly frictionless. He is both subtle and direct; he could swing the ball both ways by shuddering margins, he could move the ball just adequately to kiss the edge. He can be a violinist as well as a drummer, could morph into a savage quick, as well as kill batsmen softly.

On a cold and damp morning, he waited 21 balls for his first wicket, inevitably of Khawaja, luring his edge with a ball on fourth-stump, just holding its shape and bouncing a trifle more than the left-handed opener was anticipating. The only mystery was how he survived Rabada’s new-ball onslaught that long. The away-nibblers had him poking uncertainly twice. Rabada then pushed him to the back-foot by shortening the length, before slipping the fuller one and catching him at the crease. Khawaja would vouch that it’s easier dealing bowlers with default lengths than those that interchange them with immaculate dexterity.

His roar was so loud that it could have shivered the grand arena. He only grew louder as the match unfolded. The same over, he produced a wobble-seamed pearler that swung in and kicked away just a smidgeon, pouncing the outside edge of Cameron Green, captured low by the swooping claws of Markram. Rabada waited deep into the day for his next cluster of wickets, only because he was grossly unfortunate in his second spell after lunch.

Smith finds his hands

The second session unfolded with a smiling sun and a splendid Steve Smith, cover-driving and cutting with languid disdain. The Smith cover drive deserves a special entry in cricket lexicon, for the sheer improbability of infusing surreal grace from an antithetical set-up, the upper body swaying to the other side, left-shoulder closing, bottom-hand heavy and weight on the back foot. Yet, his bat traces a perfect, rasping arc, the bat traipsing a straight, fluid line and the elbow high and upright. All the incongruent parts rebelling to produce a most congruous stroke. He slapped Rabada through backward point for a four to bring up his fifty, before he nipped one back onto his pads. Smith had shouldered arms and was only saved by the delivery’s height.

The in-swinger, both of conventional and wobble seam, ran both Smith and Beau Webster ragged. The latter was repeatedly pinged on the pads, and the most straightforward one went unreviewed. It could have ended Webster’s early torture on eight. The Tasmanian then recovered to post 72, his 79-run stand with Smith formed the spine of Australia’s innings, which was tottering at 67 for 4 when Marco Jansen ejected Travis Head, caught acrobatically down the leg-side by wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne. Jansen bowled with heart and heat, composed a stunner to consume Marnus Labuschagne. But the waywardness of Lungi Ngidi and Wiaan Mulder enabled Smith and Webster to recover.

It looked as though Smith, in impregnable form, would make South Africa pay for the second-session slumber. But Markram’s golden arm produced the breakthrough against the run of play. The part-time off-spinner was introduced so that Mulder could bowl down the slope. Smith’s eyes lit up, but over-enthusiasm induced indiscretion, as he threw his hands at a tossed-up ball outside the off-stump, only for an edge to fly backwards, where Jansen pouched after a juggle. Smith kicked the turf in anger, but Webster kicked on and completed a gutsy half-century.

Straightaway after tea, the score at 190 for 6, Temba Bavuma summoned Rabada. Six overs and four balls later, Rabada celebrated his second entry on the Lord’s honours board and South Africa were retreating with happy faces after bowling out their nemesis for 212 runs. To the lower-order batsmen, he swapped subtlety for brutality. Two fierce back-benders nailed Cummins and Starc, after he had Webster edge and slash at a widish ball.

But the total already looks like a mountain to scale as Starc and Co would return to harass the most inexperienced South African batting line-up in recent memory, infusing a cold intrigue to the second day.

Highlights include Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to France to co-chair the AI Action Summit and the visit by the re-elected European Commission President, Ursula Von der Leyen, and the college of commissioners to India in February. The MEA-supported Raisina Dialogue also makes a debut this week in the strategic port city of Marseille.

Europe faces extraordinary challenges. War has returned. Economic difficulties, concerns over security and immigration, and rising issues of identity and culture are reshaping politics. The European Union’s (EU’s) many internal stresses and faultlines have made managing the European project more complex, though Brexit has dissuaded even the most nationalist governments from abandoning the EU.

The external challenges are greater. Europe must contend with US President Donald Trump’s disdain for NATO and near dismantling of long-adrift transatlantic relations, the rupture in relations with Russia, and the geopolitical and economic strain in ties with China. Multilateralism, Europe’s refuge for order and its instrument of international influence, is crumbling. Europe risks strategic irrelevance and a rising gap with the US and China in innovation and competitiveness. The world’s most open major economy faces an upturned global trade regime. And, as it happens in continental landmasses, to Europe’s east, the lines that define the political and cultural geography of what constitutes Europe are perennially contested.

But the EU has shown remarkable cohesion and resilience in its response to Covid, the Ukraine war and Trump’s onslaught. Its project of horizontal and vertical integration continues. Relations with the UK are improving. Europe is waking up to the need for independence in foreign and security policy, the pursuit of industrial and digital sovereignty, a resilient internal supply chain and a stronger defence industrial base. It has the intellectual, industrial and investment capacity for that. But Europe cannot do it by itself. It needs new patterns of alignment. Equally, global uncertainty has reinforced India’s traditional proclivity for a diversified portfolio of partnerships.

Engagement with Europe involves two levels. With the EU in its areas of exclusive and shared competences, there is a long tradition of summits, and now, expansion of strategic dialogues, including in trade, technology, security and foreign policy. With older and major member states, ties are strengthening and acquiring new dimensions. The Nordic region is the new frontier and attention has returned to the dynamic east.

The EU is a leading and growing trade and investment partner for India. According to a Institut Montaigne study on the EU’s ties in the Indo-Pacific, Eurostat data shows that between 2015 and 2022, EU27 FDI stock registered the strongest growth in India at 96 per cent, exceeding Taiwan’s 93 per cent and China’s 52 per cent. From France alone, the FDI stock grew a whopping 373 per cent. In trade, too, between 2015 and 2023, EU27 exports to India grew 47 per cent, behind 83 per cent to Taiwan and 54 per cent to China. EU imports from India grew by over 100 per cent, second behind Taiwan from the Indo-Pacific. Surveys indicate a trend toward diversification away from China, though less than that of US companies.

The EU must conclude the EU-India trade and investment agreements quickly, starting with an early harvest, and also waive the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for India in view of India’s progress in green energy. These will accelerate IMEC, the great new strategic initiative that reprises an old India-Europe corridor, and will survive the current instability in the Middle East. It aims to be not just a trade route but a new global corridor of investment, innovation, enterprise and energy. India must invest more in Europe.

India and Europe converge on the public character and purpose of digital technology and in preventing a global duopoly. As Modi said at the AI Action Summit, we can collaborate in innovation, application, regulation, governance, standards and serving public good globally. That also applies to digital public infrastructure. India can benefit from Europe’s leadership in deeptech, digital manufacturing, enterprise technologies and key areas of the semiconductor chain.

Indeed, science, technology and innovation should drive our partnership — to lead industries of the future and address global priorities, including diverse clean energy sources, climate resilience, health and food security, biodiversity and the sustainability of Earth and its oceans. This also requires a comprehensive mobility programme of higher ambition for students, scholars and scientists.

Europe is a significant source of armaments for India. Europe, seeking to rearm itself, and India pursuing atmanirbharta, must prioritise collaboration and full transfer of technology in joint design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment. We have robust cooperation in the areas of maritime, underwater, space and cyber security, as also in counter-terrorism with many European partners. Beyond technical and intelligence cooperation, Europe, hit by Islamist terrorism, and sometimes with the provenance of Pakistan, needs to do more to penalise Pakistan for terrorism.

Great powers believe they can bend the world to their will but often cause chaos. Middle powers need to leverage partnerships and institutions to resist and maximise their roles. India and the EU have a broader global agenda that rises beyond differences on Ukraine or Pakistan. India and a united, cohesive Europe, with an independent voice and capabilities, can build a stable multipolar world, anchored in international law, underpinned by the discipline of multilateralism and free from territorial ambitions.

India and Europe approach challenges through coalitions, not unilateral initiatives or the use of asymmetric bilateral power. That calls for collaboration, not the EU’s prescriptive approach on its norms. For the Global South, partnerships can protect our interests against mounting competition and also mitigate global fragmentation. In the Indo-Pacific region, while France is a key security partner for India, working with others and the EU, India can help countries avoid coercion by one hegemon or a forced choice between two major powers.

Attention and time, imagination and ambition, and sensitivity to each other’s concerns transform relationships. Europe and India need more of that despite other immediate preoccupations in Brussels, Delhi and European capitals. We must involve all stakeholders and also reshape media stereotypes and public perceptions.

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-govts-revise-gdp-base-year-and-methodology-10060239/,"Dear Readers,

In an interview to The Indian Express, Saurabh Garg, Secretary to Government of India in the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, stated that the ministry is in the process of revising the “base year” for the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The GDP is the central metric to assess the annual economic growth or the overall size of an economy and the so-called “base year” refers to the year that works as a starting point for calculations. At present, the base year is 2011-12. In other words, the GDP in 2011-12 is used as a “base” over which the GDP growth of any following year is calculated. The new base year for GDP calculations will be 2022-23 and the revised series of data will be released on February 27, 2026.

Garg also confirmed that some other key macroeconomic metrics will also undergo changes in base years. The base year for Index of Industrial Production (IIP) will also be revised to 2022-23 while the base year for Consumer Price Index, which is used to assess the rate of inflation faced by consumers, will be revised to 2023-24.

Is this the first time such a revision is happening?

No. The revision slated for 2026 will be the eighth such.

The first set of estimates of national income (GDP) for India was compiled by the “National Income Committee”, under the chairmanship of PC Mahalanobis in 1949. The first and final reports of national income by this committee were brought out in 1951 and 1954 respectively.

Story continues below this ad

Since then, as more and better quality data became available, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) undertook comprehensive reviews of the methodology used for calculating GDP. Apart from shifting base years of national accounts series, the CSO also tried making improvements in the compilation of national accounts series, in terms of coverage of activities, incorporation of latest datasets and latest international guidelines.

The base year of national accounts have been revised on seven different occasions:

From 1948-49 to 1960-61 in August 1967;

From 1960-61 to 1970-71 in January 1978;

From 1970-71 to 1980-81 in February 1988;

From 1980-81 to 1993-94 in February 1999;

From 1993-94 to 1999-2000 in January 2006;

From 1999-2000 to 2004-05 in January 2010; and

From 2004-05 to 2011-12 on January 30, 2015.

It is important to note that revisions in base year and the broader updates in the methodology of estimating the GDP go together.

What is the rationale behind GDP base year revisions?

The short answer is: To more accurately understand and report the state of the economy. An accurate reporting, in turn, is an essential requirement both for policymakers as well as all the other economic agents (from large business firms to budding entrepreneurs).

But calculating or, more accurately, estimating the GDP of a large country such as India is not as straightforward as it may appear at first glance.

The remarkable thing about GDP is that it promises to capture the vast and varied reality of an economy in just one number. Read this piece for a more detailed explainer on GDP. It can be calculated in different ways; say, either by looking at how much people spend or, alternatively, how much they earn. But if one spends some time on the definition of GDP, it will become clear that it is not easy to calculate it.

On paper, GDP measures the current market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year).

Story continues below this ad

The word “final” is crucial, but often receives very little attention. Its implication is that the GDP will only include those goods and services that are bought by the final consumers or users.

For instance, a cricket bat is a final good. But, of course, it is made of many things: the rubber grip, the wood, the adhesives, the labour used to make the bat, etc. Each of these things likely went through its own production process. For instance, the rubber grip on the handle is a finished product in itself that uses other “intermediate” and “primary” (say rubber) products. Same holds true for the wood and how it was cut and sold and processed before it was bought by the cricket bat maker.

The use of the word “final” in the GDP definition means that only the final monetary value (in current day prices) will be used in GDP. That, in turn, means weaning away all the other prices (of intermediate and primary goods and services that went into making the bat) out of the GDP calculations. Even if all the data is available, the complexity of calculations is quite apparent.

However, the fact is, all the required data isn’t always available in the absolute accurate manner.

Moreover, and very importantly, the economy itself undergoes fundamental change as the years roll by.

India started off as a predominantly agrarian economy. That meant most of the people were involved in agriculture or related activities and most of the GDP came from those activities. With each passing decade, India’s economic structure has changed. Today, most of the GDP (around 55%) comes from the so-called “services” sector while agriculture etc. contribute less than 20%. However, the number of people involved in agriculture has not fallen in the commensurate manner. Estimating GDP from the farm and estimating from the services sector requires different data sets and different methodologies.

Further, these methodologies also change with the improvements in data as well as understanding of the linkages in the economy. For instance, it is noteworthy that up until 1999, India saw the GDP series being revised once in a decade, changing the base to a year that ended with 1.

This was no coincidence.

The informal (or unorganised) sector playing a major role in the Indian economy and the workforce estimates for the unorganised sector were obtained from the Population Census conducted decennially in the years ending with 1. As such, it was natural to make such years the base years for each revision.

Story continues below this ad

However, since the 1993-94 series, the CSO started using the work force estimates from the results of Employment and Unemployment Surveys of National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), which are conducted once in every five years.

As a result, since 1999, the base year has been changed every five years (until 2015). This practice was also in line with the recommendation of the National Statistical Commission that all economic indices should be “rebased” at least once in every five years.

How do regular revisions of base year and methodology help?

Regular revisions in base years help in two broad ways.

One, they capture the changes in the way India’s economy functions — new industries can be included and outdated ones removed from the calculations.

Story continues below this ad

Two, they provide a more accurate picture of the “real” economic growth, which is the economic growth after removing the effect of inflation. For argument’s sake, an economy’s GDP could double in a year in two very contrasting ways: The total output remains the same but the prices double or the prices remain the same and the “real” output (say cars manufactured inside the country) doubles. The reality lies somewhere in the middle and revising the base year provides a more accurate understanding of how the real economy is growing.

Why was the base year not changed five years after 2011-12?

The fact is that the government led by Prime Minister Modi had announced in 2017 that a new GDP series will be released with 2017-18 as the new base year. The government had hoped to use the results of Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) as well as the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS was an annual survey replacing the quinquennial Employment-Unemployment Surveys), both of which were slated in 2017-18, to update the GDP data.

However, both the surveys ran into trouble with the government itself raising data quality issues. The PLFS for 2017-18 had shown that the unemployment rate had risen to a 45-year high and the CES for 2017-18 showed that poverty had risen (as evidenced by a fall in spending) since 2011-12, a historic reversal of trend. Although after the election results of 2019, the government accepted PLFS findings, the CES results were never accepted.

Story continues below this ad

Eventually, these data gaps led to the government dropping 2017-18 as the new base year because it wasn’t “normal”. It must be noted that 2017-18 experienced the ramifications of key policy led-disruptions such as the government’s decision to overnight demonetise 86% of India’s currency base in November 2016 as well as the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax regime (replacing multiple indirect taxes) in July 2017. India’s GDP growth rate registered a sharp deceleration starting 2017-18, falling from more than 8% in 2016-17 to less than 4% in 2019-20.

Since the start of 2020, the Covid pandemic-induced disruptions have meant that neither 2020 nor the years immediately after it could be treated as “normal” years.

Why is this particular revision crucial for India’s global standing?

Although it is true that each revision improved the estimation of India’s GDP, yet the last revision in 2015 created a lot of controversy that dented India’s global standing. In particular, many experts claimed that the methodological changes incorporated in 2015 meant that India was overestimating (i.e. overstating) its GDP.

These dissenting voices even included the government’s own Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, who questioned the credibility of India’s GDP soon after he left office. Read this piece to understand the whole controversy better.

Experts such as Prof R Nagaraj, formerly associated with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research and now with IIT Bombay, have repeatedly written that the methodological changes in 2015 overstate India’s GDP.

In a 2021 paper published in the Economic and Political Weekly, Nagaraj found that the growth rates in the manufacturing sector are far more muted if one looks at the Annual Survey of Industries data (published by MoSPI) as against the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ MCA-21 database for the Private Corporate Sector (PCS) that is used in GDP calculations.

The new base year revision and the new GDP series will be coming out after India has already missed a cycle of revisions in 2017-18, which, in turn, implies that some inaccuracies may have crept in GDP estimation.

Moreover, over the past decade, thanks to the controversies surrounding the PLFS and CES data as well as long-standing gaps in poverty and inequality data, not to mention the absence of Census data, the credibility of India’s macroeconomic data as well as the government’s claims have been increasingly questioned.

The new series will also come at a time when India will be on the verge of becoming the third-largest economy after the US and China (in nominal GDP terms). That, in turn, means global investors and analysts are likely to scrutinise the results very carefully.

Accuracy of the new series will be central not just for the fortunes of billions of dollars of investor money but also for the credibility of India’s data and its usefulness for domestic policymaking.

Do you trust India’s GDP data? If not, what can the government do to improve the credibility of its GDP data?

Last month, at Google’s developer conference, Project Starline was rebranded as Google Beam. Now, Google is turning its sci-fi technology into a commercial product, with HP becoming the first company to launch a Beam device. However, the price is an eye-watering $25,000.

Called HP Dimension, the device is an AI-powered communications solution that makes video calls feel more three-dimensional and lifelike. The system uses a light field display that creates a visual depth effect of the person on the call, and it integrates six cameras into three surrounding bezels for head tracking — essentially becoming a 3D, glasses-free TV. HP says the special light field display renders participants realistically in terms of size, depth, colour, and even eye contact.

AI is used to merge multiple 2D video streams of a person into a “3D light field with perfect tracking.”

HP Dimension with Google Beam aims to address a major challenge in many workplaces: staying connected in remote settings. HP shares that 73 percent of knowledge workers report wanting to feel more connected to their coworkers.

According to internal testing, HP Dimension with Google Beam has effectively addressed workers’ connectivity concerns — showing a 28 per cent increase in memory recall, a 29 per cent rise in non-verbal behaviors displayed, and at least a 14 per cent increase in focus on meeting partners.

The HP-made Beam model features a large 65-inch display, but eventually, Beam systems will be offered in multiple screen sizes. Google says it is working with companies like Zoom, and organizations including Citadel, Deloitte, Duolingo, Hackensack Meridian Health, NEC, Recruit, and Salesforce have expressed interest and plan to bring the technology to their teams.

At last year’s Google I/O, in a rare opportunity, The Indian Express’ Anuj Bhatia tried Google Beam (then still called Project Starline). Here’s an excerpt from his hands-on experience with the 3D video calling booth.

“As I walked into the Project Starline demo room, I met Andrew Nartker, General Manager, Google, who has been the lead on this project. Nartker asked me to take a seat, assuring me that he would join me on a call in seconds. I couldn’t understand what he meant by that, but I complied. I took the seat, and the screen in front of me lit up, revealing Nartker. He greeted me as if we were meeting face-to-face for the first time in a normal meeting. Within the next few minutes, I completely forgot I had just met Nartker. However, Nartker had gone to the other room and was being projected in front of me through Google’s Project Starline.”",Technology
https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/chess/rani-hamid-bangladesh-oldest-active-im-delhi-open-10061253/,"The 81-year-old looked shattered when she lost a first-round game to 12-year-old Paras Kalia during the 21st Delhi International Chess Open.

Her shawl slipped from her hands as she signed the scoresheet, exchanged copies, and handed one to the arbiter. It was Bangladesh’s Sayeda Jasimunnessa Khatun, better known as Rani Hamid — the oldest active Women’s International Master — who had just lost. When Paras returned to collect his scoresheet, the octogenarian and the preteen spent 20 minutes analysing the endgame.

Hamid remained quiet, exhausted and perhaps unsettled by losing to a child younger than her grandson.

“How can I be happy with this?” she says with a grin. I’m getting old now. I should have found the draw with my knight,” Rani tells The Indian Express.

The 20-time National Women’s Champion of Bangladesh, Rani was born in British India in 1944. It wasn’t until 1979 — when the Bangladesh Chess Federation (BCF) joined the International Chess Federation (FIDE) — that she could formally play the sport she was “attracted to.” By then 35, Rani had seen her world transform — from British India to East Pakistan to independent Bangladesh after the 1971 war, and her being the mother of four children.

As an energetic child, Rani discovered what would become her lifelong passion. “There was no chess culture as such. I didn’t even play. But I had so much energy, always running around, never sitting quietly as a child. That changed when I noticed my father playing chess with friends. It somehow attracted me, and I would sit quietly watching them. It felt meant for me, even though chess barely existed in East Pakistan — not for the public, not even in schools,” she recalls.

For women, the game was practically non-existent in Bangladesh post the ’71 war. That changed when she married MA Hamid, a progressive lieutenant colonel in the Bangladesh Army and a sports fanatic himself. A boxer, swimmer, cricketer and footballer, Hamid would go on to establish the Bangladesh Handball Federation and chair the National Sports Council.

“My husband knew I was mad about chess,” Rani remembers. He knew if I heard chess being played, I’d rush to join. He saw a newspaper advertisement and asked me, ‘There’s this tournament happening – you want to play?… Be ready for it.’ I was nervous at first. I didn’t even know you had to study chess, that there were books for it. All I knew was that I wanted to play,” she says.

“I was actually lucky that I became the champion in the first tournament I played,” she adds.

Rani’s success was aided by former Pakistan zonal champion Dr Akmal Hussain. “He turned out to be my neighbour, and I practiced with him to improve. Later, I won the same tournament nine more times. Until everyone grew tired of seeing the same name,” she adds with a laugh. “Then my husband suggested I write a book to inspire young Bangladeshi girls to take up chess.”

Rani authored a book titled “Mojar Khela Daba”, which literally translates to “Fun Game Chess.”

Three pillars

She could speak endlessly about three pivotal figures in her life: her father, her husband, and her eldest son. Her father introduced her to chess, her husband encouraged her to pursue it professionally, and her son Kaiser Hamid carved his own legacy in a different sport.

Kaiser, a central defender for Kolkata’s Mohammedan Sporting Club, captained the Bangladesh national team for years. “He was very popular in Bangladesh. In fact, he remains highly regarded, people thought the world of my son,” says the proud mother.

She speaks equally fondly of her father: “My father was champion in his college days… swimming, tennis, badminton.”

Nor does she miss praising her husband: “He excelled in all outdoor sports. He held boxing records in Pakistan, and his swimming record stood for years in both Pakistan and Bangladesh.”

Rani has represented Bangladesh in every Chess Olympiad since 1984, including three participations in the Open section (competing alongside male players). She even won the British Women’s Championship three times before the event stopped allowing foreign players.

But now, her age is catching up with her skills. Disappointed with her recent performances, Rani stands 407th in a field of 443 players, having secured just one win and a draw in seven rounds. Ahead of her Wednesday game, the combined age of her opponents — all Indians under 18 — totals three years less than her own age.

Friend blacklisted

Much of this struggle can be traced to a “distressing” incident at New Delhi airport that left her “shaken,” as she described it. Her companion Ashiya Sultana was denied entry and deported due to a previous visa violation for having played a tournament in Kolkata when in the country on a medical visa.

When asked if she would continue playing chess, Rani replies, “What do I have apart from this? I’m alone without chess.”",Sports

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-introduces-v-jepa-2-an-ai-world-model-to-power-robotics-and-autonomous-systems-10061628/,"It seems the AI community is gearing up for the next frontier in AI, world models. Meta, on Wednesday, June 11, unveiled its new AI model, V-JEPA 2. Dubbed as a ‘world model’, the V-JEPA 2 has the ability to understand the physical world. The model has been designed to comprehend movements of objects and has the potential to enhance robotics and self-driving cars.

The V-JEPA 2 is an open-source AI model that can understand and predict real-world environments in 3D. It allows AI to build an internal simulation of the real world, essentially helping it reason, plan, and act much like humans. While a traditional AI model would rely heavily on labelled data, the V-JEPA 2 is reportedly trained to identify patterns in unlabelled video clips, using these as its foundation for internal 3D reasoning.

The world model highlights the tech giant’s increasing focus towards more intuitive and intelligent AI systems that can engage with the physical world. Reportedly, this technology can be beneficial in the domains of robotics, augmented reality, and future AI assistants.

“Today, we’re excited to share V-JEPA 2, the first world model trained on video that enables state-of-the-art understanding and prediction, as well as zero-shot planning and robot control in new environments. As we work toward our goal of achieving advanced machine intelligence (AMI), it will be important that we have AI systems that can learn about the world as humans do, plan how to execute unfamiliar tasks, and efficiently adapt to the ever-changing world around us,” Meta wrote in its official blog.

The latest announcement from Meta comes at a time when the company is facing stiff competition from rivals Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. According to a recent CNBC report, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority for the company, which is also planning to invest $14 billion in Scale AI, a company that pioneers data labelling for AI training.

When it comes to the specifications, the V-JEPA 2 is a 1.2 billion-parameter model that has been built using the Meta Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) model which was shared in 2022. V-JEPA is Meta’s first model trained on video that was released in 2024, with the latest V-JEPA 2 the company claims to have improved action prediction and world modelling capabilities which allows robots to interact with unfamiliar objects and environments to accomplish a task.

What are world models?

In simple words, world models are mental simulations that help us in predicting how the physical world behaves. We humans develop this intuition right from a young age, such as we know instinctively that a ball thrown in the air will fall back down. Similarly, while walking in a crowded space we avoid colliding with others. This inner sense of cause and effect helps us to act more effectively in complex situations.

When it comes to AI agents, they need similar capabilities to interact with the real world. Accordion to Meta, to achieve this their world models should be capable of understanding their surroundings and recognise objects, actions, and movements; they should be able to predict how things will change over time, especially in response to actions; they should plan ahead by simulating possible outcomes and choosing the best course of action.

So to simplify, an AI world model is an internal simulation that helps a machine to understand, predict, and plan within a physical environment. Essentially, it helps the AI to anticipate how the world will change in response to actions. Now, this could enable more intelligent, goal-driven behavior in AI.

What can V-JEPA 2 do?

The V-JEPA 2 model could likely enhance real-world machines like self-driving cars and robots. For instance, self-driving cars would need to understand their surroundings in real time to move about safely. While most AI models depend on massive amounts of labelled data or video footage, V-JEPA 2 reportedly uses something known as simplified ‘latent’ space to reason about how an object moves or interacts.

According to Meta’s Chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, a world model is an ‘abstract digital twin of reality’ that allows AI to predict what will happen next and plan accordingly. It is a big leap towards making AI more useful in the physical world. In one of his recent presentations, LeCun stated that helping machines understand the physical world is different from teaching them language.

In a now-viral LinkedIn post, Bhatt recounted how a simple order on Zomato quickly transformed his evening. “Yesterday I ordered ice cream from Zomato,” he wrote. About 15 minutes later, he got a call from the delivery partner: “Sir, aap neeche aa sakte ho?” (Sir, can you please come downstairs?)

Bundled in a blanket, Bhatt casually replied: “Kyun bhai? Aap aa jaao na upar.” (Why, brother? Come upstairs?)

“Sir, main handicapped hoon.” (Sir, I am a person with a disability.)

“Sudden silence. Guilt came in faster than the delivery,” Bhatt wrote in the post. Tossing aside his blanket “like the main character in a movie,” he rushed downstairs, humbled by the moment.

“We keep cribbing about late deliveries, melted food, and ‘packaging achhi nahi di’ – but in the background, companies like Zomato are giving real opportunities to people who actually need them,” he wrote. “I just found something that made me feel both human and humbled.”

Bhatt ended the post on a light-hearted note, sharing a screenshot of his three-ice-cream order: “And yes, the ice cream was worth it. Next time your delivery partner calls, maybe don’t be wrapped in your blanket like some paneer roll.”

The post struck a deep chord online. One user responded with warmth and wit: “From paneer roll to superhero sprint! Love this heartwarming moment and Zomato’s efforts. May they keep surprising us (and delivering smiles)! Also now craving paneer rolls and ice cream. Thanks for that!”

Another user suggested a solution to avoid such awkward moments in the future: “Why don’t you add a tag or a notification to let the customer know that a differently abled/your super delivery partner is on his way? Just to avoid this awkward situation!”

Bhatt’s story also opened the floodgates for others to share similar experiences. One user recalled, “Something very similar happened to me as well. I asked the guy to come to the second floor. The building didn’t have a lift. It was 7 in the morning. He told me it would take him a few minutes. When he rang the bell, I saw that he had polio and one of his legs barely worked. Been four years, and I still can’t get over the guilt.”

Another shared a similar story: “Had a similar experience once in Gurgaon. I asked the delivery guy to come up to the second floor – there was no lift. He didn’t say a word, just came up after quite a while. When I opened the door, I was taken aback – he was really old, like really old. I offered him a chair and some water, then gently asked why he was doing this kind of work. He said it was actually his son’s account. His son had met with an accident while rushing deliveries – this was during the whole ‘10-minute delivery’ craze. In his words, ‘Duniya ko aag lagi hai.’ So now, the father was delivering orders to keep the family going until his son recovered. This is more than three years ago, and I still can’t forget his words and expressions.”",Entertainment
https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/cost-of-raising-children-urban-india-education-expenses-10060913/,"Raising children has never been cheap, but in urban India today, the cost is becoming a financial mountain few feel fully prepared for.

Raising children has never been easy on the wallet, but in urban India today, it’s becoming a financial mountain. People often assume child-free couples are loaded with disposable income, but the truth is, many of them choose not to have kids because they simply can’t afford to. Of course, not always, but often enough.

A recent LinkedIn post by Mumbai-based professional Ankur Jhaveri has reignited the conversation about just how expensive parenthood can be. His calculation, based on a chat with his cousin – a teacher at an international school – offered a glimpse into the staggering numbers involved.

Story continues below this ad

“I never realised the real cost of raising kids in India, until I met my cousin last week, who is a teacher at an international school,” Jhaveri wrote.

According to his breakdown, just the tuition fee at a reputed international school could set parents back by anywhere between Rs 7 to Rs 9 lakh a year. And that’s before you even get to the “extras” – uniforms, books, and tuition classes, which could easily push the annual education cost to around Rs 12 lakh.

But education is only part of the story. Jhaveri said, “Now, add to it some additional coaching/extra-curricular activities, clothes, birthday parties, leisure expenses, etc., at Rs 8000-10,000/month (Rs 1 lakh a year).” Altogether, he estimated the yearly spend at roughly Rs 13 lakh per child.

What does that translate to in terms of income? “Assuming you would spend about 30% of your income on your kids – this means your net salary should be about Rs 43-44 lakhs,” he calculated. “The fun part is still left – Income Tax! Assuming you pay 20% of your salary as tax (blended), this means your gross salary, to afford this lifestyle for your kids, should be about Rs 55 lakhs.”

See the post:

It doesn’t end there. “This is if you have ONE kid,” Jhaveri pointed out. “Have another one, and these numbers increase substantially.”

Of course, Jhaveri made it clear that his math isn’t flawless: “Those of you who actually have kids, please tell me what else I’m missing (I’m sure there’s something).”

Predictably, the post set off a lively debate. Some parents nodded in agreement, saying his numbers weren’t far off from reality. Others argued that such expenses only applied to those aiming for premium education in metro cities. Anticipating this, Jhaveri noted, “Some folks are commenting, saying ICSE schools charge less. My point here is two-fold: 1) Most parents (at least here on LinkedIn) would want the best education for their kids… 2) The best ICSE schools (the legacy ones) are extremely tough to get into.”

Responding to the post, a user commented, “I would tag these schools as “branded” schools. My school fees was less than Rs 15k a year, i believe it has not touched the lakh figure yet So choosing good school vs branded one is more important.”

Another user shared a different perspective, “This is present cost. What about future cost of any professional degree or course especially if planning abroad. It will be same amount needed 10 yrs down the line to be saved every yr from now to cover up including future cost of education. Which effective means if we are not having double income group in any metro cities then it’s a definite case of zero savings during retirement.”

A third person wrote, “I am shortlisting schools……and you get decent one’s within lakh to 1.5/yr all inclusive. Now i am not saying this is less, but then your calculation is factoring fees of dhurubhai ambani school …..which shouldn’t be the case.”",World

https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravi-shastri-virat-kohli-retirement-captain-after-australia-10061372/,"Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has said that if he had anything to do with the decision-making process, he would have handed over the Test captaincy to Virat Kohli immediately after the Australia series ended earlier this year.

The captaincy of the Indian men’s test team has been a talking point recently after the retirement of Rohit Sharma in the middle of the Indian Premier League season, after it emerged that the selectors were looking to move on from the veteran opening batter for the five-match series coming up in England. Rohit had earlier stood down from the role ahead of the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, citing his own poor form. Then Kohli too announced his retirement from the red-ball format. The BCCI then handed over the reins of the Test team to Shubman Gill.

Ravi Shastri, who had multiple stints in India’s dressing room but most crucially as the head coach from 2017-2021 when Kohli was the captain, said that that his retirement could have been handled better. “It’s when you go then, that’s when people will realize how big a player he was. I feel sad that he is gone and the way he is gone,” Shastri is quoted as saying by Sony Sports in a promo video for a docu-series released on Wednesday. “I think it could have been handled better. There should have been more communication. If I had anything to do with it, I would have made him captain straightaway after Australia,” the former India captain added.

Kohli ended his test career with 9230 runs in 123 matches with an average of 46.85 and 30 centuries. His form too had tapered off in Australia, after starting the series with a century in Perth as India took a 1-0 lead under Jasprit Bumrah’s captaincy. Kohli struggled in the channel outside stump, repeatedly edging behind the stumps. But since he retired, there have been calls for him reconsider his decision, while he has also been hailed for making Test cricket a priority right through his career.

“Stats don’t do justice. The way he was an ambassador for Test cricket, especially the way he played overseas. I am glad, I was part of it,” Shastri added further.

Chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar had said, while announcing the Test squad for England, that Kohli reached out in April to inform the BCCI that he was done with Test cricket. “Virat reached out early April and said he wants to finish,” Agarkar said. “We’ve seen him give 200% to every ball that he plays, even when he is not batting or he’s in the field. He probably felt that he had given everything that he had and if he can’t keep up to the standards that he set for himself over the years, and how good he has been, and maybe it was time for him. It has come from him. You’ve got to respect that.”

According to the data, the PM10 levels breached the standards of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on these 49 days.

Records showed that the highest brunt was faced by Deonar, Bandra Kurla Complex and Chakala in Andheri East, where the monthly average of PM10 exceeded the safe standard consistently during the three-month period.

The data, analysed by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and released on Wednesday, showed that the monthly average of PM10 — a particulate matter that is 10 micrometres or smaller —remained high between February and March, while a small improvement was observed in April.

According to the CPCB standards, 100 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is considered the normal standard measurement for PM 10.

However, in February, the average PM10 levels in Mumbai touched 130 µg/m3, while in March, the average touched 108 µg/m3.

According to the data, while the PM10 levels remained high on all 28 monitored days in February. In March, the average PM10 levels breached the standard mark on at least 17 of 31 days. April, however, fared better with the PM10 levels breaching the normal levels on only four out of 30 days, with the average PM10 level hovering around 78 µg/m3.

During the three-month period analysed, it was observed that Deonar was among the worst hit pockets with the average PM10 crossing 225 micrograms per cubic metre in February.

PM 10 is harmful to health because they are easily inhalable, due to being tiny, and can settle in the lungs. Besides triggering respiratory and cardiovascular problems, these particles are detrimental, particularly for persons ailing with asthma, as well as children and the elderly.

In Mumbai, emissions from the combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood produce much of the PM2.5 pollution found in outdoor air, as well as a significant proportion of PM10.

PM10 also includes dust from construction sites, landfills and waste burning, industrial sources, wind-blown dust from open lands, pollen and fragments of bacteria.

A felicitation for the IPL-winning RCB team was conducted from 4 pm to 5 pm on the steps of the Vidhana Soudha, with Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar and several members of the Congress cabinet in attendance.

A celebration was also held between 5 pm and 6 pm at the Chinnaswamy cricket stadium, where RCB fans had been gathering in thousands from 1 pm to gain entry to what was advertised by the team as a free event.

The stampede occurred around the 21 gates surrounding the stadium as fans tried to force their way in while security personnel at the stadium tried to keep the gates closed. No deaths were reported in the vicinity of the venue at the Vidhana Soudha, held 1 km away from the stadium.

Advocate-General K M Shashi Kiran Shetty told the Karnataka High Court last week–during the hearing of a suo motu petition–that “four deaths were recorded of fans from Gate 7, one from Gate 1, two from Gate 2 and four from Gates 17 to 21”.

The state government has argued that the gathering of nearly three lakh RCB fans–at the prompting of messages posted on social media by the team for its fan base of over three crores, to gather to celebrate the June 3 IPL victory without any police clearances for the event–had overwhelmed the police and security personnel outside the stadium, which only has a capacity of 33,000.

The Karnataka government is due to file a report in a sealed cover on the findings on the stampede deaths on Thursday before the high court.

The recording of the 11 deaths

Information gathered from multiple sources, on the recording of the stampede deaths by three hospitals and the subsequent movement to mortuaries, reveals that the first death was recorded at 3.45 pm, at Vydehi Superspeciality Hospital, of Prajwal G, 22, an engineering graduate and an employee at a private firm.

The second death was recorded at 4.15 pm, at Bowring Hospital, of Divyanshi B S, 14, a Class 9 student; the third was recorded at 4.27 pm, at Bowring Hospital, of Manoj Kumar N D, 19, a college student; the fourth was recorded at 4.34 pm, at Vydehi Hospital, of Poornachandra C, 20, a civil engineer; the fifth at 4.40 pm, at Bowring Hospital, of Kamakshi Devi S, 29, an Amazon employee.

The next five deaths were recorded in the 30 minutes from 4.45 pm to 5.15 pm–with the death of Bhumik L, a 19-year-old student, recorded at Vydehi Hospital at 4.45 pm; of Chinmayi Shetty, also a 19-year-old student, recorded at Manipal (Vikram) Hospital around 5 pm; of Sahana Rajesh, 23, a Bosch employee, recorded at Vydehi Hospital at 5.07 pm; of Shivalingu C, 17, a student, recorded at Bowring Hospital, also at 5.07 pm; of Shravan K T, 20, a student, recorded at Bowring Hospital at 5.10 pm; and Akshata Pai, 26, a chartered accountant at Bowring Hospital at 5.15 pm.

The postmortems of five victims were conducted at Victoria Hospital and six postmortems were conducted at Bowring Hospital. The first postmortem took place at 8 pm at Bowring Hospital and the last at 11.40 pm at Victoria Hospital. A postmortem can take place only after a near relative identifies the body.

Although the first death declared in the stampede was that of Prajwal G, 22, at Vydehi Hospital at 3.45 pm, his postmortem was conducted only at 11.40 pm as his body was identified late by his family, before it was moved to Victoria Hospital for the procedure.

“The last postmortem at Bowring Hospital was conducted at 11.20 pm because the parents of the victim (Kamakshi Devi) had to come from Salem for the identification,” a source said.

‘Siddaramiah informed of the first death late’

The Opposition parties in Karnataka have accused the Congress government of going on with the victory felicitation and celebrations, at the Vidhana Soudha and the Chinnaswamy stadium, respectively, on the evening of June 4 despite the deaths of fans being registered at hospitals ahead of the first event and through the course of the first and second events.

Sources in the government said that one of the primary reasons Siddaramaiah decided on June 5 to suspend five police officers, including the then Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda, was the fact that the news of the deaths outside the stadium was not brought to his notice.

“If the news of the first death had been communicated to the CM, the programme at the Vidhana Soudha and the stadium could have been cancelled, leading to fewer deaths. The CM was livid that he was not informed of the stampede incidents,” a government source said.

The “situation was not discussed with the higher-ups for taking necessary guidance and advice in the matter. As a result, the situation went out of control and brought a lot of misery, loss of precious life and embarrassment to the government,” says the suspension orders for the police officers.

“Although the injured were admitted to the hospital at 3.50 pm, I received information at 5.45 pm that a stampede had occurred near the stadium and people had died. The stampede incident should not have happened. It is very saddening,” Siddaramaiah said last week.

“The first death due to the stampede occurred at 3.10 pm. But D K Shivakumar was seen kissing the cup at the stadium. Meanwhile, CM Siddaramaiah took his grandson to Janardhan Hotel to eat masala dosa and halwa,” Union minister H D Kumaraswamy said last week.

Political row

Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka claimed that “the police had informed them of the first death by noon”. “Eight children had already died when the event began, yet the programme continued, showing that these leaders have hearts of stone,” the BJP MLA alleged.

D K Shivakumar, who participated in the events at the Vidhana Soudha and the Chinnaswamy stadium, said that he had directed the ending of the stadium felicitation as soon as he learned of the stampede deaths.

“The police commissioner told the organisers to cut the programme down to 10 minutes. We also spoke to the RCB management to cut the programme short. My media friends informed me about the stampede. The police commissioner too spoke to me,” the deputy chief minister said.",Sports

Days after US President Donald Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, hundreds of US Marines are getting ready to enter the city where protests have erupted against immigration raids by the federal administration. The Marines, who are one of the six armed forces of the country, were undergoing refresher training in riot and crowd control on Wednesday. They are understood to be deployed to assist in protecting federal property and immigration enforcement personnel. This news came even as cities across the US braced for fresh immigration protests on Wednesday ahead of planned anti-Trump demonstrations across the country on Saturday.

The sixth seed Gupta employed a free-flowing Ragozin Defense in their Queen’s Gambit Declined game, gaining a significant time advantage early on with white pieces. By the 21st move, Gupta had 35 minutes remaining compared to Gharibyan’s 23 minutes. The Indian grandmaster utilised both his time advantage and space on the board to pressure his opponent. By the 36th move, Gharibyan was down to just 21 seconds on his clock. Despite a stubborn defence, Gharibyan resigned on the 71st move after Gupta cornered his king.

With this win, Gupta moved to 6.5 points after seven rounds. He is now followed by eight players tied for second place at 6.0 points, including top seed SL Narayanan and Georgia’s Levan Pantsulaia, the highest-rated overseas player.

Narayanan, after starting his campaign with a spotless five out of five wins, drew his sixth round against Gupta on Tuesday and had a similar result on Wednesday against Russian GM Boris Savchenko. With a clear motive of a safe draw against Savchenko, Narayanan didn’t waste any energy and convinced his opponent to a three-fold repetition just by the 19th move.

Narayanan had 1 hour and 28 minutes on his clock at the final position. Two other Indians, IM Neelesh Saha and Aronyak Ghosh also find themselves on 6.0 points from seven rounds.

The second seed Diptayan Ghosh slipped to 11th position after his third straight draw of the event. In his seventh-round match against Russia’s Aleksej Aleksandrov, he mutually agreed to end the game, sharing the spoils in what was already a drawish position. He is on 5.5/7.

Among the top five boards, only one other match produced a decisive result, with Swedish GM Vitaly Sivuk defeating India’s untitled Alekhya Mukhopadhyay while playing white.

Los Angeles Protests Highlights: Donald Trump’s administration is ‘not scared to go further’ according to one official as Defence Secretary Pete Hegsmith warns that increasing government intervention should set a precedent for federal responses in other states.

Trump vs Newsom: After President Donald Trump deployed 4,000 national Guard troops and about 700 Marines in Los Angeles to protect federal properties and law enforcement officials and maintain law and order, California Governor Gavin Newsom moved the court to immediately restrain the Trump administration from the deployment. Trump said he spoke with Newsom over the weekend however, in a post on X, Newsom denied receiving the call.When asked if he would consider arresting Newsom, Trump responded, “Well, he’s not doing a good job—you know, arrest, what does that mean?”

National Guard & Marines in LA: Reports suggest 4,000 National Guards have been deployed by the Trump administration in Los Angeles, and a US official said that there were approximately 2,100 National Guard troops in the Greater Los Angeles area on Tuesday. The Pentagon also deployed 700 Marines in LA downtown. The deployment of Marines in LA would be the first instance when the troops be mobilised inside the United States to respond to a civil unrest in over three decades. Trump said he feels more confident in deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles during his second term—something he might have hesitated to do in his first.

After returning, every member went live on Weverse to greet fans and interact, as HYBE had earlier restricted ARMY from visiting the military bases at Chuncheon and Yeoncheon during their farewell events. The group’s leader, Kim Namjoon, and Taehyung, who enlisted together, were the first to go live, where they opened up about their 18 months of mandatory service and even revealed how their MBTI types — a test to identify personality type — shifted over time.

RM admitted he was diagnosed with insomnia and broke down crying the night before his discharge, sparking concern among fans that his military life may not have been as smooth as some of the other members. Meanwhile, fans noticed a drastic change in Taehyung, once known as the most playful, always grabbing attention for his childish antics, now looking much more mature. His posture, his tone, even the way he walks, everything sparked buzz as soon as he returned. And during the Weverse live, he made it clear: those childish days are behind him now.

When RM asked V if his personality had changed, the Winter Bear crooner said yes. He admitted that over time, his The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (personality assessment tool) shifted from “Feelings” to “Thinking” — now seeing himself as more logical. “My MBTI was ENFP (Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Perceiving) or INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Perceiving) but I am ENTP (Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Perceiving) now,” he said. RM followed up, “Why are you T?” With a dead-serious face, Taehyung replied, “I really can’t stand people with childish behavior now. For real!” While RM burst into laughter, V didn’t even flinch and added, “that’s true”. The K-pop idol served in South Korea’s elite SDT counter-terrorism unit, the only BTS member to enlist in the most fierce unit. During his service, Taehyung kept a low profile on social media, rarely making public appearances, though he occasionally grabbed attention for his noticeable weight gain.

Taehyung even recalled weighing nearly 80 kg while serving. Before enlisting, he had shared his goal of hitting 86 kg during his military stint since he wouldn’t have to follow K-pop’s harsh dieting rules and could focus on staying healthy for service. When a fan once asked if he reached that goal, Taehyung proudly said yes, revealing he peaked at 81 kg. But upon discharge, he shared that he’s now back down to 61 kg after shedding the extra weight. “I really wanted to look good for ARMYs, so I completely cut out carbs lately since they can cause bloating. I’ve been waking up at 5 a.m. to work out on my own, just to get rid of the puffiness! It’s been a while since ARMYs last saw me,” he said. Though he’s now back to his original weight and his usual music grind, many fans pointed out how genuinely happy he seemed when he had gained the weight. One fan even commented, “Something about Taehyung saying he lost weight but he really did love his body when it was at 80 kg just sits right in my spirit. Like, I’m so glad those stupid Korean idol beauty standards never made him feel bad about how he looks.”

https://indianexpress.com/article/world/pakistan-foreigner-crackdown-afghans-scrambling-10062041/,"The order was clear and indisputable, the timeline startling. You have 45 minutes to pack up and leave Pakistan forever. Sher Khan, a 42-year-old Afghan, had returned home from his job in a brick factory. He stared at the plainclothes policeman on the doorstep, his mind reeling. How could he pack up his whole life and leave the country of his birth in under an hour? In the blink of an eye, the life he had built was taken away from him. He and his wife grabbed a few kitchen items and whatever clothes they could for themselves and their nine children. They left everything else behind at their home in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.Born in Pakistan to parents who fled the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing war, Khan is one of hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have now been expelled.

The nationwide crackdown, launched in October 2023, on foreigners Pakistan says are living in the country illegally has led to the departures of almost 1 million Afghans already. Pakistan says millions more remain. It wants them gone. Leaving with nothing to beat a deadline

“All our belongings were left behind,” Khan said as he stood in a dusty, windswept refugee camp just across the Afghan border in Torkham, the first stop for expelled refugees. “We tried so hard (over the years) to collect the things that we had with honor.”

Pakistan set several deadlines earlier this year for Afghans to leave or face deportation. Afghan Citizen Card holders had to leave the capital Islamabad and Rawalpindi city by March 31, while those with Proof of Registration could stay until June 30. No specific deadlines were set for Afghans living elsewhere in Pakistan.

Khan feared that delaying his departure beyond the deadline might have resulted in his wife and children being hauled off to a police station along with him a blow to his family’s dignity.“We are happy that we came (to Afghanistan) with modesty and honor,” he said. As for his lost belongings, “God may provide for them here, as He did there.”

A refugee influx in a struggling country At the Torkham camp, run by Afghanistan’s Taliban government, each family receives a SIM card and 10,000 Afghanis ($145) in aid. They can spend up to three days there before having to move on.The camp’s director, Molvi Hashim Maiwandwal, said some 150 families were arriving daily from Pakistan — far fewer than the roughly 1,200 families who were arriving about two months ago. But he said another surge was expected after the three-day Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha that started June 7. Aid organizations inside the camp help with basic needs, including healthcare. Local charity Aseel provides hygiene kits and helps with food. It has also set up a food package delivery system for families once they arrive at their final destination elsewhere in Afghanistan. Aseel’s Najibullah Ghiasi said they expected a surge in arrivals “by a significant number” after Eid. “We cannot handle all of them, because the number is so huge,” he said, adding the organization was trying to boost fundraising so it could support more people.

Pakistan blames Afghanistan for militancy Pakistan accuses Afghans of staging militant attacks inside the country, saying assaults are planned from across the border — a charge Kabul’s Taliban government denies. Pakistan denies targeting Afghans, and maintains that everyone leaving the country is treated humanely and with dignity. But for many, there is little that is humane about being forced to pack up and leave in minutes or hours.

Iran, too, has been expelling Afghans, with the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, saying on June 5 that 500,000 Afghans had been forced to leave Iran and Pakistan in the two months since April 1. Rights groups and aid agencies say authorities are pressuring Afghans into going sooner.

In April, Human Rights Watch said police had raided houses, beaten and arbitrarily detained people, and confiscated refugee documents, including residence permits. Officers demanded bribes to allow Afghans to remain in Pakistan, the group added.

Searching for hope while starting again Fifty-year-old Yar Mohammad lived in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir for nearly 45 years. The father of 12 built a successful business polishing floors, hiring several workers. Plainclothes policemen knocked on his door too. They gave him six hours to leave.“No way a person can wrap up so much business in six hours, especially if they spent 45 years in one place,” he said. Friends rushed to his aid to help pack up anything they could: the company’s floor-polishing machines, some tables, bed-frames and mattresses, and clothes. Now all his household belongings are crammed into orange tents in the Torkham refugee camp, his hard-earned floor-polishing machines outside and exposed to the elements. After three days of searching, he managed to find a place to rent in Kabul. “I have no idea what we will do,” he said, adding that he would try to recreate his floor-polishing business in Afghanistan. “If this works here, it is the best thing to do.”",World

The series, set to start from June 20, will kick off India’s new World Test Championship cycle.

“They’re an outstanding cricketing nation, who will come here with high hopes, and we are looking forward to seeing them. It’s important the guys refresh. We know where we want to get to as a Test team,” McCullum told ‘Sky Sports Cricket’.

England have just completed a whitewash of the West Indies in a six-match white-ball series. Their focus now shifts to the red-ball format as they gear up to take India and also prepare for the Ashes later this year. They will be without tearaway pacer Mark Wood, who has been ruled out of at least the first three Tests due to injury while fellow quick Jofra Archer will also miss the opening Test.

“There are some quality bowlers that are unavailable, but we have a nice, varied bowling attack with Chris Woakes, Sam Cook, Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue for the high-pace element. We have Shoaib Bashir, who is growing in Test cricket every day. We know we are going to be tested against India, and they will arrive prepared,” McCullum said.

England all-rounder Jacob Bathel has been recalled and McCullum was all praise for the 21-year-old.

“Bethell has a good life in front of him. For a 21-year-old, he’s got a real poise, and that allows him to go out there and be present and show off his flair and talent,” McCullum said.

“The world is his oyster. He’s already becoming a leader in the dressing room which is what you want,” he added.

McCullum also mentioned Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett as the talents to look forward to.

“Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett have reminded me of Duckett and Zak Crawley in the Test game. We know how good Duckett is, but the power that Smith possesses is amazing.

“These guys are fearless, and if you add the craft, then you hope you end up with a rounded player.

In an interview with News 18, the filmmaker said there was nothing wrong in his film but people’s mindset who only focus to see these aspects of the film with a certain eye for it. “I feel like that there’s a lot of scrutiny on social media. I also believe that scrutiny tends to only happen on successful films. You tend to keep quiet if a film isn’t working at all. That’s when no one has any opinion and they don’t say anything.

The move came just a day after his agency, Gold Medalist, secured a court order to seize YouTuber Kim Se Ui’s two apartments located in Seocho-dong’s Byuksan Blooming Complex and Hanyang 4th Complex. The total claim, worth 4 billion won ($2.9 million), was aimed at covering damages caused by Garos Sero’s allegations about Soo Hyun’s alleged inappropriate relationship with the late Kim Sae Ron, claims that led to him losing brand deals and having multiple K-drama projects put on hold.

The Queen of Tears star had purchased three apartments at the Galleria Forêt complex back in 2013 and 2014. Classys filed a lawsuit demanding ₩3.00 billion KRW (about $2.19 million USD) in penalties after cutting ties with the actor following the Kim Sae Ron controversy.

While his one-man agency likely has little say in the matter, his legal team has called the seizure unjustified. Labelling Soo Hyun as a victim of Garos Sero, who himself is on the verge of facing police summons in connection with another reopened case involving YouTuber Tzuyang, the counsel admitted that while the advertisers who signed the actor may be suffering financially, the real blame should fall on Kim Se Ui. Classys reportedly filed the case on May 8, and Seoul Eastern Court approved the seizure order on May 20.

https://indianexpress.com/article/world/un-to-vote-resolution-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release-aid-access-10062016/,"The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid.

The resolution, drafted by Spain and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, “strongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.”

Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.

Last week, the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid.

The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor.

There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.

After a 10-week blockade that barred all aid to Gaza, Israel is allowing the United Nations to deliver a trickle of food assistance and is backing a newly created U.S. aid group, which has opened several sites in the center and south of the territory to deliver food parcels.

But the aid system rolled out last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been troubled by near-daily shootings as crowds make their way to aid sites, while the longstanding U.N.-run system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order.

The draft resolution being voted on Thursday references a March 28 legally binding order by the top United Nations court for Israel to open more land crossings into Gaza for food, water, fuel and other supplies.

The International Court of Justice issued the order in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, charges Israel strongly denies.

The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.

It reiterates the assembly’s commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected.

The resolution supports mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States aimed at implementing a January ceasefire agreement.

When the U.S. vetoed last week’s Gaza resolution, acting Ambassador Dorothy Shea said it would have undermined the security of Israel and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire “that reflects the realities on the ground.”

Like the failed Security Council resolution, the resolution to be voted on Thursday also does not condemn Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza. Both are U.S. demands.

The Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. About 55 hostages are still being held. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

First, the LDF state government relocated its World Environment Day celebrations from the Raj Bhavan, claiming that the photo of Bharat Mata on display at the event was “one used by the RSS”. But, days later, Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar paid tributes to the same image during Goa Day celebrations at the Raj Bhavan.

Objecting to the use of the image at Raj Bhavan, CPI leader and Agriculture Minister P Prasad said, “A seat of a constitutional body should not be using this.”

Arlekar, who recently took over as Governor after a long period of fractious relationship between the LDF government and Raj Bhavan, hit back, saying, “Whatever be the pressure from whichever quarters, there will be no compromise whatsoever on Bharat Mata.” State BJP leader N Hari also attacked the LDF, claiming “they are afraid to say Bharat Mata… due to vote bank politics”.

While the symbolic icon of Bharat Mata, or Mother India, has often been depicted in art, there is no official version of the portrayal. The image used at the Kerala Raj Bhavan, for instance, depicted Bharat Mata holding a saffron flag in front of a relief map of India. The Left objected to this. Another image, used by the CPI for a local party event in the middle of the row incidentally, showed Bharat Mata carrying the Tricolour. As the BJP celebrated the Left’s use of the image, the party hastily withdrew the same.

How has Bharat Mata been depicted?

In the history of modern Indian art, Bharat Mata has adorned the canvas of only two artists of repute. The first was the product of the Bengal Renaissance, Abanindranath Tagore, who first visualised the Indian nation as the Mother. The second was the modernist M F Husain, whose painting of Bharat Mata was banned and trashed – and he was forced to spend his last years outside his country.

The imagery first appeared in the works of artists and writers in Bengal, much before it was used elsewhere in the context of India’s national movement for Independence.

Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 1882 novel Anand Math contained the hymn to the motherland Vande Mataram, which became the mantra of the freedom movement, and the official song of India after Independence. The novel depicts the three faces of Bharat Mata as Goddesses Jagaddhatri, Kali and Durga.

Two decades later, in 1905, after partition of Bengal under Lord Curzon, Abanindranath painted his iconic Bharat Mata, a woman in saffron robes, with a serene face and halo around her head, beads and scriptures in her hands. The revolutionary Aurobindo Ghose wrote in a letter to his wife Mrinalini Devi in August that same year: “I look upon my country as the Mother. I adore her, I worship Her as the Mother. What would a son do if a demon sat on his mother’s breast and started sucking her blood?”

Mother India retained her symbolic force through the national movement, even though the metaphor often changed with the speaker who employed it. In The Discovery of India, written by him in jail in the 1940s, Jawaharlal Nehru recounted his experience when people greeted him with slogans of “Bharat Mata ki Jai”. “Who was this Bharat Mata, Mother India, whose victory they wanted?… Mother India was essentially these millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these people,” he wrote.

The first major enunciation of the Mother India concept came in the writings of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya. “The foundation of our nationalism is Bharat Mata,” he wrote. “Remove Mata, Bharat will be reduced to just a piece of land.” However, this was merely a paraphrasing of what Bankim had written nearly a century ago, when he elaborated on the notion of Mother India as a woman having the characteristics of Sujala, Suphala (overflowing with water and laden with fruits) and Dashapraharana Dharini Durga (Goddess Durga with her 10 weapons), Lakshmi and Saraswati.

The imagery was also used in popular media and Hindi cinema – the iconic frame of actress Nargis, with a yoke and two babies, was an unforgettable cultural intervention, in 1957’s film Mother India.

What were the early criticisms around Bharat Mata?

Several historians have pointed out that the Bharat Mata visualised by its pioneers was more a “Banga Mata”, or Mother Bengal, with the deities they invoked being Kali and Durga, often their family deities. In Vande Mataram, Bankim called upon only the “sapt koti” or seven crore people of Bengal.

The first critics of the metaphor too came from among its inventors. Fifteen years after the Partition of Bengal, in August 1920, Aurobindo underlined the limits of the slogan and sought a greater mantra: “We used the Mantra Bande Mataram with all our heart and soul… (but) the cry of the Mantra began to sink and as it rang feebly, the strength began to fade out of the country… A greater Mantra than Bande Mataram has to come.”

The first two paragraphs of Bankim’s Vande Mataram were adopted as the national song after Independence. The government did not retain the verses that mentioned either “sapt koti”, or the eulogies to the Goddesses Durga and Lakshmi. The obvious reference to Bengali nationhood was removed.

Almost up to Independence, few underlined the religious overtones of the slogan, and it remained an essential mantra of an occupied country, a rallying call for its people. It found little resistance from other communities until 1947, when during the Partition riots, “Bharat Mata ki Jai” was perceived as a communal slogan, the same as “Allah-o-Akbar”.

But, barring some isolated voices against Vande Matram, Mother India remained a largely benign concept that did not attract controversy.

During the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the late 1980s, however, “Bharat Mata ki Jai” was used for communal mobilisation. Now Bharat Mata was an aggressive image, carrying swords and other weapons, and sometimes riding a tiger.

How has Bharat Mata imagery been used recently?

The Anna Hazare movement of 2011, one of the biggest mass mobilisations of recent decades, which shook the Central government and paved the way for the emergence ultimately of Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party, used the image of Bharat Mata as the rallying point for an anti-corruption crusade.

More recently, in February 2023, the Indian Council for Historical Research, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Education, faced “objections” over a photo of Bharat Mata in its office, alongside pictures of President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The recent controversies over ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ slogan

In early 2016, after allegedly anti-India slogans were raised at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, leading to a sedition case against its then students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that youth should be taught to chant “Bharat Mata ki Jai”.

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi shot back, saying he would not chant “Bharat Mata ki Jai” even if a knife were put to his throat, prompting the Shiv Sena to tell Owaisi to “go to Pakistan”. RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale then referred to Owaisi as “anti-national” and a “traitor”.

Later, in March 2016, AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan was suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly for refusing to say “Bharat Mata ki Jai”, even as he said he was willing to chant “Jai Hind”. At the time, the BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP together backed a resolution to suspend Pathan for the remainder of the Budget Session.

However, weeks after the controversy, BJP veteran L K Advani called the row over the slogan “meaningless”, while Bhagwat said nobody should be “forced” to say “Bharat Mata ki Jai”.

In 2020, in the aftermath of the Delhi riots, former PM Manmohan Singh said the slogan was “being misused to construct a militant and purely emotional idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens” while speaking at the launch of a book titled ‘Who is Bharat Mata’.",Politics

And then, he pronounced a judgment that would go on to have epochal consequences for then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi — and India.

Allowing the petition of Raj Narain, who, following his loss to Indira Gandhi in the 1971 election, had moved court alleging electoral malpractices by the Prime Minister, Justice Sinha said, “This petition is allowed and the election of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi, Respondent No. 1, to the Lok Sabha is declared void… (Indira Gandhi) accordingly stands disqualified for a period of six years from the date of this order.”

On a weekday morning, nearly 50 years to the day Courtroom No 24 of the Allahabad High Court witnessed the defining moment, the tall, teak doors to the room stayed latched, with the court being shut for vacation. The room has now been redesignated ‘Nyay Kaksh or Courtroom 34’ as part of a regular administrative rejig.

Senior advocates practising in the High Court say the second-floor courtroom was chosen for specific security reasons. Considering the Prime Minister was appearing in court for her cross-examination on March 18 and March 19, 1975, the courtroom, at the far end of a corridor that is open only on one side, was considered the safest from a security point of view.

It was on April 24, 1971, that Raj Narain, a socialist who lost the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat to Indira Gandhi that year as a joint Opposition candidate of the Samyukta Socialist Party, challenged the election result alleging electoral malpractices and misuse of government machinery by the then Prime Minister. When the petition was filed, no one gave it a chance.

The petition was first listed before Justice William Broome, the last British judge of the High Court. But Broome retired in December 1971, after which it went to at least two different benches — that of Justice B N Lokur (father of former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur) and Justice K N Srivastava – but their retirements led to the petition being assigned to Justice Sinha in early 1975.

As the recording of the oral evidence started on February 12, 1975, the courtroom witnessed several high-profile witnesses on either side – P N Haksar, then vice chairman, Planning Commission, who appeared for Indira Gandhi; and L K Advani (then president of the Bhartiya Jan Sangh), Karpoori Thakur (ex-CM of Bihar) and S Nijalingappa (president of Congress-O) who deposed for Raj Narain.

Finally, it was time for the Prime Minister herself to appear in the witness box. She reached Allahabad on March 17, 1975, a day before her two-day cross examination.

By all accounts, people had poured into the court complex by 9 am, nearly an hour before Justice Sinha could arrive. Among those present in the court were leading advocates and political stalwarts of the time – Opposition leaders Madhu Limaye, Shyam Nandan Mishra (who later became Foreign Minister) and Rabi Ray (who later became Lok Sabha Speaker); and, on the other side, Indira Gandhi’s son Rajiv Gandhi and daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi.

An incident that’s now part of court lore is how, while the normal practice is for the witness to stand in the box, Indira Gandhi was provided a chair on a raised platform so that she would be on the same level as the judge. Indira Gandhi’s counsel S C Khare had requested Justice Sinha to constitute a Commission that would take her evidence in Delhi, but Sinha had disallowed it.

Days later, the arguments were wrapped up and the court closed for summer vacations on May 23, 1975.

In his book The Case That Shook India: The Verdict That Led to the Emergency, Prashant Bhushan, whose father Shanti Bhushan was counsel for Raj Narain and later became Union Law Minister, wrote of the many pressures Justice Sinha faced after May 23, when the arguments were wrapped up and the verdict awaited.

“A special task force of the CID was employed to find out the contents of the judgment,” wrote Prashant Bhushan, adding that CID sleuths made a couple of visits to the home of Justice Sinha’s steno Manna Lal.

Over the next three weeks, as he wrote the judgment, Justice Sinha is said to have locked himself up at home – with visitors and callers being told that he was away in Ujjain to see his elder brother, a professor.

Bhushan wrote that the night before the verdict, Justice Sinha also arranged for his steno Manna Lal to stay at Bungalow No 10, adjacent to the High Court building. The bungalow has since been demolished; in its place is a multi-story structure that’s part of the High Court complex.

At his home in Prayagraj’s Civil Lines, Justice Vipin Sinha, the second of Justice Sinha’s three sons, who retired as a judge of the Allahabad High Court in 2020, recalls the pressure the family faced in the days before and after the judgment. “I was in Class 11 then and those days were very hard for us. We got a lot of very abusive calls, so much so that we did not allow our father to answer the phone.”

Justice Shambhunath Srivastava, a retired judge of the Allahabad High Court who started his practice in 1968 and was present in the courtroom on June 12, 1975, recalls the moments that followed Justice Sinha’s verdict.

Some were surprised, some were shocked and Indira Gandhi’s counsel Khare rushed to firefight. His nephew and junior, V N Khare (who later became CJI), drafted a stay application in his handwriting, following which Justice Sinha granted a stay on his judgement for 20 days.

“Everything was done in such a hurry that the stay application was not even typed,” says Justice Srivastava.

Ashok Mehta, senior advocate and former Additional Solicitor General and presently Additional Advocate General of UP, who started his practice from the Allahabad High Court in 1980, speaks of the legacy Justice Sinha left behind with his judgment. “There are few judges who can match up to Justice Sinha and Justice H R Khanna (who delivered the lone dissenting judgment that the individual’s right to life and personal liberties are inalienable even when Emergency is in place). Whenever an election petition comes before court, the first matter that comes to our mind is that of Raj Narain vs Indira Gandhi. This is what we at Allahabad High Court must be proud of.”

Fifty years later, there are few who can bear witness to that day in Courtroom No 24. Justice Sinha, who passed away in March 2008, had in an interview to this correspondent in August 1996 played down the enormity of his judgment, saying, “For me, it was like any other matter. My job was over as soon as I delivered the verdict.”

Yet, according to those who have known Justice Sinha closely, there was more than one ‘judgment’ that day. Senior advocate Gopal Swarup Chaturvedi, a family friend of Justice Sinha’s, says Justice Sinha had prepared two orders – one allowing Raj Narain’s petition and the other dismissing it. Given the extremely high-profile nature of the case, the second petition was a red herring, meant to fob off those who were allegedly trying to access the judgment.

At 10 am on June 12, 1975, Justice Sinha read out from the first copy – a verdict that was to alter the course of the nation.",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/the-emergency-50-years-on-ruling-holds-a-mirror-stands-vigil-against-subversion-of-due-process-10061486/,"Fifty years after the Allahabad High Court on June 12, 1975 declared as void the 1971 election of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi — a judgment that set off a chain of events that led to the imposition of a national Emergency on June 25, 1975 — the ruling and what followed serve as a reminder of the fragility of democracy and the collective responsibility to guard against abuse of power.

After losing to Indira Gandhi from Rae Bareli in the 1971 Lok Sabha polls, Raj Narain, a candidate of the Samyukta Socialist Party, had moved the Allahabad High Court alleging electoral malpractices by the then Prime Minister.

Nearly four years after the election, the Allahabad High Court held Mrs Gandhi guilty on two counts. First, that she used a gazetted officer, her personal secretary Yashpal Kapoor, as her election agent, and two, that she had taken the support of state government officers — from the district magistrate to officials in the Public Works Department and the power department — to have rostrums constructed and supply power to loudspeakers that were installed for her election speeches.

On the other alleged malpractices — from using choppers of the Indian Air Force to travel to Rae Bareli to deliver her election speeches and file nominations, to invoking religion to prompt voters to vote for the Congress Party — the court ruled in Gandhi’s favour. However, Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha’s final 258-page ruling would mean an immediate disqualification for Indira Gandhi and dismissal as Prime Minister.

As Prime Minister Gandhi conflated her defeat in the case with a threat against the nation, she imposed a national Emergency on June 25, 1975, that sent India’s democracy into a tailspin for the next few years. For 21 months between June 1975 and January 1977, all constitutional guarantees were subverted — from suspension of civil rights by jailing political opponents without trial to censoring of the press, postponing elections and ruling by executive decree without consulting Parliament.

While delivering the verdict, Justice Sinha had granted a 20-day stay on the verdict after the PM’s lawyers made a case that there would be an imminent political vacuum in the country. In the 20 days, the Congress was to elect a new leader. However, the Congress Working Committee instead once again elected Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister, in a show of strength and public support in her favour.

In the meantime, she moved the Supreme Court on appeal. With the court on vacation, the crucial case was heard by a single-judge vacation bench of Justice V R Krishna Iyer.

In the Supreme Court, her lawyer Nani Palkhivala dismissed the findings of the High Court as mere “technicalities” that would not stand the scrutiny of the court in appeal.

Former Union Law Minister and veteran lawyer Shanti Bhushan, who appeared against Indira Gandhi in court, had said before the Supreme Court that “no republic can surrender its democratic destiny to a single soul without being guilty of overpowering the parliamentary process by a personality cult.”

The blank editorial in The blank editorial in The Indian Express after the Proclamation.

On June 24, 1975, after hearing arguments for an entire day, the court granted a “conditional stay” against the HC ruling. The condition was that while Indira Gandhi could not vote in Parliament, take part in proceedings of the House, or draw a salary as an MP, she could continue as Prime Minister till the SC finally decides the appeal.

For all the “political dust storm” it kicked up, the Supreme Court would go on to describe the Allahabad High Court ruling of June 12, 1975, as a “humdrum case”.

Ultimately, in November 1975, during the Emergency, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court verdict. Just three months earlier, in August 1975, Parliament had also brought in the 39th Constitutional amendment to put the election of the Prime Minister and President beyond the purview of judicial review. While a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court struck down the amendments, holding that free and fair elections are part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it reversed the High Court ruling.

However, the aftermath of the HC verdict had irreversibly changed the judiciary’s engagement with the executive. The imposition of Emergency brought in a hardline stance against dissent, not just in political circles but also in judicial review.

Judges who ruled against the Gandhi-led government policies during the Emergency or even upheld fundamental rights were sidelined and superseded in favour of those who toed the line.

For the first time ever, the government in 1973 tinkered with the seniority norm in choosing the Chief Justice of India and appointed Justice A N Ray as CJI. Again in 1977, Justice M H Beg was appointed CJI, overlooking Justice H R Khanna, who was first in seniority. Justice Ray was the lone dissenter in the 11-judge bench ruling of 1969 that struck down nationalisation of banks, a crucial socialist policy of the Indira Gandhi government. He also wrote a dissent in the 1973 Kesavananda ruling that laid down the basic structure doctrine. In 1977, as CJI, he upheld the suspension of civil liberties in the landmark case popularly known as the habeas corpus case. Justice H R Khanna, on the other hand, was the lone dissenter in the habeas corpus case and criticised the government for bypassing rule of law and fundamental rights.

The effect of the supersession of judges in those days continues to play out in how the judiciary guards its independence by calling the shots in the appointment of judges. The SC took over appointments, developing the collegium system from the government and, in 2015, struck down a constitutional amendment that gave the government a say in appointing judges.

Eventually, with Emergency lifted, elections were finally held in 1977 and Indira Gandhi was voted out of power. It ended the chain of events that the June 12 verdict started but the ruling still stands vigil against the subversion of due process by elected representatives and public officials such as the Prime Minister.",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/uddhav-raj-thackeray-patch-up-devendra-fadnavis-meet-taj-hotel-10062144/,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday held a closed-door meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at a five-star hotel in Mumbai, sparking speculation that he may be considering a realignment with the BJP-led Mahayuti government instead of an alliance with cousin Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT).

The meeting between the two leaders took place at Taj Lands End in Bandra and lasted over an hour. The meeting was neither pre-announced nor part of either leader’s official schedule.

The development comes after nearly two months of emotional appeals, symbolic gestures, and strategic signalling by the Shiv Sena (UBT) to reunite the Thackeray cousins under a unified ‘Marathi manoos’ banner. Uddhav, son Aaditya, and senior Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders like Sanjay Raut have repeatedly urged a reconciliation, claiming the larger cause of Marathi identity and regional pride warranted a reconciliation.

However, while Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders and workers had leaned heavily on public messaging—old photos, social media posts, and even the Saamana front page—the MNS has kept mum.

Though Raj hinted on an April 19 podcast that he prioritises Maharashtra over personal disagreements, his party quickly clarified that unity on issues does not equate to electoral alliances.

The MNS’s top leadership has insisted that no formal proposal has been received. On June 5, Raj’s son Amit had bluntly remarked that “alliances are not formed through media sound bites”, making it clear that the MNS was unmoved.

Thursday’s meeting with Fadnavis deepens that perception. Coming just days before both Raj (June 14) and Aaditya’s (June 13) birthdays—an occasion Shiv Sena (UBT) workers had tried to frame as symbolic for unity—this unscheduled engagement with Fadnavis suggests Raj may be playing a different game.

According to political observers in the state, the meeting cannot be a mere courtesy call as it comes at a time when the civic polls are set to be held and with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) a key target, an MNS-BJP alliance may gain more traction than a Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS one.

Responding to the meeting, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and former BMC mayor Kishori Pednekar said that it was too early to comment on the matter. “Let us wait and watch. Both brothers have called their differences minor, and there is also a shared feeling among the MNS and Sena UBT workers. So let us see how it goes.. it would be inappropriate to jump the gun now,” she said.

On Thursday, the Shiv Sena, led by Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, had also offered Raj the opportunity to join hands with them. “Earlier, too, during the Assembly, we had offered to ally. Now also, we are open to an alliance. We still offer Raj saheb to come with us,” Sena leader and minister Sanjay Shirsat had said.",Politics

The US is also partially evacuating its embassy in Iraq’s capital Baghdad and have asked all its non-essential US embassy staff and their dependents to leave the Middle East location over heightened regional security risks, US and Iraqi sources confirmed the development to Reuters on Wednesday.

However, the report doesn’t mention which type of risk was Washington talking about when it reportedly ordered its staff to leave the country but the reports have escalated the prices of oil by more than 4%.

When asked about the partial evacuations of non-essential staff in the US embassy of Baghdad, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said “The State Department regularly reviews American personnel abroad and this decision was made as a result of a recent review,” Reuters reported.

“They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we’ll see what happens. We’ve given notice to move out,” Trump told reporters. When asked if anything could be done to lower the security risk in the Middle East, Trump responded saying “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple, they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” referring to Iran.

The US State Department has also updated its travel advisory on Wednesday, stating “On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions.”

President Trump is reportedly aware about the matter, a White House official confirmed. Adding to Iraq, a US official said that the State Department has also authorized voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.

Though the US embassy in Kuwait, in a statement on Wednesday said it “has not changed its staffing posture and remains fully operational.” The partial evacuation in Baghdad comes at a time when the Middle East region is already ravaged by the Israel-Gaza war over the last 18 months and Washington is unable to reach a nuclear deal with Iran.

Detailing about Iran’s nuclear programme, President Trump told a podcast on Wednesday that he was growing less confident that a deal would be signed with Tehran. The United States wants Iran to immediately cease its uranium enriching programme, which could eventually help the Islamic country in manufacturing nuclear weapons. In exchange, the US is ready to lift economic sanctions imposed on Tehran.

However, the Republican leader’s effort to strike a nuclear deal with Iran appears to be deadlocked and the US intelligence agencies have reportedly indicated that Benjamin Netanyahu led Israel has been preparing to hit Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if their talks over a nuclear deal fails. Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said on Wednesday that if Iran gets hit by strikes, it would retaliate and destroy US bases in the region.",World
https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nripendra-misra-inyerview-ram-temple-narendra-modi-10061556/,"Since he was picked as the officer-architect-in-chief of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Nripendra Misra has made 120 trips to the town for work. In an interview with The Indian Express two days after the consecration of the statue of Ram as the king of Ayodhya, Misra, who served as the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his entire first term, reflects on his learnings in the past five years. Excerpts:

Since you were appointed the chairman of the Ram temple’s Construction Committee in February 2020, Ayodhya must have dominated your calendar?

Soon after my appointment, Covid was around the corner, and a national lockdown was ordered. I waited for about three months before starting my journey by car from Delhi to Ayodhya. It takes about nine hours. I arrived here with the two agreements — with L&T and Tata Consulting Engineers. Over the last five years, I have made about 120 trips to Ayodhya. And, each trip is a minimum of three days. I calculated that it is more than 365 days. More than a year of my life has been spent staying in the Circuit House in one room. Fortunately, they never changed that room. My day starts at 9 am and ends in the evening.

The seven new temples that have been built now…how do they relate to the Ram temple?

The seven new temples belong to Valmiki, Vishwamitra, Agastya, Vashistha, Nishadraj, Ahilya and Shabari. They were some of the key persons involved in Ram’s life journey, especially his growing up to be a maryada purushottam. These seven temples encapsulate the message that the Prime Minister is keen to spread — of social cohesion, and a feeling that Ram belongs to everyone.

After the consecration or Pran Pratistha in January 2024, what has been the Prime Minister’s message to you for the last year or so?

Whenever I have met the prime minister, not very frequently, but yes, whenever he is kind enough… at the temple, he wanted to understand the process, engineering. Because of his own experiences in Gujarat, having done the Sardar Patel statue, he was very familiar.

When I went for the first time, the controversy was at its peak about what kind of foundation and technology we should adopt because of the soil condition being close to the river and also close to Nepal earthquake features… So, that was the anxiety there. The moment I shared it with him, he expected this and said, ‘Yes, yes, that is the most important aspiration of sadhus… the temple should last a thousand years.’

The moment I landed here, ‘thousand years’ was ringing in my ears. So, I explained to him that we did the soil foundation, (which) he was familiar with completely…

So, these were the kind of details he was willing to listen to and give his best advice. And, a kind of relationship developed. Once this (temple) got completed, he was very concerned about ensuring people come from all directions of India and abroad – North, South, East, West. He was very worried that this temple should not become a temple of the North.

So, every time he inquired about the number of devotees coming, the expected ratio, the proportion of people coming from the South. He felt at one stage that people who come from the South should not only accept it, but they should feel homely (at home). Please develop Ayodhya in a manner that it has cosmopolitan features. His other concern was the youth. He kept on repeating that the youth will ask what Ayodhya is and who Lord Rama is. He wanted them to know the cultural heritage of this country.

So, many people say that Prime Minister Modi is the kind of prime minister who has revived the cultural heritage and wealth of this nation. This (the Ram temple in Ayodhya), according to him, was the central point around which we could then weave the other structures. Be it Kedarnath, be it Shiva temple in Madhya Pradesh, be it Ram temple somewhere in Maharashtra or Rameshwaram in South. The cultural revival, not in the conservative sense, but in the sense of an entire thought process.

Nripendra Misra, the Ayodhya Ram temple’s officer-architect-in-chief, served as the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Nripendra Misra, the Ayodhya Ram temple’s officer-architect-in-chief, served as the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his entire first term, and was appointed the Chairman of the temple construction committee in February 2020. (Vishal Srivastav)

For the temple movement, led by the BJP, Ayodhya was a cause for correcting a historical wrong. Do you think a reconciliation has been achieved?

The message I was given by the prime minister was that there should be nothing negative about what happened. There are inscriptions in front of the temple in Hindi and English. Nowhere have we used the name that such and such person came and he destroyed the temple. It is mentioned, of course, that the temple got destroyed, then the aandolan and finally culmination in the Supreme Court judgement, and its acceptance at the national level.

The PM’s message was, please do not discuss negative thoughts. He kept mentioning that if you make that a prominent message, the younger generation would feel small. He did not want the younger generation to suffer from these temporary shocks that Sanatan Dharma faced. The younger generation should know how we have regained and conserved.

You have been in the government for long – as a DM, a telecom regulator, and then in the Prime Minister’s office. Having seen politics, economy and society from a vantage position, how do you interpret the post-temple mood among those who were part of the movement? Do you see them moving forward or do you see multiple claims still coming for temples to be built in different places?

I place this responsibility not so much on the government. It will have to be of various social groups, representatives, elected or not elected – they must recognise. They have limits on correcting issues. We all know that the time which has gone does not come back. We do not keep it in our clutches. Once they realise that the time has gone by and once they realise the dream of the future while living in the present, then the society will be more positive, and will look towards the issues of development.

After all, there is another agenda. You and I are worried. There is 7% growth. Will I maintain it? I am going to be the third country in terms of economic power very soon. Why can’t I become number 2 or 1? China is always in our memory – that they are far ahead of us. If these are the challenges, we weaken society by disintegration. We should rather strengthen the society to divert this energy to development… Social leaders of my country have a great responsibility.

In size, India would probably replace Japan as the fourth-largest economy… From the economic point of view, what should be the focus?

…we may have crossed (Japan) but they don’t have so many poor, they don’t have problems with proper nourishment. They don’t have problems with education and health. I may say that I produce maximum milk, but does everyone take milk? The answer is no. So, my target should not be that I am maximum (at these parameters). My target should be, am I giving each individual the gains of my growth? I put health, wellness, hospitals at number 1, education at number 2, and third and most important is empowering the rural women. My agenda will be to achieve these goals.

The inclusivity of the Ayodhya project is reflected in what you said. But we also see Sambhal (the row over Jama Masjid there) coming up…

It’s a problem. It’s very special, deeper. Certain issues are in some manner localised. I always say the judgment on the Ram temple was accepted by all only because it was by the Supreme Court. Everything got normalised. Everyone was then following daily routines. We can not seek justice for the past. It has to be forgotten.

The temple construction is almost over. You are also the Chairperson of the Prime Ministers Museum and Library. What role do you visualise for yourself over the next few years?

I am speaking about this for the first time. I have started thinking how long and how much. Perhaps, I will have to set the path, that I am useful up to this point, and beyond that I must divert my energies somewhere else. I am there in the Sangrahalaya. That assignment is with me. I will have to find some kind of constructive work to devote my time after six months or so.

Do you see the Ayodhya city growing in terms of prosperity, too, alongside the rise in tourism?

When I first came from Lucknow, Ayodhya was not even the size of a tehsil town. While we were seeing this battle in the courts and in other places, the local inhabitants belonging to different communities grabbed it (the opportunity)… A person earning Rs 500 is earning Rs 1,000 today. With that, of course, economic exploitation will come. People are encroaching on land. Speculation of land price is at its peak because the investments are coming, and the investment people want to maximise gains. At this stage, a planned growth is required.

The temple pulls devotees and tourists. Do you think there should be more to make them stay in Ayodhya, since people come here but leave by evening?

Yes. This should not become Agra. People stay in Delhi, come to Agra, and return. There is nothing else in Agra except the Taj Mahal. That was one agenda in my mind. Outside the premises of Ram temple, the social-cultural site has to be found. So, people spend a day or two more in Ayodhya. We must build 5-stars, community halls, and there have to be a lot more cultural presentations.",Politics

SBI Cards has quietly built a massive customer base of over 2 crore cards, capturing nearly 20% of India’s credit card market. Its profits grew 39% quarter-on-quarter, although still down 19% from last year. In many ways, it has been a rollercoaster both in the markets and in the business.

So, where does SBI Cards go from here? And what should investors make of it today?

Where SBI Cards stands today: Business and numbers at a glance

At its core, SBI Cards is a credit card company. It is not a bank. It does not take deposits. It earns money through interest on outstanding card balances and various fees when customers spend, withdraw, or convert purchases into EMIs. That focus makes it different from traditional lenders and also gives it more room to grow as India’s digital economy expands.

Story continues below this ad

As of March 2025, SBI Cards had over 2.08 crore cards in force, giving it close to a 19% share of the Indian credit card market. That makes it the second-largest issuer in the country, after HDFC Bank, and by far the largest non-bank player in this space.

The card base has grown steadily, up 10% over the past year. In the last quarter alone, it added over 11 lakh new accounts, keeping its run rate stable. What is notable is that 63% of its sourcing came through SBI’s bank channels, showing the strength of its parent tie-up. The rest came from open-market channels, like digital platforms and foot-on-the-street sales.

When it comes to card usage, the numbers are equally strong.

In FY25, total customer spends grew 11% year-on-year to Rs 3.3 lakh crore. Within this, retail spends alone touched Rs 3.03 lakh crore, while corporate card usage also bounced back, especially in Q4.

For context, SBI Cards’ spend market share stands at 15.6%, showing that customers are not just holding the cards but actively using them.

FY25 Snapshot. Source: Company’s Q4FY25 Report FY25 Snapshot. Source: Company’s Q4FY25 Report

On the lending side, card receivables (loans outstanding on cards) grew by 10% to Rs 55,840 crore.

More importantly, about 59% of this book is interest-bearing, meaning these customers either revolve balances or convert purchases into EMIs, which are the primary sources of revenue for the company. Around 35% of the portfolio is in EMIs, while the rest are transactors who pay in full and on time.

Overall Card Specific Details. Source: Company’s Q4FY25 Report Overall Card Specific Details. Source: Company’s Q4FY25 Report

In terms of revenue, SBI Cards clocked Rs 18,637 crore in total income in FY25, up ~7% from the previous year. Interest income grew strongly, supported by rising yields and stable spreads. However, fee income was flat, and that pulled down overall revenue growth.

And then the big pressure point is around profitability.

Net profit fell by 20% to Rs 1,916 crore, even as profits jumped 39% sequentially in Q4. The yearly decline was due to high credit costs, essentially more provisioning for customers who missed payments, and a bit of pressure on fee-based income.

So, the top line is growing. Usage is solid. The card base is expanding. But the bottom line took a hit, and that is what sets the tone for the next part on why credit costs are rising and what SBI Cards is doing about it.

The credit cost spike: What went wrong and what SBI Cards is doing about it

Credit cards are unsecured loans, which means when customers default, there is no asset to recover. That makes credit cost management the most critical part of the business.

In FY25, this is where SBI Cards faced its biggest challenge.

The company’s gross credit cost jumped to 9.0%, up from 7.1% in FY24. That means for every Rs 100 in loans, it had to set aside Rs 9 to cover potential losses. These are levels last seen during pandemic disruptions.

In the March 2025 quarter alone, SBI Cards wrote off nearly Rs 1,300 crore worth of loans, with gross NPAs reaching 3.08%, a slight improvement from the previous quarter, but still elevated.

The slowdown in job creation, rising EMI burdens, and post-Covid credit fatigue are all playing a part. But in SBI Cards’ case, the surge in write-offs was sharper, especially among certain borrower segments sourced aggressively in earlier quarters.

To its credit, management acted early. Over the last 5-6 quarters, SBI Cards has taken several steps:

● Tightening of underwriting: New customer sourcing now leans more towards higher credit score segments. The share of “prime and above-prime” borrowers has risen significantly in new acquisitions.

● Stronger portfolio monitoring: Delinquency trends are being tracked more granularly, especially for customers showing early signs of stress.

● Improved collections strategy: The company expanded both physical and digital collection efforts to engage with at-risk borrowers earlier and offer structured repayment options.

● Model refresh: The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) framework was updated this year, and provision buffers were realigned based on actual customer behaviour rather than only historical models.

All this has started showing some effect. Stage 2 and Stage 3 balances, basically the risky parts of the loan book, declined sequentially in Q4. Credit costs also came down slightly from 9.4% in Q3 to 9.0% in Q4, suggesting that the worst might be behind.

The management believes credit costs have peaked and should gradually moderate over the next few quarters. As the CEO implies, “The unsecured lending ecosystem still has unknowns.” Which is why SBI Cards has chosen to grow slowly and clean up the base before pushing hard again.

The short-term pain here is real. But so is the effort to fix it.

How SBI Cards is building for the future: Digital, UPI, and more

Even as it dealt with rising credit costs, SBI Cards did not slow down on building for the next phase of growth. In fact, some of its biggest strategic moves in FY25 happened quietly in the background, especially in digital and payments innovation.

1. Digital onboarding at scale

One of the most impactful shifts has been how SBI Cards acquires new customers. The company rolled out a fully digital onboarding platform called SBI Card Sprint. This was integrated across bank branches and direct-to-customer channels. As a result, a majority of bank-sourced cards were onboarded digitally in FY25.

This shift matters because digital onboarding means:

● Faster application processing (using AI-based validation)

● Fewer errors or document gaps

● Lower acquisition costs

● Better tracking of customer quality from day one

It also reflects a larger trend: SBI Cards is now targeting the digital-first, mobile-savvy Indian customer, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This is where the next wave of credit card users will come from.

2. Tapping the UPI boom

A game-changing move in FY25 was the integration of RuPay credit cards with UPI. This allowed users to tap and pay at QR-code terminals using their credit card, something not possible until recently.

The results were instant. SBI Cards saw UPI-based credit card spends grow over 4X year-on-year.

What makes this even more exciting is that the top UPI spend categories, such as groceries, utilities, fuel, apparel, and restaurants, are daily essentials. This means credit card usage is becoming part of everyday Indian spending, even in places without card machines.

This is a big unlock for SBI Cards, especially in smaller towns where QR codes are everywhere but POS terminals are not. Unlike debit UPI, credit UPI earns fees and interest for the issuer, making it a profitable shift.

3. Product innovation and premium push

On the product side, SBI Cards continues to expand its portfolio thoughtfully. In FY25, it launched:

● SBI Card Miles, a travel-oriented card targeting premium consumers

● KrisFlyer SBI Card, in partnership with Singapore Airlines

● Expanded its fuel card footprint – BPCL SBI Card crossed 4 million users

These moves show a clear direction: focus on high-spend, high-value customers, where fee and interest income is stronger. Alongside, the company also ran hundreds of targeted offers and deals across categories, enabled by a new hyper-personalisation platform that recommends offers based on user behaviour.

The company is also making a quiet entry into the corporate and commercial card space, a segment that is less risky, more predictable, and has cross-sell potential. Corporate spends in Q4 grew by over 60% quarter-on-quarter.

In short, it appears that SBI Cards has utilised FY25 to modernise its core. The real question now is whether it can build on this foundation to accelerate again.

What should investors expect next? Outlook and valuation

From its IPO in March 2020 to now, SBI Cards’ stock has delivered just ~6% CAGR, a modest return considering the initial excitement. But those headline numbers mask a business that has gone through multiple economic cycles, regulatory shifts, and internal restructuring in just five years.

The company has now reached a point where its core growth levers are reset and ready:

● Card additions are healthy, with a robust pipeline through SBI’s bank channels.

● Spends are growing steadily, with digital and UPI adding tailwinds.

● High-risk accounts are being cleaned up, and credit costs appear to have peaked.

● New revenue streams like corporate cards and EMI products are scaling up.

The question then becomes how the business should be valued from here?

As of FY25, SBI Cards reported:

● EPS of Rs 20.2, down from Rs 25.2 in FY24 due to elevated credit costs.

● Return on Assets (RoA) of 3.1% and Return on Equity (RoE) of 14.6%, a decline, but still relatively healthy compared to some of the other NBFCs.

● The company maintains a capital adequacy ratio of 22.9%, which provides ample buffer for growth.

At its current market price, SBI Cards trades at roughly:

● 50x FY25 earnings

● 7x book value

These are rich multiples, especially when compared to private banks or diversified NBFCs. But they also reflect the company’s unique positioning:

● Pure-play credit card business with no exposure to secured lending

● Access to a vast base of SBI customers, a competitive advantage no other issuer has

● Structural tailwinds from India’s shift to digital payments, EMI financing, and UPI-linked credit usage

That said, the path to re-rating from here is conditional.

For SBI Cards to trade back at 30x+ earnings and deliver 20-25% upside from current levels, a few things need to happen:

● Credit costs must normalise to 6-7% levels

● Fee income must rebound, helped by higher activity and new partnerships

● Margin profile should stabilise, with controlled cost-to-income ratios

● The market must get comfortable with moderate but profitable growth, rather than breakneck expansion

On the flip side, downside risks include:

● Prolonged stress in unsecured lending

● Regulatory changes that cap interest or fee income

● Rising competition in digital-first credit cards, especially from fintechs and NBFCs

Final take

SBI Cards is no longer in its hyper-growth phase, but it is not in decline either. It is entering a more mature, more strategic phase of growth, one that prioritises quality over scale.

For long-term investors looking at India’s consumption story, SBI Cards offers a direct play on credit, digitisation, and rising middle-class aspirations. But it requires patience and a close watch on how the company manages risk in a market that is evolving faster than ever.

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/anubhav-sinha-writes-where-cinema-belongs-10061398/,"Why are we not watching films in theatres as we used to? What has gone wrong with that thrilling, joyous collective experience? Why has the business of screening films in theatres been struggling in India?

I have been writing and directing for 30 years, and producing films for around 15 years. I have made films with unknown, first-time actors, with big stars and superstars. I have made out-and-out commercial films and rather grim, deliberately discomforting political films. And for the past two years, I have been trying to understand why fewer and fewer people watch a film in a theatre. I don’t have a definitive answer but I do have some clues.

Advertisement

Since the Lumière brothers screened eight of their short films on December 28, 1895, at the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris, since the first film theatres were set up in 1910, the relatively young art of filmmaking has grown through a collaboration of several older art forms — writing, theatre, music, painting, sculpture, and photography. Its practitioners and critics have debated for a century its various aspects but the singular aspect of the business that has never been in doubt has been the collective experience of the audience. And so it remains.

Watching a film with a group of strangers and friends in a theatre is somewhat like eating with family or friends at a fine-dining restaurant. You can order the same food home; the ingredients and the recipe would be the same but you wouldn’t have the ambience, the chatter, the energy. That is what collective experience is about. Food is experienced with the five senses. Cinema, too, demands that.

In popular conversation, cinema is wrongly lumped with television, and increasingly, with streaming platforms. But it is different. To create a “new” experience every time you go to a theatre for a collective experience is cinema’s inherent endeavour. That’s where it earns its joy and money from. Streaming platforms and television are a different experience, a different recipe. They play in a domestic or personal space, on a television, computer or phone screen. I have written, directed and produced for both over the past 30 years. They are less about your experience and more about your attention. They earn their joy and money from how long you were watching. Experience is a priority, too, but only to make you stick around longer.

How do they know how long you will stick around? Well, the algorithm. Before we speak of algorithms, however, we must speak of samosas. Our collective experience of samosas is that we have our favourite streetside shops that we think make the best ones in the world. When a food giant decides he will be the biggest samosa company in town, he will buy and hire all the existing samosa manufacturers. He will conduct a survey: Why do people like samosas? Why do some people eat more samosas than others? Why do some samosas sell more than others? He will collect data from across the city about the patterns and scales of samosa consumption. He will build an algorithm. And he will use this database to “standardise” the production and taste of samosas across the city. The samosa company is driven to maximise profits. The individual artistic innovation of samosas across the city — more green chilli at the Chowk, more coriander at the Ghantaghar — holds little value for it.

The algorithm understands you. You watch three reels about strength training and you are inundated with similar reels. You shape the algorithm but eventually the algorithm shapes you. The algorithm wants you to stay longer, makes you stay longer, makes you follow a predictable pattern. It is a cage. It tries to standardise art and that is the death, or near-death, of it. You stop taking chances.

That’s the reason cinema should relentlessly try to create new experiences. Art wants you to experience new skies. The leap of faith doesn’t tell you where you will land. You may crash but that is the fun of the flight.

Sadly, we are atomising as a society and the idea of collective experience is declining. At bus stops, on trains, in restaurants, at home, in parks, people are just not together. They are on their devices caged inside their bespoke algorithms.

Money is shrinking, upwards. The budget for entertainment, let us assume, remains the same. The avenues for entertainment are increasing and so is the idea of entertainment. Attention spans are declining. Going to a movie theatre is a big investment, not only financially but also in terms of time. Devoting yourself for three hours to a movie is a big deal. The audience will slowly exhibit a pattern, the producers will see it. The filmmaking economics will change. It’s all in churn at the moment. Some films will be Friday films, some will need a longer run. The exhibition sector, too, has to hold the hand of both kinds of films. Hopefully, in times to come, money will trickle down better and we will all venture out more.

What should worry us more is protecting and nourishing the idea of being with each other. Holi, Eid and Diwali aren’t quite the social glue they were; in bigger cities, they are increasingly becoming occasions for out-of-town holidays. We need to rediscover and rekindle the joys and frustrations of sitting together, talking, arguing, laughing, and eating together.

Cinema will find its new equilibrium. There will always be big-ticket films that aspire to hit the jackpot and there will always be films that innovate, experiment and say the unpopular. Sometimes they will land, sometimes they will crash. Films will have different intentions and different box-office results. Both La Nouvelle Vague (French New Wave) and Dogme (Danish avant-garde film movement) had seminal impacts. It is not very wise to compare the box-office collections of Mission Impossible with The Banshees of Inisherin (2022), or Chhaava with Laapataa Ladies (2023). Some films are easy to fund; some are not.

The audience will be surprised to know the way films are funded but that is not their business. Their business is to like films or not. Let it be ours to keep trying to find a balance between the films you like and the ones we want to make. The film business is attractive from the outside and treacherous from the inside. Even the most seasoned businessmen do not get it. Only those who have played it long enough begin to understand how super-strong equations on paper end up losing money and the improbable ones win.

Films have very unconventional revenue streams. It is not the business of the audience to figure out which one is a hit or a flop. You don’t care whether your favourite restaurant, shoe brand, ice cream or mobile phone company makes profits or losses. You like them and you consume them. Films are no different. Not every film will do 100 crore at the box office. Not every film that does 100 crore is a hit. Not every film that does 30 crore is a flop. There is so much more data nuance that will never reach you. Simply sit back, relax and enjoy the movies. It is that simple.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indus-treaty-more-storage-for-projects-in-first-stages-no-change-in-others-says-govt-10059390/,"Union Power Minister Manohar Lal said Tuesday that India will plan more water storage for hydro projects in J&K that are still in the initial stages, but no changes will be made for projects already in the pipeline.

At a media briefing, the Minister said, “Where Indus Waters Treaty is concerned, no changes will be made for projects that are in the pipeline, because the technical details have been finalised. There are some projects that are in the initial stages, for which we can plan more water storage and electricity generation.”

Following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, the government put in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, which restricts hydroelectric projects in the Indus river basin from including any significant water storage capacity. Now, the government is likely to increase storage capacity for new projects.

Currently, there are four hydro projects in J&K that have been concurred by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the country’s apex power planning body, but are yet to be taken up for construction.

These include New Ganderbal (93 MW) on the Sindh Nallah, Kirthai-II (930 MW) and Sawalkot (1,856 MW) on the Chenab, and Uri-I Stage-II (240 MW) on the Jhelum. As of April, all these projects are planned as run-of-the-river, with three including limited pondage capacity.

The CEA is also exploring the Bursar storage-based hydro project (800 MW) on the Marusudar river, a tributary of the Chenab, which is currently under the survey and investigation (S&I) stage. Two more run-of-the-river projects – Dulhasti Stage-II (260 MW) and Kirthai I (390 MW) – are also under examination.

According to the CEA, J&K has a balance potential of nine more hydro projects, with a cumulative capacity of 1,088 MW. Out of these, two are planned with storage – Gangbal (48 MW) and Wardwan Bursar (255 MW) – and the remaining are all run-of-the-river projects.

Earlier, The Indian Express had reported that the Centre was looking to fast-track four hydroelectric projects on the Chenab – Pakal Dul (1,000 MW), Ratle (850 MW), Kiru (624 MW), and Kwar (540 MW). Pakal Dul is the first storage-based hydro project being built in J&K.

Once completed, it will have a live storage capacity of nearly 109 million cubic metres (mcm) and is expected to be commissioned by September 2026, according to the CEA.

At the briefing, Manohar Lal also said the country’s power sector faced cyberattacks in “large numbers” during Operation Sindoor, all of which were countered by installed firewalls.

“During Operation Sindoor, (power sector) systems were attacked in large numbers. However, we countered each attack, hence there were no losses.”

Power Secretary Pankaj Agarwal said heavy malicious traffic was detected and addressed by firewalls.

The Minister said, “Cybersecurity is being strengthened for all projects, be it generation, transmission or distribution. Even imported items used in projects are being scrutinised, because anyone can attempt cyberattacks.”",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-challenges-poll-battles-10057619/,"While listing the achievements of the Narendra Modi government, BJP national president and Union Minister J P Nadda on Monday said it had achieved “unimaginable and unique” success.

As the Modi government 3.0 completed its first year, the upbeat mood was a far cry from the sense of disappointment that prevailed this time last year, when the party fell short of a simple majority and returned to power at the Centre with reduced strength. The BJP’s victories in three of the five Assembly elections since then — Haryana, Maharashtra, and Delhi — were one of the major reasons why the party appears to have got the bounce back in its step. The government also maintained its commitment to reforms, passing the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill and initiating the process of moving towards simultaneous elections.

However, several challenges remain on the political and governance fronts, with BJP leaders saying that the biggest test continues to be job creation. “If India’s emergence as an economic power should yield any lasting political outcomes, we have to have more jobs for the youth. FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) is stagnant and manufacturing is not going up despite cutting down corporate tax in 2019, how can we create jobs?” said a BJP MP, who did not wish to be named.

He also pointed out that the country was still lagging in skill development despite its potential to be the biggest provider of skilled workers.

The BJP has made efforts since 2014 to transform the youth into a committed support base. “But it remains a challenge. Without skill development and jobs, the youth will not be at your side for long,” said a leader.

Another leader said there was one more thing the party needed to do better to get into a position to influence the youth. “Even with the new education policy, the BJP still has not been able to influence the youth or academia with its core ideology. If we want to be the party that remains at the top, we need to see this as a challenge. We will not be able to influence the youth without it,” he said.

The volatility on the global stage is also a matter of concern for some as it has an effect not just on foreign policy but also on domestic politics and policy-making.

Political challenges

While the Opposition, which defied expectations in the Lok Sabha polls, stands fragmented, especially after Operation Sindoor, the BJP-led NDA remains in a position of strength. “The NDA will complete this term and win again,” Nadda said Monday.

But that does not mean the ruling alliance has it easy. BJP leaders admitted that managing coalition partners was an added responsibility, but said they do not envision any “big trouble” in keeping N Chandrababu Naidu and the TDP on their side. However, the JD(U), a crucial ally at the Centre as well as Bihar, where elections are due later this year, may not be as easy, according to party leaders.

“Their (JD-U’s) indecisiveness is the biggest issue. The ambiguity of (Chief Minister) Nitish Kumar’s party about its future could create problems for us. They handle the state and have a role in policy-making at the Centre. Who is going to be its leader will be an issue for the BJP too,” said a BJP functionary.

Bihar, the only Hindi heartland state where the BJP has never been able to form a government on its own, is crucial if the party has to maintain its pre-eminent position nationally. That requires the BJP to tackle the political situation in the state without wasting much time.

South and Bengal

After Bihar, the BJP also has to face electoral tests in the south, a region that has still not opened up for it and where the party has yet to shed its image as a party of Hindi-speaking, upper-class north Indians.

Next year, Kerala and Tamil Nadu go to the polls along with Puducherry. Making electoral gains and expanding are still uphill battles for the party in the two states, even though it has made some headway in recent years. In Tamil Nadu, the party has struck an alliance with the AIADMK, but party leaders admit it is going to be a tightrope walk there. The BJP has had to almost surrender itself to the AIADMK to stitch together an anti-DMK front.

In both Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the BJP has to take measures to counter the Opposition’s narrative about it being an anti-minority party. This will matter especially in Kerala, where the party has been trying to reach out to Christians to consolidate its position. The BJP’s newly appointed state president, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, has initiated several measures to shed the anti-minority image, with BJP leaders saying the party has to “work hard” to achieve this. In a recent interview, Chandrasekhar admitted the party had failed to counter such a narrative in the past.

West Bengal, another crucial battleground that is key to the party’s national agenda, also goes to the polls in 2026 and will be a big test of the BJP’s election machinery. The party has yet to reinvigorate its state unit, which is bogged down by factionalism and other internal crises. That the situation in Bengal is far from ideal is illustrated by the fact that the central leadership had not yet been able to appoint a state president or a new team to start poll preparations.

BJP insiders say that the absence of a strong second-rung leadership nationally and in state units, including in strongholds, is something that the party brass has to address going forward.

“We have to get new and fresh leaders for the future,” said a BJP leader. “As a dominant party, the BJP has to prepare for the future too. The time has come to make changes.”",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/business/apple-researchers-ai-models-collapse-complex-problems-10058014/,"A new research paper by a group of people at Apple has said that artificial intelligence (AI) ‘reasoning’ is not all that it is cracked up to be. Through an analysis of some of the most popular large reasoning models in the market, the paper showed that their accuracy faces a “complete collapse” beyond a certain complexity threshold.

The researchers put to the test models like OpenAI o3-mini (medium and high configurations), DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-32B, and Claude-3.7- Sonnet (thinking). Their findings showed that the AI industry may be grossly overstating these models’ capabilities. They also benchmarked these large reasoning models (LRMs) with large language models (LLMs) with no reasoning capabilities, and found that in some cases, the latter outperformed the former.

“In simpler problems, reasoning models often identify correct solutions early but inefficiently continue exploring incorrect alternatives — an ‘overthinking’ phenomenon. At moderate complexity, correct solutions emerge only after extensive exploration of incorrect paths. Beyond a certain complexity threshold, models completely fail to find correct solutions,” the paper said, adding that this “indicates LRMs possess limited self-correction capabilities that, while valuable, reveal fundamental inefficiencies and clear scaling limitations”.

Story continues below this ad

For semantics, LLMs are AI models trained on vast text data to generate human-like language, especially in tasks such as translation and content creation. LRMs prioritise logical reasoning and problem-solving, focusing on tasks requiring analysis, like math or coding. LLMs emphasise language fluency, while LRMs focus on structured reasoning.

To be sure, the paper’s findings are a dampener on the promise of large reasoning models, which many have touted as a frontier breakthrough to understand and assist humans in solving complex problems, in sectors such as health and science.

The puzzles

Apple researchers evaluated reasoning capabilities of LRMs through four controllable puzzle environments, which allowed them fine-grained control over complexity and rigorous evaluation of reasoning:

Tower of Hanoi: It involves moving n disks between three pegs following specific rules, with complexity determined by the number of disks.

Story continues below this ad

Checker Jumping: This requires swapping red and blue checkers on a one-dimensional board, with complexity scaled by the number of checkers.

River Crossing: This is a constraint satisfaction puzzle where and actors and n agents must cross a river, controlled by the number of actor/agent pairs and boat capacity.

Blocks World: Focuses on rearranging blocks into a target configuration, with complexity managed by the number of blocks.

“Most of our experiments are conducted on reasoning models and their non-thinking counterparts, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking/non-thinking) and DeepSeek-R1/V3. We chose these models because they allow access to the thinking tokens, unlike models such as OpenAI’s o-series. For experiments focused solely on final accuracy, we also report results on the o-series models,” the researchers said.

How complexity affected reasoning

The researchers found that as problem complexity increased, the accuracy of reasoning models progressively declined. Eventually, their performance reached a complete collapse (zero accuracy) beyond a specific, model-dependent complexity threshold.

Apple analysis of AI models (Source: Apple) Apple analysis of AI models (Source: Apple)

Initially, reasoning models increased their thinking tokens proportionally with problem complexity. This indicates that they exerted more reasoning effort for more difficult problems. However, upon approaching a critical threshold (which closely corresponded to their accuracy collapse point), these models counter-intuitively began to reduce their reasoning effort (measured by inference-time tokens), despite the increasing problem difficulty.

Their work also found that in cases where problem complexity is low, non-thinking models (LLMs) were capable to obtain performance comparable to, or even better than thinking models with more token-efficient inference. With medium complexity, the advantage of reasoning models capable of generating long chain-of-thought began to manifest, and the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs increased. But, where problem complexity is higher, the performance of both models collapsed to zero. “Results show that while thinking models delay this collapse, they also ultimately encounter the same fundamental limitations as their non-thinking counterparts,” the paper said.

It is worth noting though that the researchers have acknowledged their work could have limitations: “While our puzzle environments enable controlled experimentation with fine-grained control over problem complexity, they represent a narrow slice of reasoning tasks and may not capture the diversity of real-world or knowledge-intensive reasoning problems.”",Technology
https://indianexpress.com/article/research/from-revolution-to-wars-the-history-of-harvard-americas-oldest-university-10051692/,"It’s a challenging time for America’s oldest university, as it stands embroiled in a legal battle with President Donald Trump’s government. And yet, Harvard has been holding its own; a reflection of the values that have marked its long and prestigious history, one that was marked by resilience and rebellion.

“The debut of Harvard College,” according to Bainbridge Bunting in Harvard: An Architectural History (1985), “was not auspicious.” Established in October 1636, Harvard had neither the finances nor the faculty needed to operate a university. But what it did have was the vision of a group of cultivators and artisans who fled the tyranny of British occupants in Old England and moved to a region in the northeastern United States called New England. This group, according to Bunting, “had the advantage of the best education available in England in the seventeenth century.” Comprising the alumni of both Oxford and Cambridge universities, they hoped to give their sons a comparable education.

The absence of an institution of repute in New England led to the genesis of Harvard, the oldest of America’s Ivy League schools. “Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Brown are all plugged in the northeast, in New England. Harvard has played a major role in building this geographical cluster,” says Mohit Sinha, an alumnus of Harvard, in an interview with indianexpress.com.

An eight-acre house comprising a one-acre cow yard was quickly purchased to build the College. By 1637, Harvard had its first Master, Cambridge alumnus Nathaniel Eaton. Interestingly, the university was not always called Harvard. “When it was set up, it was called New College. It was renamed Harvard College after its biggest benefactor, John Harvard,” remarks Sinha. Harvard, on his deathbed, gave to the university his library and estate.

Eaton, however, was quickly dismissed on charges of brutality and physical abuse. The arrival of Cambridge graduate Henry Dunster as the president in 1640 offered a glimmer of hope. “The youngest in the long line of Harvard presidents, he proved to be one of the greatest,” writes alumnus and author Samuel Eliot Morison in Three Centuries of Harvard (1636-1936). His effort was particularly concentrated on completing the college buildings.

By the 1650s, Harvard had about 60 students enrolled. Boys had come from Bermuda, Virginia, New Amsterdam, and even England, where Harvard degrees were now accepted by Oxford and Cambridge as equivalent to their own. A dispute with the administration, unfortunately, led Dunster to resign in 1654. “Harvard University grew out of the Liberal Arts college as Dunster left it,” remarks Morison.

A church college

Academic and student life in the seventeenth-century Harvard was guided by the Catholic Church. A college pamphlet from 1643 states the vision of the College: “To advance learning and perpetuate it to Posterity; dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches.” In other words, a learned clergy was what Harvard was expected to supply.

An average day for a Harvard student began and ended with prayer, which included the recitation of a chapter of Scripture by the President. Saturdays were dedicated to preparations for the Sabbath, which included worship and meditation. Students, according to Morison, were reminded that the focus of their academic pursuit was the greater knowledge of God. It was thus no surprise that Harvard, at the time, was known as the ‘School of Prophets,’ and its men as the ‘Sons of Prophets.’

Eighteenth-century Harvard

The 1700s were a period of prosperity for Harvard. The decade began with the Presidency of John Leverett. His first concern was to refurbish the dilapidated college buildings. Tables, chairs, feather beds, and looking glasses were supplied in abundance. While no major changes were made to the curriculum, the number of student enrollments increased. French was also introduced as a subject. Interestingly, the French tutor was the only staff member without a Harvard degree.

Expulsion was a particularly dreadful process. After assembling the entire college in the hall, the President would announce the crime and sentence. The butler would then strike off the name of the offenders from the bulletin board, which contained the names of all members of the College. However, the culprit could publicly confess their misdeeds and be forgiven as per the Christian principle.

Another notable aspect was that until 1749, classes at Harvard were placed in order of the presumed social rank of parents. However, as classes grew bigger, the process turned complex. In 1769, the decision was made that arrangements would now be alphabetical. Leverett’s leadership helped Harvard grow from a weak institution to one of considerable repute. According to Morison, it was Leverett who founded the liberal tradition of Harvard University.

Discussion on the Harvard of the eighteenth century cannot be without the university’s response to the American Revolution (1775-1783). Experts and accounts claim that Harvard men played a significant part in carrying through the Revolution. Plato’s dialogues and Aristotle’s virtues guided their actions of the time. Morison mentions several public speaking clubs, including the Speaking Club, the Mercurian Club, and the Clintonian Club, were established as secret societies in the College.

Yet, the American Revolutionary War placed the College under difficult circumstances. Students fell in numbers, supplies fell short, and wartime inflation exacerbated the ongoing financial crisis.

War and peace

The dominant feeling at Harvard during the Civil War (1861-1865) was for the Union, which advocated conciliation as well as the abolition of slavery. “Harvard very clearly fought for the Union. A lot of constitutional lawmaking, post the Civil War, was done by Harvard scholars, both ex-students as well as faculty,” says Sinha. Harvard, thus, has had a central role in establishing the legal framework of the country. “And there’s always been dissent.”

However, college went on as usual, and attendance was normal. President Abraham Lincoln kept his son at Harvard at the time, until his graduation in 1864. This was also the century when Harvard expanded significantly. The Medical School, set up in 1782, introduced entrance examinations, and laboratories for Physiology and Microscopic Anatomy were created.

The summer of 1900 also witnessed Harvard open its doors for women. Harvard president Charles William Eliot mentioned the move to make the university gender-inclusive. However, he was cautious to say that Harvard would avoid “the difficulties involved in common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age.”

“There was the Radcliffe College, which was a girls’ college that was associated with Harvard, but it was a separate identity,” explains Sinha. It was only in the 1970s that the college was drafted into Harvard University.

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-astronauts-reach-international-space-station-10059408/,"The launch of the Axiom-4 Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), scheduled for Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, has been postponed due to a technical fault.

The mission will take a crew of four astronauts — American Peggy Whitson, Indian Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungarian Tibor Kapu — to the ISS aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft which will be launched by the company’s Falcon 9 rocket. Shukhla is set to become only the second Indian to venture into space.

What will his journey to the ISS look like? How much time will it take to reach the space station? And once there, how will the Dragon capsule dock with the ISS?

Planning the flight

Before launching any mission to space, scientists first have to first select a launch window, that is, a time slot in which the spacecraft must be launched so it can reach its intended destination, be it a space station like the ISS or a celestial body like the Moon or Mars.

Since everything in space — including the ISS — is in constant motion, it is not viable for a mission to be launched at just any time. Celestial alignment is essential for any mission to be viable. Scientists make complex calculations to ensure that the trajectory of the spacecraft aligns with the trajectory of the intended destination.

In case of missions to the ISS, spacecraft orbit around Earth multiple times to align with the orbit of the space station. Such a trajectory also makes any mission viable in terms of the fuel needed.

If a spacecraft were to travel to its destination in a straight trajectory, it would have to continuously accelerate to counteract gravitational forces, which would be inefficient in terms of the fuel needed.

Spacecraft usually travel in a curved trajectory upon reaching a certain altitude and velocity, which minimises the energy they need to expend to counteract the force of gravity.

The rocket & capsule

Falcon 9 is a partially reusable rocket designed and manufactured by Elon Musk-owned SpaceX. It is used to transport satellites, cargo and the Dragon spacecraft to low Earth orbit (an altitude of 2,000 km or less) and beyond.

The rocket has two stages. The first stage or booster stage comprises nine Merlin engines (a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX), and aluminium-lithium alloy tanks containing liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene propellant. The second stage consists of a single Merlin engine.

After the lift-off, as Falcon-9 reaches the edge of the atmosphere, it typically cuts off its main engines. Once the rocket is beyond the atmosphere, the first stage separates from the second stage.

Story continues below this ad

While the first stage re-enters the atmosphere and lands vertically, the second stage continues its journey towards the targeted orbit with the help of its Merlin engine. Soon after, the Dragon capsule separates from the second stage.

Dragon’s path to the ISS

Given that the ISS is 400 km above Earth and is a moving target at the speed of about 28,000 kmph, the Dragon spacecraft has to raise its altitude gradually, and align its trajectory with the space station.

The spacecraft does so by performing a series of phasing manoeuvres — they enable the Dragon to change its orbit — with the help of 16 Draco thrusters. Each thruster is capable of generating 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.

Note that while the Dragon spacecraft typically takes 28 hours to reach from the launchpad to the ISS, other spacecraft such as Russia’s Soyuz take up to just eight hours to cover the same journey.

Story continues below this ad

One of the reasons why the Dragon is slower is that it is a relatively newer spacecraft (it was first launched in 2012) compared to, let’s say, Soyuz, which has a long and proven flight history. SpaceX is still in the process of developing mathematical models for optimal start time and phasing manoeuvres.

Due to this, astronauts aboard the Dragon conduct multiple tests of all the spacecraft’s systems and collect and transmit data about its operation to Earth which makes its rendezvous time longer.

The docking

When the Dragon capsule gets close enough to the ISS, it establishes communication with the space station and performs its final phase manoeuvre. Then, the spacecraft enters an imaginary 200 metres bubble around the ISS known as the “keep-out sphere”, and aligns with the space station’s docking port. At this point, the Dragon capsule initiates its autonomous docking system and slowly moves towards the ISS to finally dock with it. This happens while both are moving at great speeds but are almost at rest relative to each other.

The spacecraft carries out autonomous docking with the help of GPS sensors, cameras and imaging sensors such as Lidar (laser ranging) on its nosecone. All these sensors feed data back to the flight computer which then uses algorithms that determine — based on this information — how to fire the thrusters to most effectively get to the docking target. If needed, the astronauts on board can also take over manual control of the spacecraft.

After the docking is done, it takes between one and two hours for the spacecraft to stabilise and carry out safety checks. Subsequently, transfer gates are opened, and astronauts enter the ISS.",Science
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/meghalaya-murder-sonams-story-from-mba-dreams-to-sanskari-bahu-to-murder-accused-10059369/,"Sonam Raghuvanshi, the 24-year-old Indore resident arrested in connection with the murder of her husband Raja Raghuvanshi (28), once harboured dreams of getting an MBA degree, expanding her father’s plywood business, and breaking out of the regimented life set by her family.

Today, she stands accused of conspiring with Raj Kushwaha (21), whom police believe she was in a relationship with, to hire contract killers to murder Raja while they were on their honeymoon.

Sonam grew up in the narrow bylanes of Indore’s Kushwah Nagar, where her father, Devi Singh Raghuvanshi, had built a plywood business over 25 years after arriving from nearby Guna with limited resources. Her family said she is a graduate and claimed she played a role in expanding her father’s business.

Story continues below this ad

Growing up a girl in a small town, her father says, the family kept a check on her movements and associations from a young age. “We never allowed our daughter to go out of the home and talk to random people,” Devi Singh said. “She lived a strict life. Her life was only work and home.”

Her family discouraged her from pursuing work outside their sphere, so she remained within the confines of the plywood factory operations.

The family’s financial situation had improved considerably over the years, expanding into Gujarat under her brother Govind’s management. But this prosperity came with increased restrictions on Sonam’s personal freedom. “She once mentioned wanting to pursue an MBA, but this was quietly shelved when her family made it clear that her place was within their business operations,” said a senior Madhya Pradesh police officer.

It was during this time that Sonam first encountered Raj, a man who had previously worked in the billing department of her father’s factory and lived in the same neighbourhood. Their interaction was initially limited to routine business transactions, but the relationship would develop beyond her family’s knowledge or approval. Her family members maintain they had no inkling of the relationship, and claim the police are lying.

When the time came for marriage, the arrangement followed traditional protocols. The match with Raja Raghuvanshi was initiated through the Samaj Parichay Pustika, a community matrimonial directory published during Ram Navami on October 1, 2024. There was no prior acquaintance between the families; only biodata that appeared compatible.

Raja belonged to a family that operated Raghuvanshi Transport, a business providing rental buses to educational institutions. As the youngest of three brothers, he was involved in the family enterprise, and considered the match providential when the same proposal resurfaced after his family had initially declined it over a year earlier, Raja’s mother Uma said.

“We were not in a hurry to get our son married. They wanted the marriage to be done in four months. We did not think much of it. She was a sanskari bahu who observed a fast for my son, did not speak much to the family and came down from the top floor to eat her meals. She was on her phone most of the time, and we never intervened. We wanted her to have all the freedom she could enjoy. Her father would not even allow her to watch a movie,” Uma said.

The wedding took place on May 11, but relatives later recalled that Sonam appeared “subdued” during the ceremonies.

Initially, there had been no family discussion about a post-wedding trip, but she allegedly expressed a desire to travel. When Raja initially declined, she persisted, eventually booking tickets herself and convincing him to accompany her to Meghalaya, investigators from the state said.

Sonam had booked departure tickets but made no arrangements for their return journey. She also convinced Raja to wear expensive jewellery during their travel, despite his mother’s objections at the airport. “That was the only time Sonam was demanding. She was a quiet, nice woman from the neighbourhood who did not do anything malicious. I spoke to Sonam’s mother and said I still can’t believe it. They said they did not know anything about Raj Kushwaha and were offended he appeared at my son’s funeral. It seems they did not know much about their daughter,” Uma said.",Entertainment
https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/type-5-diabetes-category-top-diabetologists-question-lack-evidence-data-10058098/,"Top endocrinologists have questioned the way Malnutrition-Related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM) has been hastily rechristened as Type 5 diabetes by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

In an expert review, Dr Anoop Misra (chairman, Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences), Dr Ambrish Mithal (chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes at Max Healthcare) and Dr Shashank Joshi (diabetologist, Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai) have argued that the new classification runs ahead without robust modern evidence or clearly defined diagnostic criteria. Their critical analysis was published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews recently. “Reclassifying MRDM as Type 5 diabetes is premature and not supported by current evidence,” they wrote.

They argue that MRDM, though first recognised in 1985, was declassified in 1999 due to poor evidence. They say the same holds true today as overlapping symptoms continue to be misleading, the body mass index (BMI) criteria are considered outdated and there is not enough data to warrant a separate type of diabetes. “We still need rigorous research and definitive biomarkers for such a classification. Besides, there has to be a global consensus,” says Dr Misra. Excerpts:

Why can’t MRDM be classified as Type 5 diabetes?

Story continues below this ad

There’s no conclusive evidence that MRDM is a distinct disease rather than a variant or complication of existing diabetes types. Only a distinct phenotype (traits which define the ‘what’ of a disease) with robust data different from established types merits new classification.

MRDM overlaps with other types of diabetes — type 1 (due to autoimmune markers in some cases), type 2 (with insulin resistance or secretory defects), and secondary diabetes (when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough digestive enzymes).

There’s inadequate evidence. Only a few, small-scale studies, such as the 2022 study by Lontchi-Yimagou, exist. Rest are 25-40 year old data, some of which is mostly clinical. These studies are largely cross-sectional and limited in scope, sample size and generalizability. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and WHO have never formally acknowledged type 3 or type 4 diabetes, making the proposal of a “type 5” both arbitrary, confusing and unacceptable.

What’s needed for a classification?

A valid classification demands a clearly distinct cause or causes, well-defined diagnostic criteria, international consensus and therapeutic utility. MRDM does not currently satisfy these requirements.

Did MRDM ever receive the attention it deserved?

Story continues below this ad

The WHO classified it as a separate category in 1985 and it was discussed in international diabetes forums such as the 1976 IDF Congress. However, this attention waned due to the poor quality and limited quantity of research, which was largely descriptive and observational. Eventually, the WHO removed MRDM from its classification in 1999, citing insufficient evidence. In India, MRDM has become increasingly rare. Many experts report not encountering it at all, suggesting its relevance has significantly declined.

Should MRDM be treated as a type or a subset of diabetes?

MRDM is best viewed not as a separate type of diabetes but as a subset or modified form of existing types, most likely falling under secondary diabetes or as a variant of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This type is influenced by factors such as chronic undernutrition. Defining it as a distinct “type” risks oversimplification and could introduce unnecessary confusion in diagnosis and management.

What is the classification’s impact in India?

India historically played a major role in defining and reporting MRDM, contributing to a significant volume of early literature. But MRDM was also reported from many other tropical countries. However, current data reveal a steep decline in the prevalence of undernutrition (proxy by BMI). For instance, thinness among women aged 20–54 dropped from 31.7% in 1999 to 14.2% in 2021.

Story continues below this ad

Moreover, many individuals with low BMI in India are constitutionally thin and not necessarily malnourished or unhealthy. Reintroducing MRDM as a major category today risks diverting clinical attention and public health resources away from the pressing and widespread problem of type 2 diabetes, which remains the dominant and surging diabetes burden in India.

What more evidence is needed?

We need large-scale, prospective cohort studies with long-term follow-up; detailed nutritional, immunological and metabolic profiling; insulin secretion and sensitivity assessments using gold-standard methods; standardized malnutrition definitions; and comprehensive genetic research. Without this evidence base, the proposal to reclassify MRDM is premature, unsubstantiated and unacceptable.

How does Type 5 classification hamper treatment protocol?

Classifying MRDM as “Type 5 diabetes” may introduce more confusion than clarity. It suggests a degree of diagnostic and therapeutic precision that does not exist. Moreover, such a label does not provide actionable clinical guidance, as patients show variable insulin needs and mixed autoimmune markers. It could also mislead policymakers and healthcare providers, diverting attention and funding from more prevalent and well-characterized diabetes forms such as type 2.",Science
https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/drone-warfare-came-home-during-op-sindoor-where-does-india-stand-10061470/,"On July 1, 2021, then Army Chief General M M Naravane had warned: “While we pursue our quest for niche technologies, including AI, it would be prudent to remember that future wars will also involve low technology, which is easy to obtain but difficult to defeat.”

These words ring truer than ever in the context of two recent events.

On June 1, Ukraine bombed five airbases deep inside Russia using cheap First Person View (FPV) drones, underlining the need to fundamentally reimagine air defences in the age of asymmetric drone warfare.

Story continues below this ad

Weeks earlier in May, during the hostilities in the wake of Operation Sindoor, Pakistan had attacked towns and military facilities across India’s western front, from Baramulla to Barmer, with swarm after swarm of relatively low cost, low tech drones for four straight days. Apart from inflicting damage, these attacks were meant to overwhelm India’s air defences, clutter radars, exhaust ammunition, gather intelligence, and probe for vulnerabilities.

Drones, a brief history

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) date back to World War II and the Korean War, where they were used for training anti-aircraft gunners and in specific offensive missions. Their modern military usage took off in the 1990s, after being successfully deployed in the Gulf War of 1991.

The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict of 2020 marked a turning point in drone warfare: Azerbaijan’s use of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Israeli Harop drones devastated Armenian defences, decisively shifting the conflict’s dynamics in favour of Baku.

Story continues below this ad

Since then, drones have played a key role in:

🔴 Yemen, where Houthi rebels targeted Saudi oil infrastructure using drone swarms;

🔴 Gaza, where Israel has deployed high-tech drones for surveillance and strikes, and Hamas has used drones for grenades and observation; and

🔴 Ukraine, where both Moscow and Kyiv have deployed commercial quadcopters (DJI drones), military drones (Bayraktar TB2, Orlan-10, Shahed-136), and loitering munitions.

Ukraine has notably used “first-person view” (FPV) racing drones to target tanks, chase individual soldiers and small units, and, most notably, bomb Russian air bases.

Story continues below this ad

On June 1, Ukraine carried out Operation Spider’s Web, one of the most sophisticated drone operations in history, using 100–150 FPV drones, transported clandestinely in trucks deep into Russia. The target: five key Russian airfields. Ukrainian officials claim to have hit more than 40 Russian aircraft, including strategic bombers like the Tu-22 and Tu-95, and inflicted losses of around $7 billion.

Meanwhile, Russia throughout the war has used Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones in swarms to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, and target critical infrastructure such as energy grids.

Not one, not two…

Swarm drones are autonomous or semi-autonomous UAVs that operate in coordinated groups, much like swarms of birds or fish. They communicate via wireless networks and adjust in real time to achieve shared objectives.

Swarms are more resilient than traditional drones due to in-built redundancy — even if one drone is intercepted, others can continue on the mission. Drone swarms are thus used to saturate air defences (a few payloads may sneak through even robust defences), gathering intelligence, and attacking high-value targets.

Story continues below this ad

Countries are already developing even more lethal AI-driven swarm drones, capable of making real-time decisions, adapting tactics mid-mission, and coordinating more complex manoeuvres. These are expected to become integral to combined arms warfare, functioning alongside infantry, armour, and cyber units.

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global military drone market stood at $14.14 billion in 2023, and is projected to hit $47.16 billion by 2032.

Threat of swarms

Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, in a lecture in Pune, flagged the rising drone threat: “Now we have drones as small as water bottles — and in swarms,” he said, calling these “undetectable” and “untargetable”.

Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), former head of the Centre for Air Power Studies, said that while drone swarms deployed by Pakistan were not particularly effective, the Ukraine example offers some major learnings.

Story continues below this ad

“When you use very cheap drones that carry warheads barely weighing a kilo — like Pakistan did — nothing much happens. They’re jammed easily… Only a fool would fire expensive missiles at them,” Chopra told The Indian Express.

But swarm drone attacks can be carried out anywhere, and at any time. “If someone moves a truck full of drones near an airbase and launches them [like in the case of Op Spider’s Web], defending becomes very difficult. In countries like India, with porous borders and diverse populations, the threat is real,” he said.

Chopra emphasised upon the need for integration across the security establishment.

“Your intelligence setup, even the local police, matter. Even a traffic constable could make a difference,” he said, adding that the success of the Ukraine op was predicated on Kyiv being able to transport its drones thousands of kilometres inside Russia undetected.

“Strategic thinking, inventory management — everything must evolve. A $1,000 drone damaging a $200 million aircraft is our new reality,” Chopra said.

Countering drone threats

Defence against drones begins with detection. Modern systems employ a mix of AESA radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, acoustic detectors, and AI-powered fusion systems.

Once detected, one option is for drones to be neutralised through kinetic means, that is, with missiles and anti-aircraft guns. But traditional kinetic air defences, especially surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), are costly, and less effective against swarms. Automated gun systems such as C-RAM and Phalanx, which track targets and fire autonomously, are preferred in this role.

Even more cost-effective alternatives include:

Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs): Lasers and microwave pulses that disable drones by damaging sensors or frying electronics;

Electronic Warfare (EW): Jamming GPS signals or communication links;

Story continues below this ad

Spoofing: Misleading drones about their location or issuing false commands;

Cyber Attacks: Taking control of drones and crash them by exploiting software vulnerabilities; and

Interceptor drones & nets: For close-range neutralisation, protecting critical assets.

The asymmetry in cost remains the central challenge in anti-drone warfare. A drone swarm costing roughly $100,000 might take millions of dollars to neutralise with currently available technology. This is why nations, including India, are investing in more cost-effective solutions like EW and DEWs.

Story continues below this ad

The ideal defence is a layered system, integrating multiple modes of interception for redundancy and cost-efficiency purposes. Examples include Israel’s Iron Dome and the US’s Directed Energy M-SHORAD.

India’s capabilities

Since 2020, India has ramped up its counter-drone infrastructure, deploying a layered defence that blends indigenous technology, EW, and air defence systems. Key systems include:

Akashteer Air Defence Control System: Developed by Bharat Electronics Ltd, it integrates with the Indian Air Force’s integrated command network for real-time tracking;

Bhargavastra: Solar Defence and Aerospace Ltd’s weapon system fires 64 micro-rockets in salvos to eliminate drone swarms;

DRDO’s Anti-Drone System: It offers 360-degree radar coverage, with both jamming (soft kill) and laser (hard kill) capabilities. Drones can be detected up to 4 km away, and neutralised within a 1 km radius; and

Indrajaal: An AI-powered grid from a Hyderabad startup that combines jammers, spoofers, and intelligence to protect areas up to 4,000 sq km. Already deployed at naval sites in Gujarat and Karnataka.

During the May 2025 swarm attacks, the IAF activated its Integrated Counter-UAS Grid, alongside conventional radars, guns, and missiles, neutralising attempted strikes on 15 military bases and several urban targets.

Looking ahead

There is currently a race to develop both drone and anti-drone capabilities. “Even the Iranians are producing more than 20 Shahed drones per day. And these are powerful. India too has set up an ecosystem with 550 startups in the field. Some tech is acquired, but we’re developing our own tech too,” Chopra said.

The future of warfare is here, and it’s unmanned, AI-driven and asymmetric. India’s response to the May 2025 drone swarms signals it is rapidly adapting to this future.

As CDS Chauhan put it: “We are at a cusp where war may be between humans and machines — and tomorrow, between machines themselves. Machines that are autonomous, intelligent, and make decisions. We may need a layered and resilient defence system [to counter] this.”

Police have arrested four people and said they are carrying out raids to arrest more people responsible for the violence.

According to police, the clash between the two groups began over a dispute involving a temporary shop in the Rabindranagar area of Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas district, bordering Kolkata. Soon, it spread to Nadiyal, which falls under Kolkata Police jurisdiction.

“Five police personnel have been injured, including one SDPO-ranked official, one Inspector, three sub-Inspectors, and one ASI. Four persons have been arrested,” DIG (Presidency Range) Akash Magharia told The Indian Express.

A senior police officer said on Wednesday noon that a youth from Nadiyal found that the place in Rabindranagar area, where he had not set up his shop for the past few days, had a Tulsi plant. “His attempt to reclaim the area led to an initial scuffle between two groups. Soon, a large group of people was called in from Nadiyal, leading to a clash between the two groups. Initially, police tried to calm down the situation, but it escalated with stone pelting in the area. Some shops were also vandalised,” the officer told The Indian Express.

Around 3:30, the situation further flared up in Nadiyal, which falls under the Kolkata Police jurisdiction and is nearly 500 metres from Rabindranagar police station under Diamond Harbour Police District in South 24 Parganas.

“A mob burnt motorbikes, police vehicles. Policemen got injured too. Though there were no serious injuries to anyone,” a senior police officer said.

Police said they lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to lathi charge to disperse the mob involved in stone pelting.

“The situation is normal in Rabindranagar area now. Four persons have been arrested, and raids are continuing. There will be many arrests subsequently,” ADG (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim said.

Amid a large deployment of police personnel and Rapid Action Force team, prohibitory orders have been put in place in the area.

Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP demanded deployment of Central forces and accused the TMC government of “Muslim appeasement”.

Union Minister and West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar reacted strongly to the incident, blaming the state government for “Muslim appeasement”. “Despite knowing the culprits, the police acted against the victims instead of the aggressors,” Majumdar alleged, accusing the TMC government of “ignoring repeated attacks on Bengali Hindus in Muslim-majority areas” of the state.

Leader of Opposition in Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, who sat on a dharna outside Bhawani Bhavan, the state police headquarters, said: “This is complete failure of the administration and police. Central paramilitary forces should be deployed at Maheshtala immediately… The Hindu community in Rabindranagar has been subjected to looting, arson, and violence for hours while the police watched silently. Several police vehicles were set on fire, yet there was no effective intervention.”

He also claimed that DGP Rajiv Kumar refused to meet him.

“Despite such grave attacks on police, the top brass seems indifferent. I will move Calcutta High Court tomorrow seeking urgent intervention and central forces, as ordered earlier during communal tension in Murshidabad,” the BJP leader said.

Both leaders also urged Governor CV Ananda Bose to intervene, alleging the incident reflected systemic administrative failure. “The Governor must step in to ensure that constitutional order is upheld and justice is delivered to the affected Hindu community,” Majumdar said.

https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/buzz-jayant-patils-exit-ncpsp-faces-race-replace-him-10061241/,"At the 26th foundation day celebrations of his party Tuesday, Maharashtra NCP(SP) president Jayant Patil created a stir as he offered to resign from his post for the second time within a year claiming “the opportunity to lead the party should be given to a new face”.

Even as Patil’s statement saw an uproar from party workers, unlike last time, it has triggered speculations about his successor and possible exit from the NCP(SP) after the party’s patriarch Sharad Pawar indicated that it would “look for new faces to lead”.

In his address, Pawar did not insist that Patil continue in his post and also did not praise his leadership, merely saying, “I will sit and discuss the issue (of electing a new state president) with prominent leaders of the party. We will take a collective decision. We want to ensure that a new face leads the party in every district and taluka. We will work to create a new generation of party workers and leaders across the state.”

Pawar’s comments have led a section of NCP(SP) leaders to believe that Patil may not stay in the party if he steps down. “The doors of the BJP are open for him (Jayant Patil). Evidence to this is Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s frequent praise of Patil on the floor of the Assembly. He may join the BJP or the (Ajit Pawar-led) NCP,” an NCP(SP) leader said on the condition of anonymity.

However, veteran NCP leader Ankush Kakde, who is seen to be close to Sharad Pawar, claimed there was “no immediate worry about leadership”. “I think Patil will be at the helm till the (upcoming) civic polls,” he said.

Meanwhile, Pawar’s announcement has put the spotlight on the NCP(SP)’s young leaders like former ministers Jitendra Awhad, Rajesh Tope and Shashikant Shinde, Lok Sabha MP Amol Kolhe and Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar, who are seen to be in the running to replace Patil.

Key contenders

Rohit and Patil have had strained ties. In June last year, at the party’s foundation day event, Rohit was the first leader to target Patil over issues concerning the party’s functioning.

While reprimanding Rohit for raking up such issues publicly, Patil had then offered to quit as state president, saying he would remain in the post only till the Assembly elections (held in November 2024). However, Rohit offered an olive branch and said he had no intention to lead the party and subsequently “praised” Patil’s work.

Though this time there are hardly any dissenting voices against Patil, sources said one of the key reasons for him offering to quit his post are the number of Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases against him, like the one over his alleged involvement in the IF&FS scam. Since the ED’s summons to Patil in 2023, the IF&FS case has not moved forward. Sources in the BJP said that “Patil’s amicable relations with Fadnavis have worked to his advantage”.

Awhad, on the other hand, is seen to be close to Pawar Senior as well as Baramati MP Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter. Seen as strong voice which takes on the ruling Mahayuti strongly over various issues, the OBC leader is seen to have made a place for himself among the Maratha community for his attacks on former minister Dhananjay Munde and his supporters over the murder of Massajog sarpanch Sanjay Deshmukh.

Another frontrunner in the reckoning to replace Patil, Shashikant Shinde is an MLC, who had been an MLA from Satara district several times. He lost narrowly to the BJP’s Udayanraje Bhosale from the Satara Lok Sabha seat in last year’s polls.

https://indianexpress.com/article/business/alarm-bells-in-textile-recycling-hub-panipat-over-suspension-of-bangladesh-rags-supply-10061508/,"Traders and manufacturers in Panipat, India’s largest textile recycling hub that receives discarded clothing from multiple countries for recycling and resale, have raised concerns over the suspension of shipments from Bangladesh, the top source of rags for recycling in India, The Indian Express has learnt.

“Rags and recycled items were not part of the restriction on garments through the land border route that the government announced in May. Traders in Panipat are complaining that the shipments from Bangladesh have been halted but it is unclear why this step has been taken,” a person aware of the development said.

While traders plan to raise the issue with the government, they remain unsure about the reason for the halt in exports. But the development comes amid heightened trade tensions between India and Bangladesh after Dhaka’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus called for the extension of the Chinese economy around the strategically important North-East India region.

This assumes significance as over 200 tonnes of rags are recycled in Panipat every day, with 150-200 mills operating in the sector. Their key sources of rags include discarded clothing from Western countries, but Bangladesh alone generates over 0.5 million metric tonnes of textile waste from its factories each year.

The suspension of exports of rags and textile waste coincides with Bangladesh’s attempts at seeking Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status in the European Union, which would result in the removal of tariffs on over 66 per cent of EU tariff lines. The EU is one of Bangladesh’s biggest export markets, but the country is set to lose concessions in 2026 after graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status.

To qualify for the GSP+ scheme, Bangladesh must enhance its domestic recycling capabilities and meet specific conditions related to labour rights and governance.

According to news agency Reuters, increased local recycling could save Bangladesh around $700 million annually in import costs, as several countries, including India, ramp up their textile recycling capacities. India recycles or reuses approximately 4.7 million tonnes, or about 60 per cent, of its textile waste.

Political and economic tensions between India and its largest trade partner in South Asia have been growing, especially as the Union government in May imposed a series of import restrictions on goods from Bangladesh, particularly on ready-made garments, the country’s largest export item and a key source of foreign exchange.

This followed earlier signs of deteriorating ties, including New Delhi’s decision in April to terminate the five-year-old transhipment facility for Bangladesh’s export cargo – a mechanism that enabled Dhaka to ship goods to several Western countries using Indian land routes and airports.

Notably, Bangladesh also imposed port restrictions on Indian yarn exports via land ports, allowing such exports only through seaports. This move, an official said, was ostensibly in response to demands from Bangladeshi textile mills – despite the fact that the land route offers the quickest and most cost-effective yarn supply to the ready-made garments industry in Bangladesh.

Yarn exports to Bangladesh account for 20 per cent of India’s total exports to the country, which were valued at $11.38 billion in FY25. Official data showed that cotton yarn and handloom product exports to Dhaka stood at $2.39 billion during the last financial year. Meanwhile, India imports ready-made garments from Bangladesh valued at over $700 million annually.",World

On the morning of May 31, residents of The Crown Greens Society, a high-rise building in Hinjewadi, found Kothimbire’s body on the society premises around 7 am and alerted the police. An accidental death report was registered at the Hinjewadi police station.

According to the police investigation, CCTV footage shows that Kothimbire arrived at the society on her two-wheeler at around 4.38 am on May 31. She allegedly jumped from the 21st floor and was found dead hours later. Her vehicle was found in the society’s parking lot, which helped police confirm her identity.

Hinjewadi police station’s Senior Police Inspector Kanhaiya Thorat said, “She was found dead on the morning of May 31. We have found a suicide note, and further investigation is on.” However, the suicide note did not mention any specific reason for her decision.

The family of the software engineer has alleged that work pressure and toxic work culture drove her to take the extreme step. The deceased was a native of Shrigonda in Ahilyanagar (formerly Ahmednagar) district, and was working as an engineer at an IT company on Senapati Bapat Road.

Kothimbire’s cousin, Shashi Raykar, speaking to The Indian Express, said that Abhilasha had been struggling with work pressure and workplace-related stress for the past few months, which allegedly led to her suicide.

“Immediately after graduation, she joined as a full-stack engineer in Hinjewadi but was kept on the bench for around two years, so she couldn’t get hands-on experience,” Raykar explained. This forced her to change the job in October last year.

In the new role as a front-end developer, it was difficult to adapt. “She was suffering from constant work pressure to learn new softwares. The workload was so huge that it led her to work for long hours. Overtime had become a daily thing, and Abhilasha would keep weekends for learning the new technology,” added Raykar.

“As a result, in the last few months, Abhilasha lost weight, and her enthusiasm reduced. This affected her drive and energy, gradually leading to depression. She would say that the work environment was toxic and the staff wasn’t cooperative, and she was fed up with them. This forced her to purposely opt for work-from-home mode throughout May,” said Raykar.

Adding to her troubles were fears about job security. “Some of her company’s projects had been transferred to another IT firm, and she had said there was talk about layoffs. Abhilasha feared she was on that list and if removed might have created financial pressure as she had gifted a car to her father three months ago and was paying the EMIs,” he added.

Despite her struggles, Kothimbire’s last conversation with her parents on the evening of May 30 did not indicate her intentions. “She seemed happy, and the conversation didn’t mention any workload or company issues. The family was also discussing and planning to get her married,” Raykar added.

Her friend Suresh (name changed), the last person she called on May 30, said, “She used to regularly complain about her workload. The evening before, she was frustrated and mentioned that she couldn’t sustain the work stress now and called me to take her out. While roaming around her home in Hinjewadi I advised her to take a break, told her that work pressure would be over gradually and left her back to her flat at around 9 pm,” he said.

“She travelled to the high-rise Crown Greens Society from her flat in a four-storey building, and jumped off from the 21st floor through the open space near the staircase,” Raykar said.

In response to the allegations, the Human Resource (HR) head, where Abhilasha was working, told The Indian Express, “We are a mid-sized company where targets are not forced upon. Also, with a good employee retention rate we do not have any complaints about work pressure in the last 18 years of the company’s existence. While Abhilasha was a well-performing employee, we never had any complaints or arguments with her in the last eight months of her joining.”

“Emphasising work-life balance we had given her leaves whenever she needed. From about mid-April she chose the work-from-home option citing medical reasons of B12 deficiency and others and we allowed it without imposing conditions or extra work. Though some of the projects have been transferred to different IT firms, it’s routine in the IT sector and there were no discussions about layoffs. Any allegations made about toxic work culture and work-related stress are baseless,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Thorat, said, “The investigation is progressing. If the family of the deceased allege and complain to us that any kind of work pressure led to the suicide, we will inquire with company officials and take appropriate action.”",Politics
https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-essentials/how-indias-development-centric-approach-to-central-asia-marks-a-shift-10060989/,"Amid shifting dynamics in and around the Central Asian region – marked by Iran’s entry into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS, and the Taliban’s growing engagement with China, Iran, and now India – new opportunities are emerging for India to deepen its engagement with Central Asian Republics (CARs), especially in the development sector.

Notably, the development sector emerged as the primary focus of discussions during the fourth meeting of the India-Central Asia Dialogue. This signals a departure from the earlier narrative between India and the region, which was largely dominated by Central Asian geopolitics, the new Great Game, oil and gas deals, and pipeline routes.

The Dialogue, chaired by India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and attended by the Foreign Ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, proved to be a valuable opportunity to showcase India’s developmental strengths and the potential for linking them to Central Asia.

Story continues below this ad

Let’s examine India’s development-centric approach to the region, which has become noticeable in recent years, and explore how the India–Central Asia Dialogue evolved as a strategic tool for New Delhi.

How India-Central Asia ties evolved

Central Asia has long been part of the Indian imagination due to historical civilisational linkages and cultural connections. After the Soviet Union break-up, new geopolitical realities and economic opportunities influenced India’s approach to the region. The emergence of new independent states opened opportunities for energy imports as well as trade and transit.

At the same time, concerns over rising religious fundamentalism, instability in Afghanistan and China’s growing profile in the region further heightened India’s strategic interest.

After signing strategic partnerships with Kazakhstan (2009), Uzbekistan (2011) and Tajikistan (2012), India announced its 12-point ‘Connect Central Asia’ policy in 2012. The aim was to look at the region collectively in a more proactive manner and strengthen India’s political, security, economic and cultural connections.

Story continues below this ad

In July 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited all five Central Asian states and signed 22 agreements. India’s engagement deepened further when it became a full member of the SCO in 2017 and initiated the foreign minister-level ‘India–Central Asia Dialogue’ in 2019. The same year, India elevated relations with Kyrgyzstan to a strategic partnership.

Deepening connectivity

Despite close political and strategic ties with all Central Asian countries, India’s commercial engagement with the region has remained limited. An unstable Afghanistan and strained India–Pakistan relations have obstructed direct connectivity. To address these challenges, New Delhi sought alternative routes by working with Russia and Iran through the International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and its tributaries. Investments in Afghan infrastructure was also part of this broader strategy.

The construction of the 218 km Zaranj–Delaram road in Afghanistan and the development of Chabahar Port in Iran were key initiatives aimed at facilitating India’s access to Central Asia via Iran and Afghanistan’s ring road. India’s connectivity plans coincided with the US New Silk Road Initiative to connect Central Asia with South Asia via Afghanistan. The Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) gas pipeline project also remained a key focus for many years.

However, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the return of the Taliban disrupted all these earlier narratives. In the meantime, China has expanded its presence in the region through trade and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are also part of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union.

Development cooperation and capacity building

In this evolving regional context, development cooperation and capacity building have become central to India’s engagement with Central Asia. To support this shift, India has established the India–Central Asia Development Group and the India–Central Asia Business Council. Additionally, a US$1 billion line of credit was launched to fund development projects in infrastructure, IT, energy, and agriculture.

At the recent India-Central Asia Business Council, EAM Jaishankar outlined five key areas to strengthen linkages between the growing Indian economy and Central Asia. These included digital economy and innovation, financial services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, enhancing connectivity, and streamlining transit procedures.

The outcome of the Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue also included the establishment of the India–Central Asia Digital Partnership Forum and India’s offer of technical support for designing Universal Health Coverage (UHC) models in Central Asia. The Central Asian partners further agreed to work closely with India’s Global South Centre of Excellence – DAKSHIN (Development and Knowledge Sharing Initiative), to exchange and learn from each other’s development experiences.

India has also offered to share its Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) platforms, such as Aadhaar and DigiLocker, with Central Asian Countries.

Tapping energy, minerals, and tourism potential

However, due to challenges related to direct connectivity and customs procedures, India’s trade with Central Asia has remained limited to around US$2 billion in recent years. To strengthen these ties, it has been suggested to develop long-term cooperation in uranium, crude oil, gas, mining, coal, and fertilizers, along with facilitating payments in local currencies.

Additionally, tourism and education have been identified as high-potential sectors for future growth. India imports significant quantities of uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. During the meeting, Central Asian partners expressed interest in jointly exploring rare earth minerals.

https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/adah-sharma-on-diet-journey-nepotism-the-kerala-story-playing-a-dead-bird-10056520/,"Adah Sharma has been in the film industry for 17 years, but as she puts it, “it feels like 105”. From her breakout role in 1920 to the blockbuster The Kerala Story, Adah Sharma has quietly carved a space for herself in an industry often accused of gatekeeping. In this candid interview, she talks about the long haul, criticism over controversial roles, her diet staples, what keeps her grounded (spoiler: millet dosas and squirrel sightings), and why she’s not here to promote nepotism. Read the edited excerpts below:

Adah Sharma: It feels like 105 years, honestly. From 1920 in 2008 to now in 2025. But all my bones are still intact!

Q: Has your career trajectory turned out how you dreamed it would?

Adah Sharma: I didn’t even know I was allowed to dream this big as an outsider. I definitely couldn’t have imagined being where I am today.

Story continues below this ad

Q: The Kerala Story has become your most prominent film. How was the experience?

Adah Sharma: Traumatic, exhausting, and at the same time, very fulfilling. We had no idea it would become so big. Thanks to the audience. Even a year later, people come up to me and talk about specific scenes with so much emotion. It’s nice to know we could transport them into the story. Their insights and understanding of scenes and my performance are so touching.

Q: The film also faced heavy criticism and controversy, was likened to hate speech, and was even called a blatant lie. How did you handle it?

Adah Sharma: I thought everyone would stand against terrorism, and rape, and support a film about girls being forced into it. I understand now why some people had a problem with it and called it a lie. A lot of people react in certain ways because of their political affiliations. For me, the film is about the plight of girls being forced to become suicide bombers. The backlash had started 10 days before the release. But once people watched the film, the love we received drowned out the disapproval from those who didn’t even watch it.

Q: Did the negativity affect your mental health?

Adah Sharma: Not really. If criticism comes from people who haven’t even watched the film and are just reacting politically, I don’t take it seriously. I’m grateful I live in a country where women like me are free to act, travel, dress how we like, and where even my critics are allowed to openly make very personalised hate remarks against me publicly, and others are allowed to say they love the film. Freedom of thought and speech is very important for me. Our film did get banned, though, in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.

Q: Do you feel the industry has given you your due, especially as an outsider?

Adah Sharma: There are several projects where I feel I have gotten my due. My debut in 1920 – I believe it was the role of a lifetime! To get to do all those crazy things in my very first film. The Kerala Story, Bastar, Sunflower season 2, and my latest release, Reeta Sanyal, where I got to play 10 characters in one show. I think I’m very fortunate. In Telugu as well, from my debut Heart Attack, which I still get so much love for. That said, I also think nepotism is doing very well and doesn’t need me to promote it.

(Express photo by Dilip Kagda)

Q: What’s the most challenging part about being an actor today?

Adah Sharma: Being misquoted for clickbait headlines, and answering those ‘what would you steal from someone’s closet’ and ‘who would you like to be marooned on an island with?’ questions. They give me severe anxiety. I start thinking, how long will we be on the island? What’s the sleeping situation? Do we bathe in the ocean? What do we do for food? Am I responsible for the other humans’ safety since I got them there? The list goes on.

Q. You seem to be a person with many talents, including knowing all the elements of the periodic table by heart. But what is that one thing not many people know about you?

Adah Sharma: Just like the X-ray machine can see the bones, I can read people’s minds. Very, very clearly.

Q. What is the most challenging thing you have done for a role?

Adah Sharma: I used to practice playing a dead bird when we shot 1920. There is a scene where I eat a raccoon and then run and lie down like a dead bird. Birds, when they die, harden up. So I used to lie in contorted positions around the house, as still as I could, and hold my breath.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Adah Sharma (@adah_ki_adah)

Q. What does your daily diet entail?

Adah Sharma: It’s different every day. Rice is a staple, so are idlis and dosas. We make millet dosas when I’m home, so there’s quinoa or raagi dosas. Also, seeds are a big part of my diet, especially when I travel. Pumpkin and sunflower seeds are high in protein and antioxidants. I’ve been a pure vegetarian since birth, and I don’t eat onions.

Q. You are playing a goddess in your upcoming release. Do you not fear backlash from the audience, since religion has always been a sensitive topic in India?

Adah Sharma: In Hinduism, Devi resides in every woman, so I think the film’s presentation will please the viewers.

Q. You are pretty active on social media. Is it something you do out of will, or is it something your profession demands of you?

Adah Sharma: I definitely use it out of will, and I think the randomness of my feed is proof. I like sharing random stuff from my life: a squirrel who comes to my house, a flower that grew in my garden, the BTS of how a shoot actually took place. I’m lucky the audience has embraced that. It feels natural and unforced.",Entertainment

https://timesascent.com/articles/map-to-boost-women-workforce-this-week,"Labour and employment secretary Sumita Dawra-led committee on enhancing female labour force participation in India is expected to submit its report this week, laying out a blueprint for the government and the private sector to hire more women.

The roadmap will have multidimensional recommendations focussing on targeted interventions to incentivise hiring of women, enable creation of adequate support infrastructure, enhance flexible work policies and put greater emphasis on skilling of women to prepare them for high-skill jobs, a senior government official told ET. The government intends to enhance female labour force participation in the country to 70% by 2047 as against 41.7% in 2023-24.

“Achieving the 70% workforce participation target by 2047 will require sustained efforts across multiple dimensions, such as strengthening childcare support, enhancing flexible work policies... and encouraging private sector diversity hiring through policy nudges,” the official said.

According to the official, there is a consensus at the highest level that for India to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, the rate of participation by women should be on a par with the global rate and this could come in with targeted interventions only.

The global female labour force participation rate is over 50% compared to 80% for men.

The report could propose different working arrangements for the female workforce to enable them to manage the dual responsibility. Besides, it could list out a few sectors that are more conducive for women to work such as the care economy, among others. Further, emphasis would also be laid on creating a secure public transport and stay facilities for women around the workplace, enabling a safer and conducive work environment.",Politics
https://timesascent.com/articles/india-inc-races-to-bridge-ai-skill-gap-as-demand-outpaces-supply,"India Inc is staring at a huge shortage of artificial intelligence (AI) experts with only half of the demand getting fulfilled, according to the findings of a BCG report shared with ET.

This supply demand gap will persist with an expected shortage of 53% even by 2026-end, according to Ashish Garg, MD and senior partner, BCG India.

BCG’s ‘GenAI Adoption Conundrum’ report noted companies are currently investing up to 1.5% of their revenues in workforce learning and development to stay competitive, with the majority going towards upskilling employees on new technologies including AI. “Organisations should start by picking a few key use cases and demonstrating value before asking for larger investments,” said Garg.

Noting three roadblocks to becoming AI ready, Garg noted them as lack of leadership awareness, making organisational changes around structure and culture, and being able to deliver measurable results.

“While India has the largest STEM talent pool, companies still struggle to find AI specialists,” he said.

“If we zoom out and look at the next five years, AI is going to penetrate every aspect of human work, whether personal or business-related. As a result, the required skill sets will encompass almost every traditional business function,” said Tiger Tyagarajan, senior advisor at BCG.

The most significant skill gap lies at two ends of the spectrum, according to Tyagarajan. “First is the need for deep specialists in various AI-related domains; second, we need a broader workforce that can effectively use AI. The latter is the bigger challenge,” he said. The real challenge lies in getting the “plumbing” right, said Garg. “This is integrating AI into systems and workflows, which requires deeper, more specialised skills.”

Organisations must retrain their existing workforce, said experts. “Companies with 100,000 employees worldwide can’t rely solely on hiring new talent—they must also reskill their current employees,” said Tyagarajan.

About 1–2% of the knowledge workforce needs to be deeply specialised in AI. “This group will build solutions that others can use,” he said.

BCG research suggests that employees are open to AI adoption than employers realise. “Employees here in India are more willing to adopt AI-driven roles, but this also means that talent costs will continue to rise,” said Garg.

The top five countries in the world according to BCG that are pioneering AI include the US, Singapore, Mainland China, the UK, and Canada. “India, on the other hand, is what we classify as a rising contender in AI,” said Garg.

“While India is not yet at the level of these AI pioneers, this is exactly why everyone is rushing to India (due to availability of talent pool). In the long term, they have to leverage India, as they won’t be able to build everything in-house,” said Tyagarajan.

Two metrics—reskilling investment and revenue per headcount—are becoming strong leading indicators of a company’s success, as well as broader industry and economic trends, he said.



For India’s top 500 listed companies, BCG estimates over one million hours of training are needed for mid and senior-level management to integrate AI into business strategy, digital transformation, and agile methodologies.",Technology
https://timesascent.com/articles/it-s-homecoming-for-hospitality-staff,"With new hotel signings going up in remote locations, thousands of new jobs will get created in the hospitality sector in several small towns this year.

How are chains hoping to fulfil demand? By investing CSR funds on skilling and upskilling locals, and through reverse migration, enabling existing employees to move back to their hometowns, senior executives at leading hotel chains said.

Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) had last month signed a memorandum of understanding for India's largest hospitality skilling centre in Goa in partnership with the state's skills department.

“This will significantly support the thriving tourism ecosystem in Goa, providing opportunities for hospitality training in the state and neighbouring regions,” Gaurav Pokhariyal, executive vice president for HR at IHCL, told ET. “As we continue to expand our portfolio in tier-two and -three cities such as Jamshedpur, Nagpur and Kumbalgarh, we are focusing on skilling the local workforce,” he added.

Sanjay Bose, executive VP for HR, learning and development at ITC Hotels, said the chain’s expansion “into tier-two and -three cities presents significant opportunities for reverse migration.”

ITC Hotels also reached out to over 300 institutions last year for structured internship programmes covering over 5,000 students, Bose said.

Better work-life balance and lower cost of living are prompting many professionals to relocate to tier-two, -three locations, according to Vinay Jaswal, VP, HR operations (South Asia) and HR tech and analytics (APEC), at Marriott International.

Nikhil Sharma, managing director and COO, South Asia, of Radisson Hotel Group, said 50% of the workforce at its hotel in Saputara hill station in Gujarat have earlier worked in the metros. “We anticipate creating 3,000 new jobs across India, propelled by new openings in tier-two and -three markets. This expansion is enabling reverse migration, allowing skilled professionals to build careers in their hometowns,” he said.

Sharma said the chain’s partnership with the Tourism & Hospitality Skill Council (THSC) and The Job Plus is equipping young individuals with industry-aligned training.

Zane Dmello, director, HR, India, at Hyatt India Consultancy, said up to 31% of new team members are returning to their hometowns, depending on the location and stage of hiring.

Chains have looked at investing CSR funds on skilling in a big way, said Divya Krishan, VP, The Job Plus. “Brands such as Radisson Hotel Group and Chalet Hotels have come forward to ensure there is social empowerment alongside employability linked skilling,” she added. The Job Plus was founded by industry veteran Natwar Nagar and works on mobilising unskilled, raw candidates for the sector.

Mielle Batliwala, AVP, HR, at Sarovar Hotels, said given the chain’s expansion in various destinations, many senior professionals are choosing to return to their hometowns.",Technology

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-rcna212486,"The federal judge presiding over Mahmoud Khalil’s case ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration, for now, cannot deport or detain the Columbia University activist based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The judge's preliminary injunction will not take effect until Friday, giving the government time to appeal. He stayed the preliminary injunction until 9:30 a.m. Friday.

""This is the news we’ve been waiting over three months for,"" Khalil’s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, said in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the legal teams involved in the case.

Rubio has cited an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s removal from the United States, saying he poses a national security risk. He had argued that the provision allows the secretary of state to “personally determine” whether Khalil should remain in the country.

U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil could not be removed or detained based on Rubio’s determination.

Khalil was a Columbia University student who played an active role in protests over the war in Gaza on the Manhattan campus last year.

He was arrested by federal agents in March and has been held since then as he and his lawyers have challenged efforts to deport him. The Trump administration has accused him of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Khalil has acted to “glorify and support terrorists.”

Khalil, who has not been charged with any crime, last week called the claims “grotesque and false.”

In his decision Wednesday, the judge said Khalil's ""career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled — and this adds up to irreparable harm.""

The Department of Homeland Security has also argued that it could detain Khalil because he inaccurately completed his lawful-permanent-resident application.

But that would not work as an argument to keep him detained, Farbiarz wrote.

""The evidence is that lawful permanent residents are virtually never detained pending removal” for those types of omissions, he wrote.

“And that strongly suggests that it is the Secretary of State’s determination that drives the Petitioner’s ongoing detention — not the other charge against him,” Farbiarz wrote.

The ACLU called the preliminary injunction ""a huge win.""

Khalil's lawyers called for his immediate release and said they would not stop fighting until he is home with his wife and child in the United States.

“This vindicates what Mahmoud has maintained since day one — that the government cannot detain or deport him based on Rubio’s say-so,"" said Ramzi Kassem, a co-founder for the Center for Constitutional Rights.

The Homeland Security and State departments did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment.

Khalil was one of the first campus protesters targeted by the Trump administration, which has vowed to strike back over protests over the war in Gaza, which Israel launched after Hamas attacked it on Oct. 7, 2023.

Trump has targeted Columbia and Harvard, citing a fight to combat antisemitism at universities.

The Trump administration last week claimed Columbia violated Jewish students’ rights and threatened its accreditation.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-eight-new-members-rcna212477,"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has tapped eight new members to join the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee, just two days after he fired the previous slate.

The new members include well-known vaccine skeptics and others who have been critical of Covid vaccines or pandemic interventions like lockdowns.

Kennedy, a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, said Wednesday on X that the members would convene June 25 for a scheduled meeting. He referred to them as “highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America’s most accomplished physicians.”

The list includes Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaccine activist who suggested this year, without evidence, that recent pediatric deaths from measles were due to medical error, and Vicky Pebsworth, director of research and patient safety at the National Vaccine Information Center, considered a leading source of misinformation about vaccines.

Historically, members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, have undergone an extensive vetting process before they were appointed that can take months to years. The panel typically consists of 15 or more members, meaning the meeting in two weeks would be about half the normal size. It was not clear whether Kennedy intended to appoint additional members.

Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Wednesday evening that “all newly appointed ACIP members were thoroughly vetted” but declined to offer specifics about what the vetting process entailed or how long it took. Regarding the qualifications of new members who have criticized vaccines, Nixon referred NBC News to Kennedy’s comments on X.

“Being a vaccine skeptic is not a bad thing if you follow the science,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, a group that has called Kennedy and his policies a danger to public health. “I’m concerned that the names he’s put out so far aren’t ideologically balanced. I think he got the slate he was looking for.”

Noel Brewer, an ACIP member who was fired this week, told MSNBC on Wednesday that the panel’s charter requires members to be replaced on a rolling basis.

“The new panel is missing all of the expertise that has come before them,” said Brewer, a professor in the department of health behavior at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. “They don’t know how to go about looking at the evidence, how to think about the volumes of data that will be coming their way.”

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, similarly noted that “it’ll be a big challenge for these new members because there will be a number of new issues to come up for votes.”

“Unless they have followed the ACIP deliberations personally, they won’t be as up to date on these various issues,” Schaffner said.

ACIP is normally made up of pediatricians, geriatricians and other vaccine experts. The group Kennedy selected includes a psychiatrist and neuroscientist, epidemiologist and biostatistician, and professor of operations management. One newly appointed member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor, served on ACIP from 2008 to 2012.

The psychiatrist and neuroscientist, Joseph Hibbeln, formerly worked at the National Institutes of Health. His research has focused on omega-3 fatty acids, including the neurocognitive development of children whose mothers consumed seafood during pregnancy.

The professor of operations management, Retsef Levi, who teaches at the MIT Sloan School of Management and does not have a medical degree, has called for an end to Covid vaccinations, claiming mRNA vaccines cause serious harm and death, especially among young people. In reality, the vaccines come with a very small risk of inflammation of the heart muscle, but data has overwhelmingly shown they're safe and effective.

The epidemiologist and biostatistician, Martin Kulldorff, is one of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, a pandemic strategy that decried lockdowns and advocated for letting people at minimal risk of dying get exposed to Covid. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, was another co-author.

Rounding out the list of new ACIP members are Dr. Michael Ross, whom Kennedy described Wednesday as a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, and Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician.

Kulldorff, Malone, Meissner and Pebsworth are included in the dedication of Kennedy’s 2021 book, “The Real Anthony Fauci,” about the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The acknowledgments were first noted by STAT.

ACIP is meant to analyze the latest data on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including newly approved inoculations and new data about existing vaccines. The panel offers recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year, the committee holds public meetings at which data is presented and reviewed. While the CDC is not required to follow the advice, it often does.

Advisory members are also required to disclose conflicts of interest, recusing themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist. It is not clear whether Kennedy has required those disclosures for the new members.

Kennedy said Monday in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal that ACIP “has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.” Members of the medical community have widely resisted that claim, saying there is no evidence to support it.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nba/pacers-thunder-game-3-nba-finals-result-rcna212523,"The Indiana Pacers didn't need one of their signature improbable comebacks to win Game 3 of the NBA Finals. And because of it, the Oklahoma City Thunder, once the heavy favorite to claim the league championship, will now need a rally of their own to keep their title hopes alive.

During a bravura fourth quarter Wednesday in Indianapolis, the Pacers unleashed their best defense of the series and hustle on offense to force Oklahoma City into uncharacteristic mistakes and earn a 116-107 win and a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.

NBA history suggests that the significance of this victory is hard to overstate: The team that wins Game 3 of an NBA Finals tied 1-1 goes on to win the series 80.5% of the time.

Game 4 is Friday in Indianapolis.

Oklahoma City scored only 18 points in the fourth quarter while making only six of its 17 shots, and it was outscored by 14 points in the game's decisive final 12 minutes. Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league's Most Valuable Player, was held to just 1-of-3 shooting over that span largely under the harassing defense of Pacers forward Pascal Siakam.

Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 24 points but needed 20 shots, and he committed six turnovers.

Indiana is 24-3 this season when it holds opponents to fewer than 110 points — including 14-0 at home.

""It wasn’t all bad,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""But we definitely have to play our style and impose our will for more of the 48 minutes if we want to come on the road and get a win.""

Tyrese Haliburton scored 22 points with 11 assists and nine rebounds in a performance that was drastically more aggressive than three days earlier in a series-tying loss in Oklahoma City.

Yet the Pacers' hero Wednesday was reserve Bennedict Mathurin, who failed to play even a single second during the opening quarter yet went on to score 27 points over his next 22 minutes. It was the highest-scoring performance by a reserve in the Finals since 2011, and his offensive outburst helped Indiana's reserves outscore Oklahoma City's 49-18.

At halftime, holding a 64-60 lead, Indiana looked like a different team from the one that returned from Oklahoma City with a 1-1 split.

It had scored more points in transition — one of the secrets of the team’s postseason success — in just two quarters than it had scored in either of the two previous games. Indiana finished with 17 fast-break points, nearly tying its total from the first two games of the series.

And the Pacers' reserves had scored 30 points by halftime, which was not only nearly half the team’s total but also 19 more than Oklahoma City’s own bench, the same unit that had decisively swung Game 2 in the Thunder’s favor.

Indiana point guard TJ McConnell and Mathurin were primarily responsible for that turnaround by the Pacers’ bench. Shortly after they entered, the Pacers trailed by eight points, but McConnell had soon pestered the Thunder into three steals, including two in the backcourt. After turning up the pressure with each steal, McConnell gestured to his home crowd to turn up the noise.

And after having made five shots total in the first two games of the series, Mathurin made five of his six shots in the first half alone of Game 3.

""This is the kind of team that we are,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We need everybody to be ready. It’s not always going to be exactly the same guys that are stepping up with scoring and stuff like that. But this is how we got to do it, and we got to do it as a team. And we’ve got to make it as hard as possible on them.""

Their play earned Indiana a halftime lead. Yet Indiana’s poor finish to the third quarter, scoring just five points over the final five minutes, earned it an uphill challenge, and a five-point deficit, entering the final quarter. Oklahoma City’s vulnerability — perhaps its only one — was its lack of playoff experience, and it made the series’ return to Indiana a critical opportunity for the Pacers.

Oklahoma City indeed displayed unexpected flaws. Its 19 turnovers were its most of these playoffs.

Yet despite their youth, the Thunder at times also showed steely resolve. Rather than become rattled by playing on the road, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams, in only his third season, led Oklahoma City out of tight jams with both his scoring and his passing late in the third quarter, and his layup with seven minutes to play in the fourth quarter helped erase what had been a four-point Indiana lead.

But Indiana, so good at comebacks throughout this postseason, played superbly in the final minutes in building and protecting its lead.

""I was proud of the way we bounced back from a rough ending to the third quarter,"" Carlisle said. ""That was something that could have shaken us up a lot.""

First with five minutes to play, and again just 35 seconds later, the Pacers grabbed two offensive rebounds that turned into four points when the Thunder failed to box out. Breakdowns like that helped Indiana extend its lead to eight with 3:20 to play.

“They really outplayed us in the fourth,” Daigneault said.

The Thunder have already faced a similar position in these playoffs, when they lost two of the first three games against Denver in the second round and ultimately came back to win the series.",Sports

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/obituaries/mtvs-ananda-lewis-dies-52-rcna212519,"Ananda Lewis, a former MTV VJ, has died at the age of 52.

Lakshmi Emory, whom Lewis once described as a “phenomenal sister” in a birthday message, shared news of her death in a June 11 Facebook post.

“She’s free, and in His heavenly arms,” she wrote next to a black-and-white photo of Lewis. “Lord, rest her soul.”

Emory did not share additional details, including Lewis’ cause of death.

Lewis was an MTV staple in the late ‘90s, hosting “Total Request Live” and video countdown show“Hot Zone.” She also hosted her own talk show “The Ananda Lewis Show” in 2001.

Lewis was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in 2019, but later revealed that she opted against the double mastectomy doctors recommended at the time.

In a January 2025 op-ed for Essence, Lewis shared that she tried alternative methods to monitor her breast cancer, including cuting out alcohol, sugar, monthly ultrasounds, high-dose vitamin C IVs, hyperbaric chamber sessions and qigong exercise, among others.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, she discovered that her tumor had grown and underwent genetically targeted fractionated chemotherapy, which is a treatment that destroys cancer cells without harming healthy ones, according to Cleveland Clinic.

However, a PET scan done in October 2023 confirmed that her cancer had progressed to Stage 4 cancer. This time, she shared that she underwent treatment at an integrative facility.

While Lewis had previously said she regretted refusing to undergo mammograms out of fear of radiation exposure, she urged the importance of women getting informed and learning about prevention.

In her 2025 Essence piece, she wrote, “Going into 2025, I would say to women: Do everything in your power to avoid my story becoming yours. If I had known what I know now 10 years ago, perhaps I wouldn’t have ended up here.”

The images, taken by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft and released Wednesday by the European Space Agency, offer fresh insights into the sun’s behavior, its magnetic field and how it produces space weather.

“The sun is our nearest star, giver of life and potential disruptor of modern space and ground power systems, so it is imperative that we understand how it works and learn to predict its behaviour,” Carole Mundell, director of science at the European Space Agency (ESA), said in a statement. “These new unique views from our Solar Orbiter mission are the beginning of a new era of solar science.”

The images have already been a boon for heliophysicists, showing turbulent magnetic activity at the south pole as the sun ramps up to the most active phase of its natural cycle.

The solar cycle typically spans about 11 years, with the sun going from a quiet period of low magnetic activity to a highly active phase characterized by intense solar flares and solar storms. As the sun reaches peak activity — a phase known as the solar maximum — its magnetic poles flip, meaning the sun’s south pole becomes magnetic north.

Why exactly that happens is unclear, as are precise forecasts for when it will occur. Solar Orbiter may be able to tease out some of these answers.",Science

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/los-angeles-officials-fear-marines-rules-force-rcna212143,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s deployment of thousands of troops including 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests is fueling concern that the Marines have not been properly trained for interacting with civilians, including children, during potentially tense law enforcement operations.

One of the duties of the Marines and National Guard troops will be to provide security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel as they conduct immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, according to officials with knowledge of the operation and court filings. National Guard troops and Marines will transport ICE agents to and from raids and secure neighborhood perimeters while ICE agents conduct operations.

California Democrats argue that this violates the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that bars federal troops from participating in civilian law enforcement efforts. California Attorney General Rob Bonta argued in a court motion on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s deployment violates that law.

“The federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines deployed in Los Angeles will engage in quintessential law enforcement activity in violation of the PCA,” the motion said, referring to the Posse Comitatus Act. “Defendants will create a substantial likelihood that the military will physically confront, detain, or search civilians whom they perceive are posing a security threat, thereby actively executing civil laws.”

A military official with knowledge of the operation told NBC News that the Marines would not conduct arrests and would only transport and guard ICE agents. They said that these activities would not violate the Posse Comitatus Act.

As with many other political battles since Trump took office, the issue will be decided in court. On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer will hold a hearing in San Francisco to hear arguments from both sides regarding Trump’s use of the National Guard and Marines in L.A.

Breyer could accept or reject Bonta’s request that he issue a court order blocking the Trump administration from using National Guard troops and Marines during ICE operations.

Some local law enforcement officials and state Democrats say that Trump is stoking tensions rather than calming them. The National Guard is often used to respond to riots or violence on American streets. And active-duty Marines are not typically trained for domestic law enforcement and lack the tools or the training to respond to civil disturbances.

Mike Hillman, a law enforcement consultant, military veteran and former Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief who served more than 40 years in the department, said there is a big difference between what law enforcement does and what Marines do.

“The Marines are warfighters and they come with rules of engagement and tools and equipment that they would normally use under those circumstances,” Hillman told NBC News. “This situation has serious consequences. It puts the United States Marine Corps and the warfighters in the position where they are having to deal with domestic incidents on domestic soil.”

Concerns about Marine 'rules of force'

Some of the Marines deployed to Los Angeles will provide security and transportation for ICE personnel as they conduct operations. This includes driving ICE agents in military vehicles to arrest locations, according to two sources familiar with the plans.

The Marines have been issued small cards that list “rules of force” — terminology used for domestic military operations, the two sources said. The cards describe what Marines are allowed to do during a deployment.

Two sources familiar with the planning say that ICE agents, as well as local officials in Los Angeles, have expressed concern about those rules of engagement. The sources said ICE agents worry that the Marines have not been properly trained and could be pulled into law enforcement operations for which local police or the National Guard is better suited.

Jim McDonnell, the Los Angeles police chief, said in a statement Monday that he was not notified of the Marine deployment and urged federal officials to maintain continuous communications with local law enforcement officials.

“The arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles — absent clear coordination — presents a significant logistical and operational challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city,” he said. “We are urging open and continuous lines of communication between all agencies to prevent confusion, avoid escalation, and ensure a coordinated, lawful, and orderly response during this critical time.”

Warning from Rodney King riots

An incident in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots following the police beating of Rodney King serves as a cautionary tale. According to the book “Fires and Furies” by Maj. Gen. James Delk, who oversaw National Guard operations in California at the time, Marines caused an incident when they accompanied police officers to a domestic disturbance in the wake of the riots.

A police officer asked the Marines to “cover me” as he tried to enter the residence, according to the book. Instead of simply pointing their weapons at it to deter the people inside, the Marines opened fire on the house.

“The officer had not meant shoot when he yelled ‘cover me’ to the Marines,” Delk wrote. The officer meant, “point your weapon and be prepared to respond if necessary. However, the Marines responded instantly in the way they had been trained, where ‘cover me’ means ‘provide me with cover using firepower.’”

California legal battle

Bonta’s motion asked Breyer, the federal judge in San Francisco, to issue a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from using National Guard troops or Marines during ICE operations.

“Defendants, including President Trump and Secretary of Defense Hegseth have sought to bring military personnel and a ‘warrior culture’ to the streets of cities and towns where Americans work, go to school and raise their families,” Bonta wrote.

On Tuesday, Department of Justice lawyers rebuffed Bonta’s motion. “Plaintiffs’ motion is legally meritless,” they wrote in a filing. “It seeks an extraordinary, unprecedented and dangerous court order.”

Bonta’s motion argued that the administration’s actions, in fact, were dangerous. “There is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles,” it said, “only the kind of civil unrest that occurs from time to time that is typically the purview of local law enforcement.”",World

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-violence-police-jan-6-los-angeles-rcna211912,"President Donald Trump has promised swift retribution for any violence against law enforcement by protesters in Los Angeles.

“IF THEY SPIT, WE WILL HIT, and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before,” he wrote on his social media platform after making a similar statement a day earlier to reporters. “Such disrespect will not be tolerated!”

It is an about-face for the president.

On Jan. 6, 2021, Peter Stager assaulted an officer with a flagpole during the riot on the U.S. Capitol. Another, Daniel “D.J.” Rodriguez, drove a stun gun into the neck of a Capitol Police officer and pleaded guilty to the crime. And a third, Julian Khater, pepper-sprayed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick in the face. Sicknick later died.

Trump pardoned them all.

Trump’s tolerance for violence against law enforcement during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is facing renewed scrutiny in the wake of his remarks and actions in Los Angeles, where his administration is taking a hard line against protesters. He federalized thousands of National Guard members and sent 700 U.S. Marines to the country’s second-largest city — against the wishes of state and local officials — after protesters blocked immigration enforcement actions.

It’s a sea change from how Trump treated the Jan. 6 riot, when his supporters attacked the Capitol in an attempt to block Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.

In an address Tuesday evening about events in his state, California Gov. Gavin Newsom addressed the disparity.

“By the way, Trump, he’s not opposed to lawlessness and violence, as long as it serves him. What more evidence do we need than Jan. 6?” Newsom said.

Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who was serving in the Capitol during the attack, told NBC News that he sees Trump’s actions then and now as hypocritical.

“Donald Trump is OK with violence, as long as it’s done in his name. That’s the message that he’s sending right now,” Dunn said. “That’s why he pardoned the people on Jan. 6: They did it in his name … what about the officers on Jan. 6? Just put an asterisk by those officers and say, ‘Not them. They stopped Donald Trump from succeeding.’”

The White House says Trump is fulfilling his mandate. “President Trump was elected to secure the border, equip federal officials with the tools to execute this plan, and restore law and order. This also underscores the need to pass the OBBB, which would provide record funding and resources to those on the front lines in Los Angeles,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement, referring to Trump’s push for his “one big, beautiful bill,” the legislative vehicle for his agenda currently before Congress.

On Wednesday, NBC News also asked Attorney General Pam Bondi about how the Trump administration is handling California versus Jan. 6, 2021.

“Well, this is very different,” she said. “These are people out there hurting people in California right now. This is ongoing. No longer. We’re going to protect them. We’re going to do everything we can to prosecute violent criminals in California. California is burning. These people are waving Mexican flags, yet they don’t want anyone to go back to Mexico. They’re burning American flags. This is the United States of America, and we’re going to protect Americans. We’re going to protect all citizens out there.”

During the riot at the Capitol, no National Guard help arrived for hours, despite pleas from those inside the building. Then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller testified before a House panel that Trump never gave a formal deployment order, and other testimony described then-Vice President Mike Pence taking the lead in attempting to get the National Guard out to help control the mob.

Meanwhile, rioters violently broke through barriers, smashed windows, brutalized officers and chanted threats to Pence. In all, at least 140 police officers were injured.

Trump later called it “a day of love” and has referred to the rioters as “hostages,” “warriors” and “victims.”

“What they’ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,” Trump told President Joe Biden at last year’s first presidential debate, referring to the rioters. “What you have done, how you’ve destroyed the lives of so many people.

Michael Fanone, a former D.C. police officer who was attacked by Rodriguez on Jan. 6, took issue with Trump’s posture in California. Fanone called the president “a hypocrite,” and “a liar.”

“Had those people storming the Capitol been illegal f--- immigrants or Black people or any other group that … his base found to be displeasing, then they would have said ‘open fire,’” Fanone said in an interview.

The Los Angeles clashes began Friday as federal immigration agents attempted to carry out arrests in the city. Some protesters tried to stop vehicles carrying detained immigrants and the confrontations soon turned violent, with officers using pepper spray and batons.

By Sunday, National Guard troops, outfitted with heavy military equipment, moved into downtown Los Angeles. Some demonstrators pelted law enforcement vehicles with rocks and debris and set numerous vehicles on fire. Dozens of people were arrested over the weekend, and the L.A. Police Department reported five officers suffering minor injuries and two others treated and released from the hospital in recent days.

By Monday, Trump had deployed the Marines into the state.

At a news conference on Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., both brought up comparisons to Jan. 6.

“We begged the President of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it,” Pelosi said. “That day he didn’t do it. He forgave those people.”

Gomez spoke of the furor with which the events unfolded that day.

“There was 50,000 people outside,” Gomez said. “They were scaling the walls, scaling the walls. They were bashing in, breaking in, with members of Congress, members of Congress, trapped in the gallery, including myself, including a lot of the people here.”

Earlier this year, Trump issued more than 1,500 pardons or commutations for the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day in office.

Among the crimes Trump dissolved was that of Stager, a 44-year-old truck driver from Arkansas who was sentenced to four years in prison for the flagpole assault. According to prosecutors, Stager was caught on a Jan. 6 video saying, “Every single one of those Capitol law enforcement officers, death is the remedy, that is the only remedy they get.”

Dunn, the former U.S. Capitol police officer, noted that the same Republicans who are in lockstep with Trump at this moment in California are the same ones who have refused to display a plaque commemorating those who died and were injured on Jan. 6.

“What about the blue from Jan. 6th? They don’t even want to put the plaque up! Back the blue that way then,” Dunn added. “It’s hypocritical and they’re aware that it’s all about appeasing their base and appeasing the leader of their party, which is Donald Trump.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-attend-les-miserables-premiere-protests-continue-country-rcna212323,"President Donald Trump attended the opening night of “Les Misérables,” a musical set against a background of revolution and protest, at Washington’s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday.

""We’ve seen it a number of times. It’s fantastic,"" Trump, who was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, told reporters at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday night.

The monthlong run of the Tony Award-winning show is opening amid widespread protests against Trump’s immigration policies and his decision to deploy members of the military in response.

Trump defended the decision in response to a reporter's question about the move Wednesday night.

""If we weren't there, if we didn't bring in the National Guard and the Marines, you would probably have a city that was burning to the ground,"" he said.

""You saw what they did, the damage. So if you don't do something about that, there's something very wrong. We are going to have law and order in our country,"" he added.

As he took his seat in the theater’s presidential box, according to Reuters, Trump received a smattering of boos and cheers. The audience included ""several drag queens in full regalia, likely in response to Trump’s criticism of the venue for hosting drag shows,"" the news organization reported.

During the intermission, Reuters said, one audience member shouted ""Viva Los Angeles"" as Trump moved from his seat.

Protesting against power is a major theme in the show, which is centered on student-led demonstrations against the French monarchy.

Trump was asked which of the story’s two main characters he most relates to: Jean Valjean, an empathetic protagonist once jailed for stealing bread to feed his family before committing to a life of service, or Javert, an authoritative police inspector eager to persecute Valjean and jail him once again.

Trump called the question “tough” and left it unanswered before he pivoted to another topic.

The official summary on the Kennedy Center’s website reads, “Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, the musical tells an enthralling story of broken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice, and redemption — a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit.”

Songs from the musical have been used in protests against governments around the world since the show debuted in 1980, including by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong in 2019.

Protesters sang one of the show’s most popular and recognizable hits, “Do You Hear the People Sing?” which includes the lyrics “Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men?”

The show is the first production Trump has attended as head of the Kennedy Center. He did not attend any performances during his first term in office, and in February he replaced the entire board of trustees and had himself named chairman of the board.

Trump told reporters Wednesday that ""Les Misérables"" was ""just about our first choice,"" even after some concerts were canceled and other productions withdrew after he installed himself as chairman.

""Other great ones are coming,” he added.

A performance by the Gay Men’s Chorus in honor of Pride Month was canceled — and other artists and productions pulled out of planned shows to protest the changes, including actor Issa Rae and a production of “Hamilton.”

“Our show simply cannot, in good conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center,” “Hamilton” producer Jeffrey Seller said in a statement in March.

A spokesperson for ""Les Miz"" said Wednesday, “We are looking forward to performing for D.C. audiences beginning tonight and throughout the engagement at the Kennedy Center, where the U.S. first saw the original production in 1986.”

The performance Wednesday is a fundraiser for the Kennedy Center. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, were also in attendance.

Security around the venue was tightened for the performance, the Kennedy Center said.

“Please be advised the Kennedy Center will be closed to non-ticket holders on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, due to enhanced security protocols,” its website said.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-speech-prompts-concerns-politicization-military-rcna212437,"WASHINGTON — Defense Department officials say troops who cheered and jeered Tuesday at President Donald Trump’s political statements at a rally at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, did not violate military regulations, but a former military legal officer said they did just that.

During the speech, uniformed soldiers yelled in support of Trump’s political statements and booed former President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“Do you think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I don’t think so,” Trump said to boos about Biden.

Trump made other comments about Newsom and about Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, where protests against the administration’s crackdown on immigrants have been taking place and where Trump has ordered thousands of National Guard members and active-duty Marines deployed in response. Other Trump comments about the “fake news media,” transgender people, protesters in California and flag-burning also drew boos from the uniformed military members in attendance.

Trump is known for his rallies at which he goes after and pokes fun at political enemies and other issues, but typically he makes those remarks at political events, not on U.S. military bases.

Such overt political activity on a base is the prerogative of the commander in chief. But military leaders would typically frown upon troops’ reacting the way they did as inconsistent with military good order and discipline, and, according to one expert, it is a violation of military regulations found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.

Presidents of both parties often use troops as political props and put them and their commanders in difficult positions by doing so, but Trump’s speech took that to a new level, said Geoffrey DeWeese, a retired judge advocate general who is now an attorney with Mark S. Zaid PC. (Zaid has represented whistleblowers on both sides of the aisle, including one who filed a complaint about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 that led to Trump’s impeachment, and he was one of the people whose security clearances Trump revoked this year.)

“It’s a sad tradition to use the military as a backdrop for political purposes,” DeWeese said. “To actively attack another president or a sitting governor and incite the crowd to boo, that’s a step in a dangerous direction, that really says we want to politicize the military, that sends a bad message.”

DeWeese said there were likely to have been violations of the UCMJ.

“I would be cringing if I was a senior officer and it happened under my watch,” he said.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly that he wants to take politics out of the military by removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning service by transgender service members.

Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who worked at the State Department and the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and at the Pentagon under former President George H.W. Bush, said in an email that commanders at Fort Bragg should have done a better job preparing troops there.

“It’s terrible,” she wrote. “It’s predictably bad behavior by the President to try and score political points in a military setting, and it’s a command failure by leaders at Ft Bragg not to prepare soldiers for that bad behavior and counsel them not to participate.”

The Pentagon said in a statement that there had been no violation of the UCMJ and suggested the media was against policies that Trump has championed.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell also alleged in a statement that the media “cheered on the Biden administration” and its policies regarding the Defense Department “when they forced drag queen performances on military bases, promoted service members on the basis of race and sex in violation of federal law, and fired troops who refused an experimental vaccine.”

“Believe me, no one needs to be encouraged to boo the media,” Parnell said. “Look no further than this query, which is nothing more than a disgraceful attempt to ruin the lives of young soldiers.”

On Wednesday, Army officials at Fort Bragg addressed the sale of some MAGA merchandise at the event, which was planned in cooperation with a nonpartisan organization, American 250.

“The Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,” Col. Mary Ricks, a spokeswoman for the Army’s 18th Airborne Corps at Bragg, said in a statement. “The Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents. The vendor’s presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar circumstances in the future.”

The Army’s own new field manual, published recently, says the apolitical nature of being a U.S. soldier is what contributes to the public trust.

The Army “as an institution must be nonpartisan and appear so, too,” says the new field manual, “The Army: A Primer to Our Profession of Arms.”

“Being nonpartisan means not favoring any specific political party or group. Nonpartisanship assures the public that our Army will always serve the Constitution and our people loyally and responsively.”

U.S. troops can participate in political functions, just not while on duty or in uniform, the book says.

“As a private citizen you are encouraged to participate in our democratic process, but as a soldier you must be mindful of how your actions may affect the reputation and perceived trustworthiness of our Army as an institution,” it says.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-considering-military-strike-iran-sources-say-rcna212528,"Israel is considering taking military action against Iran — most likely without U.S. support — in the coming days, even as President Donald Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran about a diplomatic deal to curtail its nuclear program, according to five people with knowledge of the situation.

Israel has become more serious about a unilateral strike on Iran as the negotiations between the United States and Iran appear closer to a preliminary or framework agreement that includes provisions about uranium enrichment that Israel views as unacceptable.

A unilateral strike or action by Israel against Iran would be a dramatic break with the Trump administration, which has argued against such a step.

The Trump administration is awaiting a response from Iran about a proposed framework of a nuclear deal, and Trump has publicly said Tehran has become more hard-line in its negotiations.

The notion of a new front in a simmering conflict has prompted the Trump administration to order all embassies within striking distance of Iranian missiles, aircraft and other assets (including missions in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Eastern Europe) to send cables with assessments about danger and about measures to mitigate risks to Americans and U.S. infrastructure, according to two sources familiar.

U.S. and other officials are on alert awaiting the possibility of Israel’s striking Iran, the officials said.

The White House has not briefed senior lawmakers on the issue, according to that aide and a U.S. official.

One major concern is Iran’s retaliating against U.S. personnel or assets in the region for any action.

Israel, which relies on intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance from the United States, may be in a position to take unilateral action against Tehran, the source familiar said. The sources familiar and officials were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action. The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.

U.S. officials have announced that the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. And the Defense Department announced the voluntary departure of military families from locations all across the U.S. Central Command area of operations.

The CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, was due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed late Wednesday without explanation. A source familiar said Kurilla had to focus on this unfolding situation.

Another possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran’s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It’s possible Israel’s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran’s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.

While Israel would most likely prefer U.S. military and intelligence support for strikes — especially against Iranian nuclear facilities — it showed in October that it can do a lot alone.

Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the evacuation of nonessential staff members at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq will send a message to Tehran that Trump will not necessarily hold Israel back from launching a threatened attack on Iran.

“It’s about trying to get Iran to respect the president’s wishes,” Knights said.

Iran has failed to meet a two-month deadline Trump set to reach an agreement on the country’s nuclear activities, and he is frustrated, he said.

Both Knights and a source with knowledge of the matter said it was unclear whether Israel would undertake a limited military strike now or wait until nuclear negotiations played out further.

Trump has expressed growing frustration over Iran’s stance at recent indirect talks, portraying Tehran as inflexible and slow-moving.

“They’re just asking for things that you can’t do. They don’t want to give up what they have to give up,” Trump told reporters Monday. “They seek enrichment. We can’t have enrichment.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-starvation-aid-funding-hunger-rcna212295,"TEL AVIV — The new executive chairman for the controversial American-backed humanitarian organization distributing aid in the Gaza Strip refused to reveal the donors who are financing the agency, though he did tell NBC News that to his knowledge the group is not funded by the Israeli government.

Johnnie Moore, an evangelical Christian and former PR consultant who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, was appointed executive chairman of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) last week as the organization reeled from the resignation of his predecessor. It has also faced criticism from the United Nations and aid groups for a lack of independence from Israel, which backs the organization along with the U.S.

Since it started operating late last month, the group has set up aid distribution sites in Gaza in response to international pressure over serious malnutrition in Gaza, where Israel recently lifted an 11-week complete blockade on food, aid and medical supplies entering the enclave.

But regular bouts of deadly violence in and around those sites has also brought increasing scrutiny on the GHF’s source of funding and the degree of autonomy it has from Israel.

In an exclusive interview last week, Moore said it was “a private foundation.”

“Like lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn’t disclose its donors,” he said. “Anything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans.”

Pressed on accusations that Israel was financing and controlling the organization, Moore said that “based upon what I know, this is an independent initiative that is not funded by the Israeli government.”

Other questions have also swirled around the GHF, even before it launched four aid distribution points in southern and central Gaza.

A day before it began operations in the strip, Moore’s predecessor Jake Wood resigned, saying in a letter published by Reuters that continuing to work with the group would compromise his “neutrality, impartiality and independence.”

United Nations agencies and major aid groups that previously ran hundreds of community kitchens and bakeries in the enclave have also refused to cooperate with it, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid, forces widespread displacement in Gaza, and concentrates distribution in areas that may not be accessible to everyone.

Setting up so few sites for food distribution meant crowd control problems were inevitable, according to Ciaran Donnelly, the senior vice president for international programs at the International Rescue Committee, which ran major relief operations in Gaza. “No aid organization would recommend doing it that way,” he said.

Inside Israel, as well, critics have questioned its independence. Last month in front of Israel’s legislature, opposition leader Yair Lapid, without providing evidence, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of funding the GHF through foreign shell companies. And last week, citing unnamed public officials, Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Israeli government had sent hundreds of millions of shekels to the group.

Israel’s government has repeatedly denied it funds the GHF.

Any organization “being used by occupying powers” would not be able to carry out its task according to the humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence, said Philip Grant, the executive director of TRIAL International, a Geneva-based nongovernmental organization that advocates for victims of war crimes.

TRIAL International has called on the Swiss government to investigate GHF, whose only registered presence outside the U.S. is in Geneva.

While the GHF has said it is working to open new sites, including in northern Gaza, no such distribution points have opened yet, forcing some Palestinians with advanced injuries and disabilities to walk long distances for aid — often through dangerous areas and extreme heat.

Such onerous requirements for something as basic as food could amount to war crimes, Grant said, and could even lead to accusations that organizations like GHF are complicit.

“This operation comes with a huge risk in terms of violations of the Geneva Conventions,” Grant said. “Especially the forced displacement of populations, which, if carried out, would be a participation in the war crime of enforced displacement of civilian population.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/36-palestinians-killed-trying-obtain-desperately-needed-aid-gaza-rcna212256,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinians desperately trying to access aid in Gaza came under fire again Tuesday, killing 36 people and wounding 207, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

Experts and humanitarian aid workers say Israel’s blockade and 20-month military campaign have pushed Gaza to the brink of famine.

At least 163 people have been killed and 1,495 wounded in a number of shootings near aid sites run by the Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are in military zones that are off-limits to independent media. The Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions at people who it says approached its forces in a suspicious manner.

The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves. But it has warned people to stay on designated access routes and it paused delivery last week while it held talks with the military on improving safety.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that there is “meaningful progress” on a possible ceasefire deal that would also return some of the 55 hostages still being held in Gaza, but said it was “too early to hope.” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also mentioned Tuesday that there was progress in ceasefire negotiations.

Netanyahu was meeting with the Israeli negotiating team and the defense minister Tuesday evening to discuss next steps.

In southern Gaza, at least eight people were killed while trying to obtain aid around Rafah, according to Nasser Hospital.

In northern Gaza, two men and a child were killed and at least 130 were wounded on Tuesday, according to Nader Garghoun, a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. He said most were being treated for gunshot wounds.

Witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire around 2 a.m. (7 p.m. Monday ET), several hundred yards from the aid site in central Gaza. Crowds of Palestinians seeking desperately needed food often head to the sites hours before dawn, hoping to beat the crowds.

The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people it referred to as suspects. It said they had advanced toward its troops hundreds of yards from the aid site prior to its opening hours.

Mohammed Abu Hussein, a resident of the nearby built-up Bureij refugee camp, said Israeli drones and tanks opened fire, and that he saw five people wounded by gunshots.

Abed Haniyah, another witness, said Israeli forces opened fire “indiscriminately” as thousands of people were attempting to reach the food site.

“What happens every day is humiliation,” he said. “Every day, people are killed just trying to get food for their children.”

Additionally, three Palestinian medics were killed in an Israeli strike Tuesday in Gaza City, according to the health ministry.

The medics from the health ministry’s emergency service were responding to an Israeli attack on a house in Jaffa street in Gaza City when a second strike hit the building, the ministry said. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas’ military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.

Israel and the United States say they set up the new food distribution system to prevent Hamas from stealing humanitarian aid and using it to finance militant activities.

The United Nations, which runs a long-standing system capable of delivering aid to all parts of Gaza, says there is no evidence of any systematic diversion.

U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid and by forcing Palestinians to relocate to just three currently operational sites.

The other two distribution sites are in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, which Israel has transformed into a military zone. Israeli forces maintain an outer perimeter around all three hubs, and Palestinians must pass close to them to reach the distribution points.

Hamas started the war with its terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage. They still hold 55 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

ICE denied it last week, according to emails reviewed Wednesday by NBC News.

Khalil’s legal team asked in late May that he be transferred to a detention center in New Jersey to be closer to his wife and newborn son. He has been held in a Louisiana ICE facility since March.

ICE’s policy requires detaining noncitizen parents or legal guardians, who are primary caretakers or have custody of minor children, in facilities close to their children

The New Orleans ICE Field Office wrote that Khalil did not fall under the agency policy’s criteria and denied the request without explanation, according to the emails.

“I am declining your request that Mr. Khalil be transferred from the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana to a detention center in New Jersey,” an official wrote.

Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which is part of Khalil’s legal team, called the decision “cruel.”

“ICE’s directive recognizes that the government should have no role in destroying the family unit, and yet that is exactly what is happening here,” Ahmed said.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to requests for comment on the emails.

Khalil’s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, gave birth to the couple’s son in April. Citing the ICE policy, his legal team reached out to the New Orleans office in hope of getting him moved. The directive, issued in 2022, considers detained parents who have custody of their children as “covered individuals” under the policy. It stipulates that covered individuals must be placed “as close as practicable” to their minor children. It also requires ICE personnel to accommodate regular visitation between covered individuals and their minor children.

“There is no possible justification to detain Mr. Khalil at such a great distance from his minor child, in violation of ICE’s own policy, when ICE maintains numerous detention facilities within driving distance of where Mr. Khalil’s wife and infant son reside in New York City,” Khalil’s counsel wrote in an email to the New Orleans ICE office.

In an email to Khalil’s legal counsel, an official at the New Orleans ICE office said he did not qualify as a covered individual.

Khalil, who grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and was granted permanent U.S. resident status last year, became a widely recognized activist amid the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year. In March, he was abruptly arrested outside his student housing on campus and detained before being the Trump administration accused him of leading “activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.” He has not been charged with any crime.

ICE previously rejected Khalil’s request to attend his son’s birth, court documents show.

“The most immediate and visceral harms I have experienced directly relate to the birth of my son, Deen. Instead of holding my wife’s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone,” Khalil said in a legal filing last week.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kaja-sokola-former-model-poland-applauds-weinstein-conviction-rcna210764,"It wasn’t exactly the verdict that Harvey Weinstein accuser Kaja Sokola had hoped for, but it was the verdict she said women determined to fight against sexual predators needed.

Sokola, a former runway model from Poland, was one of three women who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them more than a decade ago.

On Wednesday, a Manhattan jury found Weinstein guilty of assaulting former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley but not her. And it deadlocked on a third-degree rape charge against Weinstein in the alleged sexual assault of former actor Jessica Mann.

“It’s not ideal for me,” Sokola told NBC News shortly after the verdict was announced. “But it doesn’t change that much the most important thing, that he’s convicted.”

What does it mean for the #MeToo movement, which was galvanized in 2020 by Weinstein’s landmark conviction for sexually abusing young women?

“I think it sends the message that we still have some work to do,” said Sokola, 39.

Sokola also said she doesn’t want what happened to her in court to deter other sex assault victims from coming forward.

“There’s no win or lose for me. I was not the one who was on the trial,” she said. “So I would not want these kind of decisions to discourage others from speaking their truth or from participating in proceedings like this, because we have one life to live, and if we won’t fight for our own justice, then who will?”

Sokola’s attorney, Lindsay Goldbrum, a partner at Goddard Law PLLC, said she and her client were prepared for the outcome.

“We are in a different culture than we were five years ago when this trial first happened,” she said. “But as a former prosecutor, I knew from the beginning that it was going to be an uphill battle for the prosecutors to be able to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt about a crime that occurred almost 20 years ago.”

Sokola wasn’t among the women who testified against Weinstein at his first trial, in which he was convicted of third-degree rape of Mann in 2013. He was also convicted of first-degree criminal sexual act for forcibly performing oral sex on Haley in 2006.

The convictions were overturned after an appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren’t part of the case.

Sokola was added to the case after she filed her own lawsuit against Weinstein in December 2019 under New York’s Child Victims Act.

On the stand, Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel in 2006, when she was 19 years old. The alleged abuse first began in 2002, when she was 16, and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.

“I know what he did to me when I was 16, when I was 19, and nothing will change that,” Sokola told NBC News.

Sokola’s testimony may have been undermined by her estranged older sister, Ewa Sokola, who had been subpoenaed as a prosecution witness. She testified that Sokola seemed “extremely tense” after a 2006 post-lunch meeting with Weinstein but didn’t say she had been assaulted.

“She was proud of knowing him,” Ewa Sokola testified.

Asked about that testimony, Sokola said, “I don’t have nothing to be ashamed of.”

“I think she does, or she should have,” she said of her sister.

Sokola said she has never spoken with Haley and has talked to Mann just once, about two years ago.

Initially, Sokola was part of a group of women who filed a class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and his companies, alleging he had sexually abused them. At first, she hid her identity behind a pseudonym.

Unhappy with a proposed deal under which almost all the civil cases against Weinstein would be settled for $47 million and he would not have to admit to wrongdoing, Sokola unmasked herself in December 2019 when she filed her lawsuit.

In the suit, Sokola said she was 16 in 2002 when she had just moved from Warsaw to New York City and was first introduced to Weinstein. She said that when he learned she wanted to become an actor, he told her he could help her career.

Three days later, the complaint said, Weinstein picked Sokola up for what was supposed to be a business lunch and instead took her his Manhattan apartment and demanded sex.

When a weeping Sokola tried to resist, Weinstein told her he had “made” the careers of the actors Penelope Cruz and Gwyneth Paltrow and warned the teenager that she “would never work as an actress unless she acquiesced to his demands,” according to the complaint.

Sokola said at Weinstein’s retrial that he demanded that she masturbate him while he touched her.

Sokola, 39, became one of three women who accused Weinstein of sex assault at his retrial after she told prosecutors he had also forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.

That allegation of assault mirrored the testimony of Haley, who accused Weinstein of doing the same to her in 2006 when she was looking for work in entertainment production.

Weinstein, who was hit with an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act, denied assaulting Sokola. He also denied assaulting Mann and Haley.

Weinstein spokesman Juda Engelmayer said that “we consider this a little bit of a victory” because Weinstein was acquitted on the Sokola charge.

“He’s feeling, you know, not good about being convicted for Miriam but relieved that he wasn’t convicted on Kaja and hopeful on the Jessica part,” Engelmayer said of Weinstein at a news conference.

Sokola is getting back to the dreams she says Weinstein stole from her after the alleged assaults, with the launch of her own production company, Falcon 88.

“Healing means doing what I love and being able to be a helpful member of society, being a producer that listens to others, respects others, treats people with dignity that they deserve,” she said. “It’s named after my dad. He was 88 years old when he died.”

Her first project is executive producing a film, “The Eden Express,” starring Jonah Hauer-King and David Duchovny.

Sokola is also a single mom with a young son. And when she was asked how she hopes her son will react when he finds out she testified against Weinstein, she smiled.

“I hope he will think that his mom is a badass and that his mom stands for the truth and is not afraid to speak her truth,” she said.",Entertainment
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jury-harvey-weinstein-sex-assault-retrial-reached-partial-verdict-rcna210599,"Jurors weighing the fate of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Wednesday that they had unanimously found him guilty of sexually assaulting one woman and not guilty of assaulting another more than a decade ago.

But the jurors at Weinstein's retrial told state Judge Curtis Farber in New York that they were unable to reach a verdict on allegations that he assaulted a third woman, and Farber sent them home for the day and asked them to resume deliberating on Thursday.

Weinstein, 73, had denied all the charges, and his lawyers insisted the sexual encounters with his three accusers were “transactional” and “consensual.”

But the jury came to a different conclusion after five days of deliberations, during which the foreman told the judge several times that jurors were having a hard time reaching a verdict and that several members had been clashing.

Before the partial verdict was announced, the foreman told the court he’d been threatened by another member of the panel who told him, “You know me; you going to see me outside.”

“I feel afraid inside there,” the juror told Farber, according to a transcript of the conversation supplied by the state courts. “I can’t be inside there.”

Weinstein defense attorney Arthur Aidala immediately objected.

“You have a grown man who has now said that people have told him in the jury room they’ll meet him outside,” Aidala said. “He said it twice.”

Farber dismissed that as “schoolyard nonsense.”

“He is a big guy,” the judge said. “He’s not particularly scared. He’s basically saying, ‘I am not changing my mind.’ He is not being intimidated to change his mind. He is standing his ground, which could be in your favor, of the prosecution’s favor.”

Weinstein then asked to address the judge and made a last-minute plea, saying, ""This is not right for me, the person who is on trial here.""

""Lawyers can fight all they want,"" Weinstein said, seated in his wheelchair. ""This is my life on the line. It’s not fair. It’s that simple. It’s just not fair.""

Farber agreed that it ""was not a typical deliberation"" but said that ""it does happen"" and that the result of the deliberations in the third case could wind up being in Weinstein's favor.

""It could be in my favor, but it’s not fair,"" Weinstein replied. ""That’s the problem with this. ... This is over. ""

Minutes later, the jurors returned to the courtroom and rendered a partial verdict.

Weinstein put his hands to his head after he was found guilty of criminal sexual act for the 2006 attack on former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley.

But he was found not guilty of a second charge of criminal sexual act stemming from allegations brought by former Polish runway model Kaja Sokola, who told the court he assaulted her, too, in 2006.

The jury deadlocked on a third-degree rape charge that accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting former actor Jessica Mann.

Haley’s lawyer Gloria Allred said outside the Manhattan courthouse after the partial verdict that the #MeToo movement is not dead.

“The real hero of this case is Mimi Haley, because he was convicted not once, but twice, based on her testimony,” Allred said.

Haley said that the verdict left her feeling hopeful and that she hopes others will continue to speak out against their abusers.

“To those predators who still believe they can exploit abuse and walk away unscathed: Your time is running out. The world is changing, and you will not outrun the consequences of your actions forever,” Haley said.

Sokola said she was happy with the verdict, even though the jury did not convict Weinstein of assaulting her.

“It’s a big win for everyone,” she said. “For myself, it’s closing of a chapter that caused me a lot of pain throughout my life.”

Mann said in a statement, ""I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone.""

“I didn’t speak up to ruin his life,"" Mann said of Weinstein. ""He did that. I spoke because mine matters.”

Haley and Mann testified at Weinstein’s first trial in 2020. Sokola's charge was new to the retrial.

Weinstein spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said ""we consider this a little bit of a victory"" because the producer wasn't convicted for assaulting Sokola.

""He’s feeling, you know, not good about being convicted for Miriam, but relieved that he wasn’t convicted on Kaja and hopeful on the Jessica part,"" Engelmayer said of Weinstein during a press conference.

Weinstein found himself on trial again after the state Court of Appeals last year overturned his landmark 2020 conviction for sexually abusing young women, a trial that defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn Weinstein, the Oscar-winning former chief of Miramax, into a pariah. The appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against him based on allegations that were not part of the case.

“If this person wasn’t Harvey Weinstein, would we even be here?” Aidala, his attorney, asked during his closing argument, in which he accused the women of being grifters.

Prosecutors, however, said Weinstein preyed on young women trying to make it in Hollywood, sometimes repeatedly, and threatened to wreck their careers if they talked.

“He never had any interest in their careers,” Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the jury. “He had an interest in their bodies. And he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they had wanted him to or not.""

Just as in 2020, Weinstein did not testify at his retrial. But he said in an interview with a reporter for WNYW-TV of New York after the jury began deliberations that he acted ""immorally"" and regretted having hurt his wife and family but that he never did anything ""illegal.""

""I put so many friends through this and hurt people ... that were close to me, by the way, by actions that were stupid,"" he said. ""But never illegal, never criminal, never anything.""

Much of the evidence that resulted in Weinstein’s being convicted five years ago of the third-degree rape of one woman and a first-degree criminal sex act against another woman was reintroduced at his retrial.

Just as before, Weinstein pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape based on complaints by Haley and Mann. But this time, he also pleaded not guilty to an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act in the alleged sexual assault of Sokola.

Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel in 2006, when she was 19 years old. But the alleged abuse began in 2002, when she was 16 and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.

“Her first sexual experience was the defendant forcing himself on her,” Blumberg said.

During his three-hour closing, Aidala tried to poke holes in the testimony of the three accusers. He suggested prosecutors coached them to describe the sexual encounters, which he likened to “naked twister,” in a sinister light.

“They did it all to get the original sinner, the poster boy of the #MeToo movement,” Aidala said.

The #MeToo hashtag took off in 2017 after The New York Times and The New Yorker detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein that went back decades. It helped inspire a reckoning in Hollywood and beyond around sexual harassment.

Weinstein, Aidala said, made for an easy target. “He’s a fat dude — sorry, Harvey,” he said while Weinstein looked on.

“It’s not really a casting couch I thought it was,” Aidala added. “It’s different now. I know it sounds crazy, but he’s the one being used.”

Blumberg painted a far different picture during the prosecution's closing remarks.

“I want to remind you why we are here,” she said. “Because he raped three people.”

Sokola and Haley both claimed that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann told the court he raped her in 2013.

Weinstein, Blumberg said, “had tremendous control over Hollywood. He spoke, people listened. He decided who was in and who was out.”

“Remember, it’s not the person sitting here today in a wheelchair but this man, in Hollywood, who had the power and was in control,” Blumberg said.

Regardless of the verdict, Weinstein will most likely be returned to California, where he has to serve a 16-year sentence for a 2022 rape conviction. His lawyers filed an appeal of that conviction last year that is still in process.

During his latest trial, Weinstein has been allowed to stay at Bellevue Hospital, where he was being treated for a host of serious health issues.

In October, two sources told NBC News that Weinstein had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, an uncommon form of bone marrow cancer.

Weinstein was a Hollywood titan in the 1990s and the 2000s, when he and his brother, Bob, ran Miramax, the distributor of critically acclaimed independent movies like “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “The Crying Game,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Clerks” and box office successes like “Chicago” and “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”

In 1999, Weinstein won a best picture Oscar as one of the producers of “Shakespeare in Love.” And in the early 2010s, his second distribution label, The Weinstein Company, won back-to-back best picture Oscars for “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.”

But as Weinstein collected accolades, he was dogged by rumors that he preyed on his leading ladies and other women in the industry. By the time he was arrested, more than 80 women had accused him of sexual assault or harassment going back decades.

Just as he did at his trials, Weinstein doggedly denied the claims and insisted the encounters were consensual.",Entertainment
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/north-korea-appears-follow-south-suspending-loudspeaker-broadcasts-rcna212535,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea appears to have stopped loudspeakers near the border targeting South Korea, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Thursday.

The JCS said that North Korean loudspeaker broadcasts were not heard on Thursday, and the South Korean military was monitoring Pyongyang’s activities.

Seoul suspended its own loudspeaker broadcasts near the border targeting North Korea on Wednesday, after having resumed propaganda and K-pop blasts last year during a time of growing tension with its neighbor.

South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who took office this month vowing to resume dialogue with the North, ordered the move to ease tension, reduce military confrontation and build trust, his spokesperson said, as North Korea has refrained from provocations lately.

Those living near the heavily fortified border have opposed the loudspeaker broadcasts, which they blame for severe noise nuisance.

Seoul’s resumption last July of a round-the-clock campaign of loudspeaker broadcasts was in response to Pyongyang’s launch of balloons carrying trash over the border, the South’s military said at the time.

Pyongyang had said the balloons were retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send inflatables with anti-Pyongyang leaflets and other items across the border.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/colorado-funeral-home-owner-left-corpse-hearse-year-sentenced-18-month-rcna212526,"DENVER — A Colorado funeral homeowner who pleaded guilty to leaving a woman’s corpse in the back of a hearse for over a year and improperly stashing the cremated remains of at least 30 people has been sentenced to 18 months in prison, the Denver District Attorney’s Office announced.

Miles Harford, 34, pleaded guilty in April to one felony count of abuse of a corpse and one misdemeanor count of theft. He faced other counts, including forgery and theft, that were dismissed as part of his plea agreement.

His 18-month sentence is the maximum sentence under Colorado law for the charges.

“Nothing will ever undo the terrible pain that Miles Harford caused so many families, but it is our hope that this sentence will provide the family and friends of the deceased with some measure of justice,” Denver District Attorney John Walsh said in a statement Monday. “Harford systematically and shockingly violated his professional and moral obligations, and, for that, he is now being held accountable.”

Harford was arrested last year after the body of a woman named Christina Rosales, who died of Alzheimer’s at age 63, was found in the back of his hearse, covered in blankets. Her remains had been there for about 18 months. Authorities said he had provided the Rosales family with the cremated remains of a different person that he misrepresented as Rosales.

Police also found the cremated remains of other people stashed in boxes throughout Harford’s rental property, including in the crawlspace.

Prosecutors said he treated the bodies and remains “in a way that would outrage normal family sensibilities.”

Harford’s sentencing follows years of other gruesome funeral home cases in Colorado, including one where the owners were accused of storing nearly 200 bodies in a decrepit building and giving families fake cremated remains.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/attorneys-kilmar-abrego-garcia-argue-released-not-flight-risk-rcna212525,"Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man arrested by the government and sent to an El Salvador prison in error and then returned to the United States last week, argue in a court filing Wednesday that he man should be freed from jail pending trial.

“Mr. Abrego Garcia asks the Court for what he has been denied the past several months — due process,” attorneys for Abrego Garcia wrote in a memorandum opposing prosecutor’s efforts to keep him detained.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States on Friday to face federal charges that he was involved in a scheme to transport people in the United States who are not legally able to be in the country. He was in federal custody Wednesday night.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued in Wednesday's memo that he is not a flight risk, as prosecutors have argued. His attorneys say legal standards to keep him detained have not been met.

""The government isn’t even entitled to a detention hearing in this case — much less detention. Mr. Abrego Garcia should be released,"" his attorneys wrote.

An arraignment and detention hearing is scheduled for Friday in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia, 29, was arrested in Maryland on March 12, and the Department of Homeland Security claimed he was a member of the gang MS-13, which he denied.

The government then deported him Abrego Garcia to El Salvador where he was imprisoned in the Center for Terrorism Confinement — despite an immigration judge’s previous order that he not be sent to El Salvador.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States, which administration officials resisted.

The Trump administration then asked El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia to the United States last week to face human smuggling charges filed in Tennessee.

The case became a high-profile battle over whether the Trump administration was bound to return Abrego Garcia under the federal judge's order. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said at the White House in April that he would not return Abrego Garcia.

The matter went to the Supreme Court, which disputed the language of ""effectuate"" in the judge's order but ruled that the Trump administration was required to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia.

The two-count federal indictment unsealed in Tennessee charges Abrego Garcia with one count each of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.

The indictment alleges that from about 2016 to 2025, he and others conspired to bring migrants illegally to the United States from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and elsewhere, through Mexico and across the Texas-Mexico border.

Abrego Garcia and a co-conspirator “ordinarily picked up the undocumented aliens in Houston, Texas area” after they had crossed the border, the indictment alleges.

The pair then would transport “the undocumented aliens from Texas to other parts of the United States to further the aliens’ unlawful presence in the United States,” the indictment says.

Chris Newman, an attorney who represents Abrego Garcia's family, said last week that the Trump administration for months engaged in “a campaign of disinformation, defamation against Kilmar and his family.""",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sen-rand-paul-says-was-uninvited-white-house-picnic-breaks-trump-rcna212499,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was ""uninvited"" to an annual White House picnic typically attended by members of Congress and their families, framing the move to reporters Wednesday as retribution for his opposition to key components of President Donald Trump's agenda.

“They’re afraid of what I’m saying, so they think they’re going to punish me, I can’t go to the picnic, as if somehow that’s going to make me more conciliatory,” Paul said. “So it’s silly, in a way, but it’s also just really sad that this is what it’s come to. But petty vindictiveness like this, it makes you — it makes you wonder about the quality of people you’re dealing with.”

Paul, who said he attended picnics hosted by Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told reporters he called the White House on Wednesday to secure tickets to the annual picnic but was told he was not invited. He said he had family members flying to Washington to attend the event, including his son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-old grandson, who he noted owns a ""Make America Great Again"" hat.

“I just find this incredibly petty,” Paul told reporters. ""I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been an intellectual opponent, a public policy opponent, and he’s chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic and to say my grandson can’t come to the picnic.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether Paul was ever invited to the event and whether Trump was directly involved in the decision to ""uninvite"" him.

As Trump pushes Republicans to pass a package of measures to fund much of his domestic agenda by Independence Day, Paul is among the Senate Republicans poised to make that milestone unreachable, joining fiscal hawks in the party to balk at legislation the Congressional Budget Office estimates said would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit.

In addition to his belief that the funding package would ""explode the debt,"" Paul has criticized spending cuts in the bill as ""wimpy and anemic,"" called planned Medicaid changes in the legislation ""bad strategy"" and proposed cutting billions of dollars for Trump's border wall from the bill.

“In private, there’s quite a few people in there who actually do think we could save some money and are open-minded to it and believe the administration should justify the numbers,” Paul told reporters after a two-hour meeting on the bill Wednesday. “Even if you’re supportive, and I am supportive of border security, but I’m just not supportive of a blank check.”

Paul said this week he plans to vote no on the legislation and speculated Wednesday that that might be among the reasons the invitation was rescinded.

“I’m arguing from a true belief and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse, and they choose to react by uninviting my grandson to the picnic,” Paul said. “I don’t know, I just think it really makes me lose a lot of respect I once had for Donald Trump.”

Trump has frequently lashed out at Paul in response to the sustained opposition, deriding him on Truth Social for his criticisms.

""Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting 'NO' on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not,"" Trump wrote last week.

Paul has emerged as a chief critic of Trump’s fiscal policy, and he has intensely criticized his decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, arguing they will push the country into a recession.

Paul, a libertarian conservative, was one of four Republican senators to back a Democratic resolution to block the implementation of Trump's Canadian tariffs, predicting at the time that the import penalties would ""threaten us with a recession"" and calling Trump's decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners ""a terrible, terrible idea."" The effort has so far stalled in the House.

Paul also joined Democrats in introducing a bipartisan resolution to undo the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed on dozens of countries, this time by terminating the national emergency he declared to implement the global penalties, arguing that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority.

“Tariffs are taxes, and the power to tax belongs to Congress—not the president. Our Founders were clear: tax policy should never rest in the hands of one person,” Paul said in a statement about the bipartisan effort. “Abusing emergency powers to impose blanket tariffs not only drives up costs for American families but also tramples on the Constitution. It’s time Congress reasserts its authority and restores the balance of power.”

That effort failed to pass the Senate.

Paul's differences with Trump even extend to the military parade taking place Saturday, which he likened to parades in countries led by dictators.

""I wouldn't have done it,"" Paul said Tuesday. ""The images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea, we were proud not to be that.""

But still, in the face of his criticisms of Trump, Paul appeared to view the rescinded invitation as a shock, noting that even Democratic lawmakers remain invited to the White House picnic.

""I think I’m the first senator in the history of United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,” Rand told reporters. ""Literally, every Democrat is invited, every Republican is invited, and to say that my family is no longer welcome, kind of sad, actually.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hotel-nights-diddy-newsletter-rcna212355,"This is a free article for Diddy on Trial newsletter subscribers. Sign up to get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial.

U.S. government prosecutors have presented the drug-dazed, marathon sexual encounters known as “freak offs” as part of Diddy’s sweeping criminal conspiracy. But in a forceful cross-examination of Diddy’s ex-girlfriend “Jane” today, his legal team attempted to recast the “freak offs” as consensual trysts.

Here’s what you need to know about Jane’s fifth day on the stand:

Jane, answering questions from defense attorney Teny Geragos, said she initiated some “freak offs” with Diddy. Diddy’s lawyers entered as evidence photos of a room, decorated by Jane, filled with rose petals and balloons. When asked if she suggested a “hotel night” with two other men on that occasion, Jane said yes. “Yes, that was my suggestion,” she replied. Diddy was “excited about that.”

In late August 2022, after Jane had a tryst with Diddy and a sex worker named Paul, she told the rapper how much she enjoyed such sexual encounters. Jane texted Diddy that she was “having so much fun,” adding that she would “never take this for granted and will always make sure you are taken care of.”

Jane wept on the stand after recounting telling Diddy in a text message that he was a “blessing” in her life. “I have never had a man take care of me like you do,” Jane wrote to Diddy a day after one of their “hotel nights.” She added: “You’re the reason for my child’s joy, it means the world to us, I love you baby.”

Jane testified she urged Diddy to stay off drugs and eat healthy food for 30 days. Diddy suggested a “sobriety party” — a “hotel night” without drugs, she said. The October 2023 party lasted between 12 and 18 hours; Jane had sex with three men, she testified. “I resent him for how much I loved him and couldn’t say no to him,” she said. “I resent him for all of it.”

🔎 The view from inside

By Adam Reiss, Chloe Melas and Katherine Koretski

The prosecutors are seeking to remove one of the jurors — Juror #6 — who Diddy’s defense lawyers claim is among the panel’s Black members. It’s not exactly clear what’s behind the prosecution’s request, though it has cited a “lack of candor.”

“We were very reluctant to put in this letter. It appeared to be a lack of candor with the court that raises serious issues with us,” Maurene Comey, one of the prosecutors, told the court today. “We did not want to do this. We were compelled to do that.”

In other news: Diddy, wearing what appeared to be a light orange sweater and khaki pants, stood up and faced the audience in the courtroom before proceedings got started today. He seemed to be mouthing words to someone.

https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/shadow-fed-chair-coming-markets-might-react-rcna212424,"Under normal circumstances, moderating inflation and a weakening labor market would make an easy case for interest rate cuts.

But these aren’t normal times, and a scattering of headwinds on the horizon have made Federal Reserve officials leery of easing monetary policy for fear that the inflation fight isn’t over.

That sentiment is setting up an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank that could result in President Donald Trump taking the unusual step of naming a “shadow” chair whose responsibility it would be to watch over the Fed and Chair Jerome Powell until a permanent chief can be installed next year.

There is “fresh buzz” around the idea that Trump could announce his choice to succeed Powell soon, “as a shadow Fed chair in the interim,” until the central bank chief’s term ends, Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore, said in a note Wednesday.

“The idea would be to accelerate the timeframe over which the administration can put its stamp on the Fed and influence rates markets while avoiding the nuclear option of trying to fire Powell,” Guha wrote.

The practicality of such a move is sketchy. There are no imminent vacancies on the Fed’s board of governors — save for Powell, a frequent Trump target whose term as head of the central bank expires in May 2026, though his governorship runs until 2028.

Moreover, the impact of such a “shadow chair” likely would be minimal. It takes seven votes on the Federal Open Market Committee to move policy, and it would be hard to find more than one or two right now who would be in favor of the aggressive interest rate cuts Trump is seeking.

Still, at least telegraphing now who he wants as chair could sent an important message to markets about the path Trump wants to see the Fed to take. The stakes were raised Wednesday following a comparatively benign inflation report showing prices up just 0.1% in May, and after Vice President JD Vance joined Trump in urging the Fed to cut rates.

The stakes for a new chair

The candidate list for chair seems to have been narrowed, and Trump noted Friday that he expects to make his preference public soon. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

The list of apparent finalists includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Each has assets and liabilities, but the most important quality could be a tilt towards sharply lower rates, with an aggressive timetable.

“I think Trump’s going to pick someone who’s going to be uber-dovish,” billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones said during a Bloomberg News interview Wednesday. “We are fiscally constrained. We’re going to have budget deficits of 6% plus [compared to gross domestic product] as far as the eye can see. One of the major offsets if I was the president would be to lower my interest rate costs by appointing a Fed chair who is as dovish as could possibly be.”

Powell has been reluctant to push for cuts until the longer-term effects of Trump’s tariffs can be better gauged.

As Jones sees it, Trump has no other choice than to swing away from the moderate-to-hawkish Powell with the U.S. in a “debt trap” that eventually will cause a market revolt.

The budget deficit is heading toward $2 trillion for 2025 and actually is above 6% of GDP. Costs to finance the $36 trillion debt are estimated at $1.2 trillion this year and likely could be headed north of that as Treasury yields remain lofty. The easiest way for the U.S. to ease some of that burden would be Fed rate cuts that at least would ease some of those financing costs, which are running higher than any other budget category except Social Security and Medicare.

So which way does Trump turn?

Evaluating the candidates

Guha, the Evercore analyst, sees positives and negatives in each prospective candidate.

Warsh, he said, “has direct Fed policy experience, is well-known to markets and Fed officials, and has the benefit of being perceived as being independent while maintaining cordial and constructive relations with the Trump administration.”

His downside: A leaning toward hawkishness on inflation and away from expansionary balance sheet policies that have been the Fed’s hallmark since the financial crisis of 2008.

On Bessent, who emerged this week as a favorite, according to a Bloomberg report, his upside is market bona fides and stature as the “adult in the room” in the organized chaos of the Trump administration. However, a lack of monetary policy experience and perception of being “too close to the Trump administration, and not sufficiently independent,” could work against him perception-wise, Guha said.

More of a longshot, Hassett has solid economic credentials but limited monetary policy experience and might, Guha said, also be perceived as being too close to the administration.

Finally, Waller has the benefit of a folksy demeanor while his recent statements advocating “good news” rate cuts later this year could put him in good standing with Trump. However, he could pay a price for supporting the 50 basis point rate cut last September, ahead of the November presidential election.

For Trump, the challenge will be to pick someone credible who shares his vision on lower rates and easier policy and who can get through a Senate confirmation where Republicans hold the advantage, albeit a fragile one, and leadership that still wants an independent central bank.

“Hopefully, whoever is selected is an individual that feels strongly that monetary policy should be set consistent with the dual mandate and not be politically influenced,” former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said during a CNBC interview Wednesday. “But that remains to be seen.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-murder-trial-defense-john-okeefe-rcna212455,"Lawyers for Karen Read rested their case Wednesday, nearly two weeks after they began mounting a defense that sought to undermine allegations that she drunkenly backed her SUV into her boyfriend, a Boston police officer, and left him for dead three years ago.

The case, which prompted intense media coverage and allegations of law enforcement misconduct that led to the firing of the case’s lead investigator, could be with the jury in Dedham, Massachusetts, by the end of the week.

Read’s sensational first trial ended nearly one year ago with a jury unable to reach a unanimous verdict on charges of second-degree murder and other crimes in connection with the Jan. 29, 2022, death of John O’Keefe.

The defense did not call key figures central to the theory it laid out in those initial proceedings — that Read was the victim of a biased police investigation and a plot that sought to frame her for the killing — and opted instead for a series of experts whose testimony sought to dismantle the prosecution’s evidence.

Among them were three crash reconstruction specialists and two pathologists. Also called to the witness stand was a snowplow driver who offered what was perhaps the defense's most direct challenge to the case Norfolk County special prosecutor Hank Brennan had presented.

Blizzardlike conditions descended on the Boston area on Jan. 29, and the driver, Brian Loughran, testified that before the snow grew heavy, he made multiple passes on the residential street in Canton where O’Keefe was found unresponsive.

O’Keefe was discovered near a flagpole in the front yard of a now-retired Boston police sergeant, Brian Albert, shortly after 6 a.m. — a little over three hours after, Loughran said, he first passed the home in his plow, nicknamed “Frankentruck” for what he described as its mismatch of parts.

Loughran said he knew the Albert family — he used to deliver pizzas for Brian Albert’s brother — and he testified that he could clearly see from his truck to Albert’s front door.

“What was on the ground in the area of the flagpole?” defense attorney David Yanetti asked.

“Nothing,” Loughran responded.

“Did you see a 6-foot-1, 216-pound man lying on that lawn?” Yanetti asked.

“No,” Loughran said.

After a night of drinking, O’Keefe was supposed to have gone to a gathering at Albert’s home early Jan. 29. Brennan has said he never made it inside. Although prosecutors presented no direct evidence of the collision that they said mortally wounded O’Keefe, vehicle data presented at trial showed Read suddenly reversing her Lexus at 12:32 a.m. at 24 mph in front of Albert’s home.

An accident reconstruction expert called by Brennan testified that dozens of abrasions found on O’Keefe’s right arm were consistent with injuries caused by the broken right taillight on Read’s SUV.

Read has said she dropped O’Keefe off outside Albert’s home and watched him enter. Her lawyers have said he was most likely beaten at the gathering — perhaps because she had recently flirted with, then ghosted, a federal agent who was also at the event — before O'Keefe was bitten by Albert’s German shepherd, dragged outside and left in the snow. (Albert and the agent, Brian Higgins, have denied playing roles in O'Keefe's death.)

One of the defense witnesses, a former emergency room doctor and forensic pathologist who said she had seen hundreds of dog bites in her career, testified that the dozens of abrasions on O’Keefe’s arm were not from a broken taillight but from a dog.

The defense’s final witness, a biomedical engineer who examined whether O’Keefe’s injuries were the result of a collision, testified Wednesday that they were not. Experiments conducted for the case using crash test dummies showed that at speeds of 24 mph, there most likely would have been more damage to Read’s car and to O’Keefe’s arm, said the engineer, Andrew Rentschler.

Absent from the witness stand were three people whose testimony played an outsized role in the first trial: Albert, Higgins and former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor.

Proctor, who was fired after an internal investigation found that he sent derogatory texts about Read and shared confidential investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel, acknowledged during the first trial that he said “unprofessional” things about Read. But he rejected the defense’s claims that he led a biased investigation.

The defense mentioned Proctor repeatedly during Read’s retrial, with defense attorney Alan Jackson at one point asking his supervisor whether his conduct tainted their examination of O’Keefe’s death.

“The investigation was done with honor and integrity, and the evidence pointed in one direction,” State Police Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik responded.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/david-hogg-dnc-vice-chair-vote-malcolm-kenyatta-rcna212023,"Progressive activist David Hogg said he won’t seek to continue as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after the DNC called for a redo of the February election that elevated him to the post.

Shortly after the DNC announced it would hold new elections Thursday for two vice chair positions held by Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as a result of a procedural challenge, Hogg announced he wouldn’t be a candidate.

The decision comes amid a public spat with the DNC and its chairman, Ken Martin, over Hogg’s decision to support primary challenges to Democratic incumbents, a spat that loomed over the vote even though it wasn’t directly related to the challenge that ultimately led the party to call for a new election.

Hogg made the announcement in a lengthy statement that criticized the Democratic Party for a lack of vision and a refusal to pass the torch to the next generation. But his discussion about the DNC and the vice chairmanship specifically was more muted.

""I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair — and it’s okay to have disagreements. What isn’t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,"" he said in the statement.

""Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.""

Martin praised Hogg's for the party in a brief statement, saying, ""I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.”

“I commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map,"" Martin said.

The DNC had voted hours earlier to accept a recommendation from its Credentials Committee that the party hold two new vice chair elections because it found the DNC mistakenly created an advantage for the two male candidates, Hogg and Kenyatta, as it managed the internal elections at the end of a marathon February party meeting in Washington.

On Wednesday evening, the DNC announced that 75% of the votes its members cast in a virtual election were in favor of the recommendation, a vote of 294-99. It said 89% of its members participated in the virtual election.

Because DNC rules require equal gender representation on its executive committee, not including the party chair, the results of elections in February meant the DNC had to elect at least one man to its final two vice chair slots. But instead of holding individual votes for each position, one to be filled by a man and one by a candidate of any gender, the party decided to hold one vote to decide who took the final two slots.

Oklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in February, petitioned the DNC for a redo, claiming the decision to combine the ballots unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta over the female candidates who were eligible for the final vice chair slot.

Though Free’s challenge was filed well before Hogg’s public spat with Martin, Hogg framed the decision last month as proof that the party was trying to strip him of his title over his support for primary challenges to Democratic incumbents. Martin and Kenyatta vehemently disagreed with his framing: Martin blamed a “procedural error” from “before I became chair” for the episode, and Kenyatta criticized Hogg for distracting from the party’s work by arguing the vote amounted to personal retribution.

After the new election was called, Kenyatta said in a statement that “now we can almost bring this chapter to a close,” adding that he looked forward to “making my case to DNC members and our party as a whole” in the snap election.

“We need a strong Democratic Party and I hope we come out of this stronger and focused on the work ahead,” he said.

With Hogg's decision to step aside, Kenyatta is assured of winning his vice chair position back by the end of the week. The party will effectively be replacing Hogg with the winner of a subsequent vice chair election among the three candidates who were on the final ballot in February.

Tensions between Hogg and the party have been brewing for months, since he telegraphed his decision to back Democratic primary challenges through a political group he started, Leaders We Deserve. Hogg, who rose to prominence as a political activist after he was one of the victims of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, argued in his statement Wednesday night that his mission to push the Democratic Party toward ""a new vision for the future and leaders to bring us there"" was most important to him, as he accused Democrats of thinking too small.

""After seeing a serious lack of vision from Democratic leaders, too many of them asleep at the wheel, and Democrats dying in office that have helped to hand Republicans an expanded majority, it became clear that Leaders We Deserve had to start primarying incumbents and directly challenging the culture of seniority politics that brought our party to this place to help get our party into fighting shape again,"" he said.

Ahead of the vote, Politico published a short clip of an internal Democratic Party call on which Martin vented his frustration with Hogg, saying the fight has “essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to.”

The leak prompted another round of finger-pointing, with prominent DNC members accusing Hogg or his allies of orchestrating it. Hogg vehemently denied that and published a screenshot that he said showed his text messages with the reporter who published the story.

Even if Hogg had decided to run again and won his seat back, Martin has said he would propose a neutrality pledge for officers that could have forced Hogg to choose between his party role and his role with the outside group he founded.",World

“This has happened to me, I’m going to say — and I don’t think I’m exaggerating — six times where I’ve had different women in my life... like a girl in my choir class was like, ‘Oh, I’m going to start watching your show. I haven’t seen it yet. My dad told me to watch it,’” she said exclusively to Soboroff, who laughed.

“I’m not joking. Everybody’s dad has seen this show and is telling them to watch it, like a bunch of my friends,” she added.

Brody agreed. “Yeah, parents and grandparents,” he said.

“Dads love it!” Bell added.

Brody and Bell star in “Nobody Wants This” and play a devout rabbi and an agnostic sex podcaster, respectively, who fall in love in the most unconventional way.

The series premiered on Netflix in September 2024 and then it was renewed for another season in October of that same year. Season 2 is now set to premiere this October.

The singer and TikTok star, who just released her self-titled debut album on June 6, has dropped the name “Rae” from her professional moniker and is now known simply as Addison.

“I said it in an interview, I was just like, ‘Oh, I think I’ve grown past being called Addison Rae,’” Addison told host Quenlin Blackwell during a June 8 appearance on Blackwell’s “Feeding Starving Celebrities” YouTube series.

“Then the album being named ‘Addison’ kind of was a tie-in for that,” she added.

The “Diet Pepsi” singer, 24, said there is also a more practical reason behind her decision. “I just am tired of also signing Addison Rae. It’s really long. I just would rather sign Addison,” she said, laughing. “And then I was like, ‘Yeah, it just makes more sense because, like, it’s going back to the roots really.’”

Still, Addison, who was born Addison Rae Easterling, said she won’t be upset if longtime friends and fans still think of her as Addison Rae.

“Whoever knows me as Addison Rae and knew me as Addison Rae will always know me as that,” she said.

Addison joins a growing list of celebrities who have opted to tweak their professional names during the past year.

The Trump factor looms over New Jersey’s newly set race for governor

By Steve Kornacki

The matchup for New Jersey’s gubernatorial election is set, but looming over the contest will be a name that won’t be on any ballot: Donald Trump.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who secured the Democratic nomination in Tuesday’s primary, is already running ads that attack Republican Jack Ciattarelli for his ties to the president. Ciattarelli, who was also the GOP’s nominee in 2021, romped to victory in his party’s primary after successfully cultivating Trump’s support.

In focusing on Trump, Democrats have history on their side. New Jersey voters have a strong tendency to elect governors from the party that doesn’t control the White House. This has been the case in all but two races over the past four decades.

Plus, Democrats have run this playbook successfully in New Jersey before. Eight years ago, during Trump’s first term, Gov. Phil Murphy scored a 14-point win over Republican Kim Guadagno. Murphy sought to tie Guadagno to Trump, whose approval rating in New Jersey that fall stood at just 33%. (Murphy was also aided by the cratering popularity of outgoing Republican Gov. Chris Christie.)

Republicans are counting on the Trump factor playing differently this time around. And, at least for now, there are some key variables they can point to with optimism.

One is the result of last year’s presidential race, when Trump lost New Jersey by 6 points to Kamala Harris. That was a far cry from his 16-point loss in 2020 and his 14-point defeat in 2016. From the outset of the 2017 gubernatorial race, it was obvious that Trump would be a major electoral liability for the GOP. That’s not as clear this time around.

In fact, a PIX11/Emerson College poll conducted a few weeks ago showed Trump with a 47% job approval rating in New Jersey. That’s far higher than he fared during the 2017 campaign, or for that matter, at any point during his first term. It’s also higher than the 40% approval rating for Murphy, who is term-limited and provides Ciattarelli with his own opportunity to tie his opponent to an unpopular leader.

There’s also some history Republicans can point to. Democrats have controlled the New Jersey governorship for two consecutive terms now, with Sherrill seeking to make it three. This is the fifth time since 1981 that one of the two parties has tried for a third straight term. They all failed.

Nationwide protests provide split-screen for Trump’s upcoming military parade

By Peter Nicholas

President Donald Trump is getting the parade he wanted showcasing America’s military power — but he’ll also be getting mass protests exposing the nation’s partisan divisions.

The tanks and artillery launchers rolling through Washington on Saturday will honor the Army’s 250th anniversary, which falls on the day Trump turns 79.

But in Washington and in all 50 states, organizers are scheduled to stage protests that could dwarf the parade in size. A coalition of pro-democracy, labor and liberal activists is arranging a full day of counterprogramming to make the case that Trump is hijacking the Army celebration to venerate himself.

The parade is happening at a fraught moment when Trump has drawn the military — among the nation’s most trusted institutions — into a tense standoff in Los Angeles over his aggressive efforts to deport people living in the United States illegally. The Trump administration this week activated about 700 Marines to help quell demonstrations over his immigration enforcement methods, despite warnings from California officials that he is inflaming the situation.

Catch up on NBC News' latest coverage of Trump’s deportation plans and the protests in response:

ICE is preparing to deploy its Special Response Teams to five cities run by Democratic leaders, according to two sources familiar with the planning of the future operations.

The Trump administration is telling immigration judges — who report to the executive branch and are not part of the independent judiciary — to dismiss pending cases as a tactic for speeding up arrests.

During an interview with NBC’s “Nightly News” anchor Tom Llamas, White House border czar Tom Homan said that protests in Los Angeles are making immigration raids more “difficult” and more “dangerous.”

Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott said he’ll deploy the National Guard across the state “to ensure peace and order” ahead of a planned protest in San Antonio.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom warned that “democracy is under assault” in a speech blasting Trump’s immigration tactics.

A federal grand jury indicted Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., on charges stemming from a confrontation with law enforcement at an ICE detention center in Newark last month.

The way Trump has responded to protests in California is very different than how he treated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump’s new travel ban causes rift with Afghanistan war veterans

By Andrea Mitchell

Little noticed amid the uproar over the ICE raids in Los Angeles this week is the imposition of a travel ban 2.0 — a retooled version of President Donald Trump’s first-term policy, modified to avoid legal challenges.

“We want to keep bad people out of our country,” Trump said.

The last time around, the Trump White House had to rewrite the proposed ban three times before it passed Supreme Court muster. This time, the administration released fact sheets to show they were singling out countries whose citizens had high rates of overstaying their visas or don’t properly screen their citizens for terrorism, not because most of the 12 countries banned are in Africa or the Middle East — prompting accusations of racial motivation, which would be unconstitutional.

While not facing immediate legal challenges, the decision to bar travelers from Afghanistan in particular is outraging many U.S. veterans, including Trump supporters, who say they could not have survived the war without their Afghan translators. They say the U.S. is abandoning its Afghan allies and their families, who are being attacked, imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured by the Taliban for their past association with the U.S.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of U.S. veterans and advocacy groups, told me: “The Taliban has made it very clear through their actions, not their words, what’s going to happen to them. We get photos and videos every week of people being hunted down and killed.”

We met an Afghan man who worked as a translator with the U.S. military for seven years who we can’t identify without putting his family at risk. He got a special visa to come to the U.S, became a citizen and enlisted in the Marines to return to Afghanistan for another tour in Helmand Province. He spent years trying to bring his siblings and aging parents to the U.S. from Afghanistan to escape retaliation. They were approved last December and told to prepare to travel within days.

Now the travel ban has shut the door. He told me when Trump announced the ban, “For the first week, I couldn’t go to work. I laid in bed, I was shocked for a week.” He added, “I want to see my parents. They’re getting old and I feel so bad. I cannot forgive myself if they pass and I can’t see them.”

He blames himself. But critics of the travel ban say it’s the U.S. that went back on its word — something they warn future allies will remember when America wants their help.

https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/wi-group-sues-elon-musk-alleging-million-dollar-giveaways-bribes-rcna212377,"A Wisconsin watchdog group has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk claiming that he unlawfully bribed voters with million-dollar checks and $100 giveaways in the state’s latest Supreme Court election.

Wisconsin Democracy Campaign — a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that investigates election transparency — along with two Wisconsin voters, filed the suit against Musk, his super PAC America PAC and another Musk-owned entity called the United States of America Inc. In the suit, the plaintiffs claimed that Musk and his entities violated state laws that prohibit vote bribery and unauthorized lotteries. It also accuses Musk of conducting civil conspiracy and acting as a public nuisance. Musk and America PAC did not respond to a request for comment.

“In the context of an election for Wisconsin’s highest court, election bribery—providing more than $1 to induce electors (that is, voters) to vote— undermines voters’ faith in the validity of the electoral system and the independence of the judiciary,” the suit reads.

The complaint alleges that Musk violated state laws in giving away $100 to voters who signed a petition “in opposition to activist judges” and handing out million-dollar checks to those who signed the petition. The suit says that those who had won the checks had voted for candidate Brad Schimel. At a town hall in Green Bay, Musk gave away million-dollar checks to two people, both of whom the suit claims voted for Schimel. In a video America PAC posted on X, one of the winners said he had voted for Schimel and encouraged others to do the same.

“Everyone needs to do what I just did, sign the petition, refer your friends, and go out to vote for Brad Schimel,” the winner, Nicholas Jacobs, said in the video.

The suit mentions that Musk had said the $1 million awards would be given “in appreciation” for those “taking the time to vote.”

Despite Musk’s America PAC spending over $12 million on Schimel’s campaign, candidate Susan Crawford won the race.

Before the race had been called, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a similar lawsuit against Musk over his involvement in the state Supreme Court election, but a county judge declined to immediately hold a hearing. A Pennsylvania judge similarly declined a request to block Musk’s million-dollar giveaways in the state. During the presidential election, Musk’s America PAC had also given out million-dollar checks to people registered to vote in swing states, which the Justice Department had warned could be illegal.

Musk defended his giveaways during the presidential election despite the allegations of unlawfulness by saying that those who signed the petition weren’t given the money as a prize and that chance “was not involved here.” Those who signed the petition were instead America PAC spokespeople with the “opportunity to earn” $1 million.

“Make no mistake: an eligible voter’s opportunity to earn is not the same thing as a chance to win,” Musk said, according to Reuters.

Jeff Mandell, the co-founder of Law Forward — the law firm that filed the suit on behalf of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign — said in an interview with NBC News that this lawsuit has the advantage of additional time.

“The election is over. Some passions have cooled, and we are bringing this in a normal posture, asking the court to go through its normal procedure,” Mandell said. “We are confident that we’ll get a complete and fair adjudication.”

The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s lawsuit also seeks to bar Musk from “replicating any such unlawful conduct in relation to future Wisconsin elections.”

“Almost everyone who was watching closely or saw what was happening here in Wisconsin in that very tight period was pretty horrified, and would say things like, ‘Well, this can’t possibly be legal,’ or, ‘He can’t possibly get away with this,’” Mandell said.

“That’s really the purpose of this lawsuit, is to make sure that a court does say — in accord with both the law and I think people across the political spectrum's intuition — that this is not legal conduct, this is not consistent with how our democracy works, and to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”",Technology

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/boost-trump-jack-ciattarelli-pivots-new-jersey-governors-race-rcna211208,"DOVER, N.J. — Jack Ciattarelli won Tuesday’s Republican primary for governor in New Jersey in part by touting President Donald Trump’s endorsement. But he is now looking to make his campaign against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill about a different executive.

Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, name-checked Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration five times in a nearly seven-minute interview with NBC News at a Colombian bakery here Wednesday. He mentioned Trump’s name only once, when prompted, and he went on to call Sherrill “out of touch” with key state issues like affordability, education and immigration policies, suggesting she would be an extension of Murphy’s administration if she wins the governorship.

“This race is all about New Jersey,” Ciattarelli said. “My opponent is going to want to talk about Donald Trump every day of the week, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security — by the way, the way to save those programs is by getting rid of the fraud. I’ve got to hit the reset button here in New Jersey come January. We’re going to keep the focus on New Jersey.”

“What people want to hear about [is] what are we doing about property taxes? What are we doing about public education? What are we doing about our infrastructure? What are we doing about the lawlessness? What are we doing about the overdevelopment? What are we doing about the cost of electricity? Those are all the failures of the Murphy administration. Mikie Sherrill has supported every one of his policies,” Ciattarelli added.

Ciattarelli is focusing on Murphy as he tries to win over independent voters and disaffected Democrats in the traditionally blue state. Trump significantly improved on his margin last year compared with 2020, but he still lost New Jersey by percentage 6 points. Ciattarelli called out those voters in his victory speech Tuesday night, and on Wednesday he laid out how he plans to win them over.

“They’ve had it, as have I,” Ciattarelli said. “They’ve had it with sanctuary cities. They’ve had it with us being a sanctuary state. They’ve had it with our property taxes. We saw what went on on our Jersey Shore over the Memorial Day weekend, flash mobs, because we don’t support our local police. It’s across the board. Look what’s happened in education. We just slipped from two to 12 on the national report card because of the performance or lack thereof of our students.”

Ciattarelli is, of course, still linked to Trump, who endorsed him and helped consolidate Republican primary voters behind him, helping fuel his resounding renomination. On Tuesday night at a victory party in Holmdel, voters who spoke to NBC News emphasized Trump’s endorsement as having “sealed the deal” for them.

“If he continues with Trump and doesn’t become like one of them RINOs [Republican In Name Only], if he continues going the right path, I think he’s going to do great,” a supporter said.

Ciattarelli said Wednesday that Trump is “really excited about the possibilities here in New Jersey. There’s an opportunity for us to win this year, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”

Sherrill suggested in her primary victory speech Tuesday night that she plans to tie Ciattarelli to Trump, referring to Ciattarelli as a “Trump lackey.”

“This country is too beautiful to be beholden to the cruelty and self-interest that Jack and Trump are trying to hoist on her,” she said.

Ciattarelli has been hesitant to publicly break with Trump. He said he supports Trump’s decision to federalize California’s National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles against immigration raids, despite objections from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“The first job of any elected official is public health and safety. If they feel the National Guard is needed, why not? I think our local police and our state police would welcome the National Guard here to help them,” Ciattarelli said.

Sherrill wrote Sunday on X that the Trump administration’s move was “a dangerous stunt designed to inflame divisions and further a political agenda” and that it was “disturbing” to see Ciattarelli applauding the decision.

“I think it’s a dangerous situation to put military on the streets of this country, trained in combat, as opposed to the police officers who know how to handle this,” Sherrill told reporters after she cast her primary ballot Tuesday, noting that a governor can ask the federal government for support.

“That is not the case here,” she said. “Gov. Newsom surged law enforcement in, and what Trump seems to be doing is trying to add fuel to the fire and really make a situation violent and bad. And I just think that’s completely unacceptable.”

Immigration is expected to be a top issue in the governor’s race, with around 1 in 4 New Jersey residents born in another country, according to census data. The first of several Ciattarelli campaign events Wednesday took place in a predominantly Latino area in Sherrill’s congressional district.

“Immigrants that are here legally want to achieve the American dream, and too many people right now don’t feel like they can do that here in New Jersey,” Ciattarelli said. “Whether it’s get the job of their dreams, get the education they want, raise a family, start a business, retire here, those are all the things that people are terribly insecure about.”

“Those are all the failures of the Murphy administration,” he added.

Ciattarelli, who lost a close race against Murphy in 2021, said this year is going to be different, in part because the state is not in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic.

https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/bessent-floats-extending-tariff-pause-countries-good-faith-trade-talks-rcna212470,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled the Trump administration’s openness on Wednesday to extending President Donald Trump’s current 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for the United States’ top trading partners, as long as they show “good faith” in ongoing trade negotiations.

The U.S. has 18 “important trading partners,” Bessent said at a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee in Washington. The Trump administration, he said, is “working toward deals” with those countries.

“It is highly likely,” said Bessent, that for those countries and trading blocs, like the European Union, “who are negotiating in good faith,” the United States would “roll the date forward to continue good faith negotiations.”

“If someone is not negotiating, then we will not,” he told the House’s tax writing committee.

Until now, Trump administration officials have not suggested that they are open to moving back the 90-day tariff pause without at least “terms of an agreement” before the pause expires.

Bessent’s remarks indicate that the Trump administration might be more inclined to shift the self-imposed deadline as it gets closer.

President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced on April 9, is set to end in less than a month.

Trump officials have repeatedly said that they are close to inking trade deals with half a dozen countries. But so far, the White House has only announced a formal trade agreement with the United Kingdom and a framework agreement with China.

The U.S.- China deal was announced earlier on Wednesday, but the full details of the agreement were unclear.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/-no-plan-b-republicans-make-daring-bet-debt-limit-rcna212311,"WASHINGTON — As Republicans barrel toward a critical deadline this summer to lift the debt ceiling, they say there’s no “Plan B” to avert an economically disastrous default if they fail to pass the massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda in time.

Congressional Republicans are eyeing increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion to $5 trillion so the government can keep borrowing to meet the country’s obligations. It's part of their broader domestic policy package, which the Senate needs to pass before it can go back through the House and ultimately to Trump's desk for his signature. And the GOP only has three votes to spare in both chambers.

“There is no Plan B,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday when asked by NBC News if he has a backup plan for the debt limit. “It’s Plan A. We have to get it done. Failure is not an option.”

It’s a risky gamble by GOP leaders, who are putting all their chips on passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the debt ceiling deadline.

“We’re going to get reconciliation done,” Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said when asked what the party’s fallback plan is on the debt ceiling. (Reconciliation refers to the budget process Republicans are using to pass their bill, which allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and cut Democrats out of the process.)

The Treasury Department has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling ""by mid-July"" to safely avoid default. The Congressional Budget Office projected this week that the deadline may be later, “between mid-August and the end of September,” although that won’t be official unless the Treasury Department agrees.

If Republicans fail to pass their sprawling bill in time, they would need to negotiate with Democrats to pass a standalone debt limit extension through the 60-vote process in the Senate.

But there have been no negotiations between party leaders on that front, according to Republican and Democratic aides with knowledge of the dynamics. One GOP aide said the party is “full steam ahead on Plan A” and suggested there may still be time to consider a fallback if they absolutely need to.

Some Republicans say it’s a deliberate tactic to drive up the urgency of passing their filibuster-proof bill.

“We should be set an expectation that we’re getting this done in July, and it includes the debt ceiling,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. “I think the minute you start talking about a backup plan, you’re going to have a backup plan.”

If Republican leaders eventually decide they want to cut a bipartisan deal on the debt ceiling, it’s unclear what — if anything — Democrats would demand.

Some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and Rep. Brendan Boyle, of Pennsylvania., have insisted on abolishing the debt limit entirely in order to prevent the full faith and credit of the United States from being used as leverage in policy negotiations. That's an idea Trump recently endorsed.

“I am very pleased to announce that, after all of these years, I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING,” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week. “The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe.”

But there's scant support within the GOP for it, as Republicans have found success using it to extract concessions from Democratic presidents in the past.

There's no indication that Democrats would respond in kind this year if Republicans came to them and asked for their votes on the debt ceiling.

“I’m not debating hypotheticals,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said when asked what he’d want in exchange.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/pregnant-us-citizen-went-hospital-immigration-agents-detained-rcna212033,"A 28-year-old woman set to give birth as early as next week spoke out about being detained by immigration authorities in California, even after she told agents she was a U.S. citizen.

Cary López Alvarado lost her balance as agents ""shoved her"" during her arrest over the weekend, she tearfully told NBC Los Angeles on Monday from a hospital bed. “That’s when I kind of leaned forward, trying to protect the stomach.”

López Alvarado told Telemundo 52, NBC’s sister station in Los Angeles, ""I was afraid that they were going to hurt me.""

Once she was back at home Tuesday, she told Noticias Telemundo, “I crouched down and held my belly, because I was scared they would hurt me. ... Three agents were grabbing me and trying to handcuff me.""

López Alvarado said she started experiencing sharp pains in her stomach after she was arrested and released Sunday and that she went to the hospital. With just one week left before her due date, her doctors said, they hospitalized López Alvarado for a day to monitor her and her baby, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Masked men wearing Border Patrol uniforms pulled up to a building’s private parking in the city of Hawthorne in marked U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicles Sunday after having followed a white pickup truck with two undocumented workers, one of whom is López Alvarado’s partner, Brian Nájera.

López Alvarado and her cousin Alberto Sandoval, who is also a U.S. citizen, opened the parking gate so Nájera and the other co-worker could o in. López Alvarado and Sandoval, as well as Nájera and the other co-worker, were in the building doing maintenance work.

López Alvarado said she and her cousin believed agents would need to show they had a warrant to be able to enter their workplace.

“They had us all surrounded,” López Alvarado told NBC Los Angeles on Monday.

López Alvarado captured her interactions with immigration enforcement agents on video.

In one video, she tells the agents: ""I'm gonna need you guys to leave. This is private property.""

As the agents ""were trying to forcefully open"" the gates, López Alvarado said, she ""was blocking the door,"" and ""I told them they were in private property.”

In another video, one of the agents responds: ""Excuse me, ma'am. You are interfering with my arrest. I'm doing my job. ... Can you please move away?""

""I'm not moving away,"" López Alvarado tells the agent.

López Alvarado said agents told her the parking wasn't private property and arrested her alongside her partner, her cousin and her co-worker.

In an email to NBC News on Tuesday night, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “Cary Lopez was arrested because she obstructed federal law enforcement by blocking access to a car that had two Guatemalan illegal aliens in it.""

According to the statement, ""during this incident, agents were assaulted, and an additional subject was taken into custody after he pushed an officer. Additionally, rioters began throwing wrenches and batteries at agents. Anyone who actively obstructs or assaults law enforcement, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

The Department of Homeland Security said that ""ICE enforcement officers are facing a 413% increase in assaults against them,"" which McLaughlin said was ""disgraceful.""

The arrests took place the same weekend immigration authorities conducted a series of raids in Southern California, arresting dozens of people and triggering five straight days of protests in Los Angeles.

Witnesses recorded the moment immigration authorities handcuffed López Alvarado. They shout at the agents ""let her go"" and ""she's pregnant.""

After Nájera was arrested and López Alvarado was detained, they were put in separate cars, she told Noticias Telemundo. She said immigration agents told her, ""Calm down, calm down, you’re pregnant. 'I said, how can I calm down?'” López Alvarado recounted through tears. She added she still hasn't heard from Nájera following his arrest.

She said agents told her she was taken into custody for trying to obstruct their operation.

“I wasn’t resisting or anything,” she said. “I can’t fight back; I’m pregnant.”

During the arrest, López Alvarado said, she told agents she was due on June 17. The agents responded, “'OK, your baby is going to be born here, but you're from Mexico, right?' And I told them no,” she said.

""I was born here,"" López Alvarado told Telemundo 52 in Spanish. ""I was born in Los Angeles; I was born in Hollywood Hospital.”

López Alvarado was released shortly after the arrest and taken to her home. She was told that agents would contact her later about the obstruction allegations. She said no one gave her any documents or citations in connection with the arrest.

Her cousin, Sandoval, was not released because he faces assault charges, his mother, María Alvarado, told Telemundo 52. ""My son didn't attack. He was attacked. There are videos. There's evidence,"" she said in Spanish.",Entertainment
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/daughter-gilgo-beach-suspect-believes-dad-killer-wife-isnt-sold-rcna212462,"A just-released Peacock documentary, “The Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,” takes viewers inside the Long Island home of alleged serial killer Rex Heuermann.

And for the first time, both Heuermann’s estranged wife and his daughter discuss the case, highlighting a difference of opinion on the question of the architect’s guilt.

“No freaking way is this man going out, soliciting sex from sex workers, killing them and dumping them on Gilgo Beach,” said Heuermann’s wife of 27 years, Asa Ellerup.

Ellerup’s daughter, Victoria, on the other hand, seems torn throughout the three-episode documentary, saying she’s “on the fence” about her father’s innocence.

“This is my dad. I love him as my dad. The hate is the other side of him that came out,” Victoria Heuermann said.

In the final episode, however, the documentary’s producers reveal in an on screen statement that “Victoria now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer.”

In an interview Tuesday, Victoria Heuermann’s lawyer confirmed her mindset.

“Being front and center during this process, she has received overwhelming amounts of evidence just like we all have that lead to an inescapable conclusion,” said attorney Vess Mitev.

Of Ellerup’s ongoing doubts about her husband’s guilt, Ellerup’s lawyer Bob Macedonio said: “Even if Rex is found guilty or pleads guilty, I don’t know if she’ll ever believe that the man she knows was capable of those crimes.”

Rex Heuermann, 61, is charged with the murders of seven women, all sex workers, dating to 1993.

Through his attorney, Michael Brown, Heuermann has maintained his innocence. He remains in the Suffolk County jail, with no trial date scheduled.

In the documentary, both Ellerup and Victoria Heuermann expressed surprise at the July 2023 arrest and subsequent criminal charges that changed their lives.

“They said we have evidence your father murdered all these women and your home is a crime scene. Never imagined I’d be hearing that in my life,” said Victoria Heuermann, who was working in her dad’s Manhattan office at the time of his arrest.

During the documentary, Ellerup, her lawyer and two children visit the basement in Massapequa Park where prosecutors say some of the murders may have taken place.

“It’s absolutely absurd. They’re just allegations,” says Ellerup.

“He must have had to be Superman for us not to notice ever,” said Victoria Heuermann of her dad.

Rex Heuermann’s voice is heard during the documentary as he speaks to his family by phone from the Suffolk jail. Among other things, he discusses what he had for dinner that night.

A man interviewed for the documentary, who describes himself as Heuermann’s best friend, discusses going to visit the alleged killer in the Suffolk jail.

“I said, ‘Did you do it?’ And then he teared up a little bit and started crying. And that’s when I get the feeling he did it,” said David Jimenez, a Port Washington architect who said he bonded with Heuermann over their love of guns and conservative politics.

https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/soccer/fifa-world-cup-us-mens-national-team-one-year-out-rcna208835,"Tony Meola knows the pressure of competing in front of his home fans. Back in 1994, when the United States hosted the FIFA World Cup, Meola, the national team’s starting goalkeeper, and his teammates had not one but two jobs: beat the competition and help grow the game.

“It was relentless,” he told NBC News. “Twenty-four hours a day for a year leading into the World Cup. Promotion of the game, events. We never stopped.”

His team did its part off the field — the event shattered attendance records even though soccer wasn’t the most popular sport at the time — and it made it out of the group stage before it lost 1-0 to eventual champion Brazil. Though it wasn’t the result it wanted, that squad is credited for helping generate major interest and participation in the sport stateside.

Meola had dreams of one day seeing the U.S. men’s national team become perennial contenders. But more than 30 years later, with the country (along with Canada and Mexico) hosting the 2026 World Cup next June, he says there’s still as much up in the air as there was two decades ago.

“I don’t feel like we’re ready right now,” Meola, now an analyst for CBS Sports Golazo Network, said of the current U.S. team. “I want to see progression over the next year and go into [the World Cup] with as few question marks as possible, not going in there sort of fearing what’s going to happen.”

Meola is far from the only former USMNT player to share some skepticism one year out. His co-hosts on the soccer podcast “Call It What You Want,” Charlie Davies and Jimmy Conrad, also expressed concern. So did Fox Sports, MLS and Apple commentator Maurice Edu.

Taylor Twellman, the lead soccer analyst for Apple TV, put it more bluntly.

When he was asked how the United States stacks up right now with the top countries in the world, he told NBC News: “They’re not in the conversation with any of them. ... They don’t see themselves as a contender.”

When North America was awarded the rights to the 2026 World Cup in June 2018, Carlos Cordeiro, then the president of U.S. Soccer, called it a “rare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport.”

It also guaranteed more eyeballs on the host countries. According to FIFA, the average global live audience for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was 175 million viewers. The final between Argentina and France drew 1.5 billion viewers, dramatically more than the most recent Super Bowl (127.7 million).

And with the 2026 World Cup final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, this was the perfect time to showcase just how far the U.S. men’s team has come. Especially with the “Golden Generation” of players entering their prime.

That term — attached to rising stars like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, Gio Reyna, Timothy Weah, Antonee Robinson, Matt Turner and Tyler Adams — recognizes what was expected to be the best core in program history.

They showed glimpses of brilliance during the 2022 World Cup, a run that ended in the Round of 16, but they were all young. Now, four years older, with experience both internationally and for European clubs, they are expected to help lead a deep World Cup run.

But some remain hesitant to say this group can pull it off. To this point, it lacks a true signature win and has come up short in recent competitions. In last summer’s Copa América, which the United States hosted, the USMNT failed to get out of the group stage after losses to Uruguay and Panama.

The result raised questions about whether this roster was talented enough to get over the hump.

“You can’t be a ‘Golden Generation’ until you do something that hasn’t been done before,” Davies told NBC News.

Edu said: “I felt like the ‘Golden Generation’ tag was coined based on the potential. And now some of these guys are coming into their prime, so that potential has to be realized. Everything, to me, now revolves around what happens next summer.”

To help them reach their potential, the program moved on from longtime coach Gregg Berhalter and replaced him with Mauricio Pochettino. His hiring was seen as a huge deal, as Pochettino, who is Argentine, has managed on some of the biggest stages of world soccer: Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

So far, the results have been mixed.

He has five wins and five losses in 10 games, but the team disappointed in March with two losses in the CONCACAF Nations League Finals. The team has also dropped four games in a row — including a 4-0 loss to Switzerland on Tuesday — though the lineups were far from full strength, with certain stars, like Pulisic, not playing.

U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said Pochettino’s “reputation stands for itself.” It’s far too early in the process to critique the job he’s done.

“We have a great generation of young players that we want to turn potential into performance, and we couldn’t have had and asked for a better coach to come in and have the ability to do that,” Crocker said. “Now, he just needs to have the time with the players and the games and the experiences to hopefully be ready for next summer, which is our objective.”

One year away from the biggest tournament in sports, the USMNT’s on-field product is still far from sorted.

The most important position to be decided may be goalkeeper.

Turner, who started in the 2022 World Cup, is once again expected to have that role. But after a year when he played sparingly as a backup for Crystal Palace, some wonder whether his lack of playing time will have him fit for next summer. Reports this week say Turner has agreed to join the French squad Lyon.

Nobody knows goalie play better than Meola, who said, “There are a lot of questions.”

“In general, we’ve gone into World Cups either knowing who our No. 1 is or two or three guys battling for the position. That’s been the rotation since 1990. This particular group, I think we’re unsettled in that position,” he said.

If Turner gets consistent action at Lyon, he should be that guy again in 2026. Patrick Schulte, Zack Steffen and Matt Freese are the likeliest next options.

Meola’s other position group to watch is center back. Out wide, Robinson and Dest are near locks, but the middle of the field is still anyone’s guess. Candidates include Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson or Cameron Carter-Vickers.

“There’s just too many question marks in the middle of the field at the moment,” Meola said. “If I’m going to focus on one, that would be it.”

Edu and Davies said they want to see how the next 12 months play out at center forward. The USMNT won a hard-fought battle with England to get Monaco’s Folarin Balogun (who has dual citizenship), but after him there are many names to consider in Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Damion Downs and Josh Sargent.

“Even if there’s question marks in other positions, if we feel good about the No. 9 position, I think that gives us a hell of a chance,” Edu said.

Conrad is similarly focused on the middle of the field, this time at center midfield. Pochettino could go with McKennie, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso, Tanner Tessman, Diego Luna or Malik Tillman.

He had one prediction that might shock fans.

“Gio Reyna ... I’ll throw him in there, but at this moment I don’t expect him to make the team. That’s my big shock,” Conrad said. “I’ll put my flag in the ground and say he’s got a lot of work to do to get into this team for 2026, which would probably be a surprise to many, but I just think there’s other players that are playing well and could fit the system a little bit better at this current moment.”

Even though questions abound in the middle, Conrad said he feels great outside.

“I would put our outside backs internationally against anybody,” he said. “Our strength, in terms of our starters, is Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest and then into Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah. I feel confident going up against any nation with our outside players.”

This summer, the USMNT has CONCACAF Gold Cup matches followed by friendlies in September, October and November. Players will then compete for their clubs, either in Major League Soccer or abroad, and then return for more friendlies before the World Cup.

The final roster, capped at 26 players, will be set 10 days before the tournament.

Nobody is more important in that decision than Crocker, the technical director. Previously with English club Southampton and the England national team, he’s focused on getting the best product possible on the field by next June.

He said questions around particular positions don’t really matter because nobody is truly locked in at this point.

“I don’t think that exists 12 months out from a World Cup,” he said. “You’re trying to build depth in the squad but also continue to monitor players’ performances. We need to know who the best three players are at every position. In the build-up to a major tournament, there will always be a player that hits form; there might be a player that gets an injury. So you’ve got to be ready.”

Twellman, a forward on the national team from 2002 to 2008, said his concerns aren’t based solely on the talent level in specific position groups. It comes down to results, and the team simply hasn’t gotten enough of them for him to be confident heading into a World Cup.

“There’s just a sense of apathy around the United States men’s program,” he said. “And I don’t think that’s a hot take.”

Crocker said he has heard some of the negative discourse around the program but “can’t control the outside noise.”

“Our job, both as staff and as players, is to almost sort of look within ourselves, to continue to work as hard as we possibly can, continue to try and improve in training every day to put the performances in that we need to every day,” he said. “We would love everybody to be great supporters and start to talk positively about the team, but we’d also know that we have a responsibility through our performances to control that narrative, as well.”",Sports
https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nhl/panthers-oilers-stanley-cup-final-rcna211997,"SUNRISE, Fla. — Taking advantage of the Edmonton Oilers' worst performance in several weeks, the defending Florida Panthers pounced on mistakes to win Game 3 in a 6-1 rout Monday night and take a 2-1 series lead.

Brad Marchand became the oldest player to score in each of the first three games of a final, while Sam Bennett added his NHL playoff-leading 14th goal after making a big hit on Edmonton's Vasily Podkolzin that contributed to the turnover to spring him on a breakaway. Marchand and Bennett have combined to score eight goals for Florida, which was dominant in just about every way.

""We ended up playing what Florida kind of wanted,"" said Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner, who got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots. ""They were great tonight.""

And it was not just Bennett and Marchand. Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart each got his first goal of the series, Aaron Ekblad scored to chase Skinner and Evan Rodrigues added the exclamation point in the waning minutes.

""We're a very deep team,"" Marchand said. ""That's one of our strengths is the depth of the group from the front end to the back end to the goaltending.""

At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky earned the ""Bobby! Bobby!"" chants from a fired up South Florida crowd. The two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender known as ""Bob"" was on his game for the very few quality chances the discombobulated Oilers mustered, making 32 saves.

""Nothing's going to be perfect in the way we play,"" Reinhart said. ""This time of year, you need some world-class goaltending and that's what we get consistently.""

Perry — at 40 the oldest player in the series — beat Bobrovsky with some silky hands for a power-play goal, keeping up this final being a showcase of cagey veterans along with Marchand.

Connor McDavid could not get his team on track, and Edmonton took 15 minors — led by Evander Kane's three plus a misconduct to add up to 85 penalty minutes — including a brawl that ensued with less than 10 minutes left. Trent Frederic and Darnell Nurse, who fought Jonah Gadjovich, got misconducts that knocked them out of a game with an outcome determined long before.

""Emotions in all these games are extremely high,' Marchand said. ""This is the time of year you want to be playing, and you're enjoying every minute.""

After the final looked as evenly matched as can be with Games 1 and 2 each needing extra time, overtime and then double OT, Game 3 was a lopsided mismatch. The Oilers came unglued to the point Jake Walman resorted to squirting water on Panthers players on their bench from his spot on the visiting side.

The teams have some extra time off before Game 4 on Thursday night, when the Panthers have the chance to take a 3-1 lead and move to the verge of going back to back.

""Game 4 is a really big game,"" McDavid said. ""It's a big swing game.""",Sports

https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/soccer/world-cup-looming-scientists-are-trying-create-perfect-grass-rcna210071,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — From thrilling goals to devastating knockout defeats, every four years the FIFA World Cup electrifies the globe.

And in one year, 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off with the United States, Canada and Mexico co-hosting an unprecedented event.

The tournament, which could feature the likes of superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, will mark the first time three countries co-host across 16 different cities, making for what FIFA sees as the most complex World Cup in history.

“Whether they’re playing Seattle or Guadalajara, I need these pitches to behave absolutely the same. I want the same bounce. I want the same volleyball action from the players into the grass,” said FIFA senior pitch management manager Alan Ferguson, who wants every team to play on a consistent surface, whether it's keeping cool in the Pacific Northwest, at altitude in Mexico City or sweating it out in Miami.

“The safety aspect is everything. It's paramount. That has to be my first thought,” Ferguson said in an interview at the facility at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where UT researchers, working with Michigan State University, have been helping FIFA finalize how each venue will prepare its pitch for tournament play.

“They need to have confidence if they turn right sharply, left sharply, they have to know that the ground is going to stay where it is,” he said.

That's not so simple when you're dealing with over a dozen venues that host the NFL to concerts to monster trucks.

U.S. venues are likely to face extra scrutiny after last summer’s Copa América tournament, in which pitch conditions drew public criticism from players such as Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who called the temporary grass field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta a ""disaster.""

“It’s definitely upped the stakes, there’s no doubt about that,"" Ferguson said about the fallout from last year's tournament featuring the 16 best teams from North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean.

""The research was already happening. What we were able to observe at Copa was more traditional, provisional for international soccer pitches. Because your stadiums are so busy here, they are a multi-event business plan, and they flip in and out from event to event. It’s not possible to put a traditional soccer field in there,” said Ferguson, adding that with the research leading up to this summer’s Club World Cup and next year’s marquee event, “I’m quietly confident we’re heading in the right direction.”

U.S. stadiums have been at the heart of the artificial turf-natural grass debate over safety for years. Next summer, all venues will use a natural grass-artificial stitching blend with a focus on what’s beneath the turf in addition to the playing surface itself.

In April, NBC News was granted exclusive access to the Knoxville facility where researchers led by Professor John Sorochan have been solving for that issue.

The team has studied artificial stitching, layering below the grass, root growth, grow light use and other details to ensure each pitch’s consistency, whether outdoors or inside.

Sorochan, a professor of turfgrass science and management, said the secret sauce will include Bermuda grass for the warm season venues and perennial rye mixed with Kentucky bluegrass for the cool season venues, as well as the indoor venues. There are also drainage layer recommendations for the indoor venues, which Sorochan said will also help with the pitches’ firmness.

“A lot of these in here are failures,” Sorochan said as he showed us around a grid filled with dozens of grass plots marked by a variety of variables. Some had stitched fibers, making the playing surface firmer. Some sat on top layers simulating what may already be inside a World Cup venue, such as aluminum concert flooring or artificial turf.

The team has a facility simulating an indoor stadium’s growing conditions. There’s even the fLEX machine, which tests the impact on a player’s ankle by pushing a soccer shoe into the turf. Seemingly, no piece of data is irrelevant.

“We can see how fast the ball comes in and out.

MORE — 2026 World Cup predictions | Who will start for USMNT?

What are the big storylines on the field exactly one year away from kickoff in Mexico City, and what can we look forward to next summer in the United States, Mexico and Canada?

Will Argentina become just third nation to win back-to-back World Cups?

Italy (1934, 1938) and Brazil (1958, 1962) are the only nations to ever do it and it hasn’t happened in over 60 years. What a way for Lionel Messi to (presumably) end his international career, which should reach the unthinkable 200-cap mark sometime in 2026, perhaps even during the World Cup (193 currently). La Albiceleste have not only already qualified, but they are the runaway winners of South American qualifying with a 10-point gap between themselves and everyone else, and just two games left to play. 2022 World Cup: check. 2024 Copa America: check. Can Messi and Co., make it three straight major tournaments a la Spain in 2008, 2010 and 2012? Only, Argentina’s treble would be slightly more impressive as Spain sandwiched a single World Cup between two European Championships.

Which host nation will make the deepest run?

At any given moment during the past year or two, the obvious answer would have been the USMNT and its so-called golden generation. But, uh, things have changed since the calendar flipped over to 2025. Back-to-back defeats, to Panama and Canada, in the Nations League semifinals and third-place game back in March, followed by the announcement that Christian Pulisic will be taking the summer off and excusing himself from the Gold Cup squad (also without Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna and Folarin Balogun), and the vibes are decidedly very bad for Mauricio Pochettino’s team. Meanwhile, Mexico are beginning to find their way under Javier Aguirre and Canada have the feel of a long-established club side under Jesse Marsch. Since Copa America last summer, the answer has gone from “definitely the USMNT,” to “let’s just see how the group-stage draw plays out.”

Lamine Yamal set for World Cup debut at 18 years old

The next Lionel Messi Lamine Yamal might already be the best player in the world right now and he doesn’t even turn 18 until July 13, meaning he will still be 18 when the 2026 World Cup kicks off and will turn 19 the day before the semifinals begin and six days before the final. With good injury luck throughout his career, Yamal could match Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo with six World Cup appearances by the time he turns 38 in 2046. If that doesn’t make you feel old, nothing will. Most 18-year-olds are equipped to lead the likes of Spain to World Cup glory, but then again most 16-year-olds are supposed to star for the EURO winners either, and here we are.

48 teams means more first-timers at the World Cup

With the field expanding to 48 teams next summer, a handful of nations are going to qualify for the first time and that’s what the World Cup is all about — sharing the game with the world, both new and old. So far, Uzbekistan (the White Wolves) and Jordan (the Chivalrous Ones) have clinched their World Cup debuts through Asian qualifying, and Oman could still join them. In South America, Venezuela have never qualified and are currently in position to reach the inter-confederation playoffs. Curacao, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Suriname are all through to the final round in CONCACAF thanks to the three host nations bypassing qualifying. New Caledonia reached the final in Oceania but were beaten by New Zealand and will head to the playoffs as well. In Africa, Cape Verde sit top of their group after having never entered qualifying prior to 2002. And all of that is before most of UEFA qualifying has even kicked off, with a staggering 16 places up for grabs.

How much will weather play a factor?

For anyone that has never spent a summer in the United States, let me tell you a little something: It’s typically really hot and humid, almost regardless of where you are. Six of the 16 stadiums have either fixed roofs or can close an open-air roof, and that covers 15 of the 32 knockout round games, but teams that don’t play many (or any) of their games in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Mexico City or Vancouver will be at a significant competitive disadvantage by the time the business end of the tournament rolls around.",World
https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/no-guarantees-that-oakmont-rough-will-cough-up-every-golf-ball-it-swallows?cid=nbcnews,"OAKMONT, Pa. – The U.S. Open is synonymous with tall, thick rough. Especially at Oakmont, where the juicy mix of Kentucky bluegrass, rye and poa annua will be kept around 5 inches and change, continually manicured so that it stays upright and keeps swallowing golf balls.

It feels worse.

“Try 9 inches,” said one competitor, only half jokingly.

Jackson Koivun, the standout Auburn junior who ascended to No. 1 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking on Wednesday, has already lost a ball to the rough, on the 10th hole Monday. He’s not the only one – Bryson DeChambeau and Preston Summerhays, in the same group, had drives disappear right of the 14th fairway – and if players haven’t, it’s almost a guarantee that they and their caddies have spent multiple minutes these past few days looking for errant shots.

“This is the worst rough that I’ve seen,” said Koivun’s caddie, Chris Williams, a former world No. 1 amateur in his own right and now the Tigers’ assistant.

The rough is thriving, in part, because of a record May for rainfall in Allegheny County. Slightly bigger fairways following a recent renovation by Gil Hanse have also emboldened the USGA to be more aggressive with the setup, which includes the elimination of the graduated rough that competitors saw the last time this championship came to Oakmont, nine years ago. When you spot mowers – several dozens of them, in sync – running about the property, there isn’t much cutting being done but rather what can better be described as fluffing.

“We just felt we needed the rough that we have,” said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s chief championships officer. “We think it’s appropriate for the driving corridors, and we’re looking forward to seeing how it unfolds.”

Of course, with this tenacious of rough comes greater responsibility to the spotters. Perhaps the most unsung of heroes this week will be the four to six skilled sets of eyes on each hole. That’s in addition to the dozen or so marshals per hole.

“This is like watching ketchup come out of a Heinz bottle, the anticipation,” said one marshal as he awaited tee shots on the par-4 17th hole during Wednesday’s practice round.

Added another, as she arrived for her shift: “I’m ready. I’ve got my sunglasses.”

They’ll be reinforced, too, as the dedicated spotters, not deployed for the practice days and 330 in total, will punch in beginning Thursday morning with the sole task of locating balls and flagging them.

“I’m glad we have spotters up there,” said Rory McIlroy, who also played Oakmont two Mondays ago in an outing, when there was absolutely no help looking for balls that missed the short grass. “… You hit a ball off the fairway and you were looking for a good couple of minutes just to find it.”

Added Ben An: “18-handicappers will not finish a round without volunteers.”

Try 13-handicappers, too. One such player who played Oakmont last month said he lost four balls in a hole and a half.

“And then I just walked in,” said the man, who is working as a spotter on the 18th hole Friday and Saturday.

One final-hole spotter for Sunday was already praying that they wouldn’t factor in the outcome: “Imagine if the leader misses one right and we can’t find it...”

Tiger Woods might have 16 major titles if not for his lost drive on his first hole of the 2003 Open Championship at Royal St. George’s. Woods and an army of marshals spent 5 minutes looking for his Nike ‘1’ golf ball that day but to no avail. Woods had to return to the tee and would eventually finish two shots behind winner Ben Curtis.

Bodenhamer seemed confident the USGA’s platoon of pupils would ensure that every ball is found this week.

“We have plenty of spotters,” Bodenhamer said, “but no guarantees we won’t lose a golf ball or two. But we’re going to do everything we possibly can not to do so. But we feel good about that.”

Now, finding balls and playing them are different stories. Most balls nestled deep in the rough will require hacking out with a lob wedge, with some of those shots requiring players to take their swings while barely being able to see the ball. Sometimes guys will get lucky, but it won’t be often.

Oakmont’s famous SWAT games usually produce a breakeven best-ball score of 69 to 70. It’s been at least seven shots higher in recent months as the club has prepared for this U.S. Open.

“I don’t think people understand how thick the rough is,” Collin Morikawa said. “It’s not wispy like the club is going to go through. … You have to be steep to get to the ball in the rough, and when you’re steep, it delofts the face, so you’re just hitting it deeper into the earth. It’s very, very hard.”

Added McIlroy: “The person with the most patience and the best attitude this week is the one that’s going to win.”

As we were hunting and pecking an item regarding the Chiefs’ looming requirement to pick and choose between a renovated Arrowhead Stadium or a new dome in Kansas, the Missouri legislature passed a bill that will pay half the cost of a $1.15 billion upgrade to the current home of the Chiefs.

Via the Kansas City Star, the Missouri House passed its version of a bill previously adopted by the Missouri Senate. The measure now goes to the desk of governor Mike Kehoe, who is expected to sign it.

The House voted to advance the bill, 90-58.

Said the Chiefs in response to the news: “We are grateful to Governor Mike Kehoe and the Missouri Legislature for taking this significant step forward. The passing of this legislation is an important piece of the overall effort. While there’s still work to be done, this legislation enables the Chiefs to continue exploring potential options to consider remaining in Missouri.”

That’s hardly a “thank you, we’ll take it!” from the Chiefs. Whether they’re inclined to try to use the Kansas opportunity to leverage a better deal in Missouri or whether they’ll use the Missouri situation to leverage a better deal in Kansas, it’s clear that the Chiefs haven’t made a final decision.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/gavin-newsom-locks-horns-trump-rcna211813,"Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.

The battle between the president and the governor of the country’s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump’s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts — in part through his new podcast — to cast himself in the role of conciliator.

Newsom delivered an address Tuesday night that aimed squarely at Trump and was clearly intended for a national audience.

""This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles,"" he said. ""When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commander the National Guard, he made that order apply to every state in this nation. This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.""

“For someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “This is unprecedented. There’s not a right answer. So far, he’s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.”

Newsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.

“The images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,"" he said.

“Trump always goes too far,” Bennett added. “Last time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation — those images really hurt Trump. Here, it’s a real question. It’s a much closer call this time. We just don’t know yet.”

As it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as ""Newscum"") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions — which have included deploying the U.S. Marines — as an overreach.

The White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. They included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.

On Monday, California sued Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.

Newsom has slammed the step as escalatory and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions” and that there was “currently no unmet need.”

Newsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.

""You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are — being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,"" Newsom said on X.

On Sunday, Newsom chided Trump ""border czar"" Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: ""Tom, arrest me. Let’s go.""

Late Monday, Newsom sat for a ""Pod Save America"" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and said some of those assigned to Los Angeles — in his view, unnecessarily — were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for ""this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.""

By Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.

""The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?""

On Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.

The White House had a different take.

“The President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,"" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. ""The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.”

At that, Newsom responded on X: ""Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.""

Since November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lie low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He has also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.

Trump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.

Now, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom — at least for the moment — and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.

Friends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.

That would be ""a Nelson Mandela moment"" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

At the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.

""He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,"" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. ""I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.""

Another observer had a different take: “This whole fiasco could make Gavin president,” Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump’s first term, wrote Monday on X.

The obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.

""The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. ""Good governance is always the best politics — to just show competence contrasting with Trump’s chaos.""

Trump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.

The relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters ""insurrectionists,"" declared the demonstrations a ""rebellion.""

The California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.

The powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state — as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.

Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.

Democrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops — especially without the consent of the governor.

""Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,"" McAuliffe said. ""This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.""

Bennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.

“This is a very, very dangerous thing,"" Bennett said. ""God forbid, if they hurt somebody … that’s real trouble for Trump. But [we’re] not rooting for that.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/china/china-us-trade-talks-rare-earth-minerals-electric-cars-defense-rcna211110,"As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.

China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world’s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.

That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China’s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a “handshake” from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.

“They were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,” Hassett said.

In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a “short-term bargaining chip” for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, “from being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.”

“Imposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,” the editorial said.

Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it “fully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.”",Science
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/military-deployment-l-puts-trumps-authority-use-troops-home-spotlight-rcna212064,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's move to send National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid unrest over his immigration policies has given new weight to a lingering question: How far can a president go in using the military to quell domestic disturbances?

For now, the military has a limited role in Los Angeles, at least on paper, focused on protecting federal buildings and activities. But that hasn't stopped California's Democratic leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, from vehemently objecting to Trump's actions.

Trump has not taken the more drastic step of invoking the Insurrection Act, the name given to a series of legal provisions that allows the president, in certain circumstances, to enlist the military to conduct civilian law enforcement activities.

But Elizabeth Goiten, an expert on national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted that the memorandum Trump issued Saturday authorizing military involvement in support of immigration enforcement makes no reference to Los Angeles, meaning it applies nationwide.

""That's just a red alert,"" she said. ""If we have the military being pre-emptively deployed throughout the country to effectively police protests, that is the hallmark of authoritarian rule.""

Although the military's role may initially be limited to a protective function, Goiten said that could easily be expanded in certain situations to include use of force and detention of protesters even without invoking the Insurrection Act. She pointed to the response of federal agencies under Trump during protests in Portland and Washington, D.C., in 2020.

Ilan Wurman, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said that to this point, Trump has acted within existing precedents that allow the president to use the military to assist with the enforcement of federal law.

“Federalizing the National Guard, using regular forces to restore order, is in my view well within the range of prior precedents,” he said.

But, Wurman added, any attempt to invoke the Insurrection Act “would be more problematic.”

When is it legal for the president to use the military to support law enforcement?

Generally, using the military to conduct broad law enforcement activities is forbidden under another law, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. But that statute contains many loopholes, of which the Insurrection Act is one.

The Posse Comitatus Act was enacted at the tail end of the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, erecting a new barrier against military intervention in the South as it moved toward the Jim Crow era.

The last time the Insurrection Act was invoked was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. President George H.W. Bush acted at the request of Tom Bradley, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, and Pete Wilson, the state's Republican governor. Previously, the act was used to desegregate schools in the 1950s and '60s amid opposition from state and local leaders in the South.

In calling in the National Guard, Trump invoked a different law that allows the president to do so when there is an invasion or a danger of invasion or a rebellion or a danger of rebellion or when ""the president is unable to with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.""

The law states that orders “shall be issued through the governors of the states,” which has not happened in this case, as Newsom is adamantly opposed to Trump’s move. California has filed a lawsuit that cites the skirting of Newsom’s role under that provision as well as broader claims that Trump is infringing on California’s sovereignty, among other things.

""There is no invasion. There is no rebellion,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday.

In a new court filing Tuesday, Bonta said there was a ""substantial likelihood"" that troops will ""engage in quintessential law enforcement activity"" in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act if a judge does not take immediate action.

He cited plans for National Guard members to provide support for immigration operations by, for example, securing perimeters in communities where enforcement activities are taking place.

NBC News has separately reported that Marines deployed to Los Angeles could be used to transport immigration officers to arrest locations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has said she fully backed Trump’s actions.

“We are going to enforce the law regardless of what they do,” she said, referring to Newsom in a Fox News interview Monday. “Look at it out there. It looks like a Third World country.”

Chris Mirasola, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said the impact of Trump's current plan could be limited by practical considerations, including the number of military personnel available and the cost of paying National Guard troops on active duty.

""This ends up becoming extremely expensive very quickly,"" he added. The cost of the Los Angeles deployment alone is about $134 million, a defense department official said Tuesday.

Military personnel are also likely to have little training in how to approach a domestic protest.

""This is not in their normal mission set. There's always risk of escalation,"" which would only be more pronounced if the Insurrection Act was used, Mirasola added.

How is the Insurrection Act different?

If the president invokes the Insurrection Act, troops would not be limited by law to protecting federal property and personnel. Instead, they could have a much more active role on the streets, with a greater possibility of encountering civilians.

While troops may not be able to carry out all the functions of federal law enforcement officers, such as conducting immigration raids, they could assist without violating the law, Mirasola said.

There are also questions about whether the judiciary would intervene if Trump sought to use the Insurrection Act — or even who would have legal standing to sue to stop Trump.

Litigation in that scenario could mirror a legal fight that has already played out over the Trump administration's efforts to use a wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to swiftly deport certain immigrants without affording them due process.

The Supreme Court said due process is required, that detainees be given a proper chance to raise legal objections before a federal judge. But the court also said such lawsuits must be brought via habeas corpus claims from the people affected, not under a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act.

Any attempt to use the Insurrection Act could be challenged, “but what shape the challenge takes may depend on the basis for invocation, how it is implemented and how it is directly carried out on the ground,” a civil rights lawyer said.

Although Trump and his allies have referred to protesters in Los Angeles as ""insurrectionists,"" there is no plan at the moment to invoke the Insurrection Act, a White House official told NBC News.

Speaking on Sunday about whether he would seek to use the law, Trump said there was not currently a reason to but did not rule it out in future.

“Depends on whether or not there’s an insurrection,"" he said.",World

https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/nba-star-shaolin-monk-victor-wembanyama-goes-china-retreat-rcna212247,"HONG KONG — On the basketball court, NBA star Victor Wembanyama plays forward-center, but in China it seems he has temporarily taken up the position of Shaolin monk.

The towering 7-foot-3 player from France has been touring around China and appears to have taken a spiritual detour at Shaolin Temple, according to a picture widely shared on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.

With a shaved head and wearing a gray robe, Wembanyama can be seen sitting in front of statues of Buddha in a picture posted Monday by the NBA’s official Weibo page, which said the player had “reportedly” begun a 10-day retreat at the temple in central Henan province.

“Deepening his spiritual journey!” the post read.

Wembanyama is in “closed-door martial arts training,” an employee at the Songshan Shaolin Scenic Area, which includes the temple, told NBC News on Wednesday.

“No one can see him. He deliberately stays out of public view,” said the employee, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Wembanyama’s team, the Texas-based San Antonio Spurs, posted a video on Instagram last week of Wembanyama exploring the Great Wall of China — while he still had his hair.

“@wemby exploring China!” the post said.

One of the user comments underneath said: “looks like a regular sized bridge when Wemby on it.”

The 2024-25 NBA season ended early for Wembanyama, 21, due to deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, for which he underwent surgery in March, not long after his first appearance in the NBA All-Star Game. At the time, he was averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.

The 2024 NBA Rookie of the Year and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft, Wembanyama entered the NBA as arguably the greatest basketball prospect since LeBron James in 2003.

Besides the Spurs posting his video, Wembanyama has kept his China trip rather low-key, not posting anything about it on his own social media accounts.

Retreats at Shaolin Temple have become increasingly popular in recent years with celebrities visiting China. Visits there usually combine meditation, kung fu martial arts and Zen Buddhist practices.

Seventeen officers were injured, bringing to 32 the number hurt since the violence began Monday following a large protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town.

Two 14-year-old boys appeared in court that day, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. The charges were read to the teenagers via a Romanian interpreter, the BBC reported. A lawyer told the court that the two teenagers denied the charge. They were remanded in custody until July 2.

Police are investigating attacks on properties Monday that saw four houses damaged by fire as racially-motivated “hate crimes.”

“The mindless violence witnessed over the past two nights in Ballymena is deeply concerning and utterly unacceptable,” Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said in a statement on Wednesday.

“Hate-fueled acts and mob rule do nothing but tear at the fabric of our society... This behavior must stop.”

One Romanian resident told the Irish Times on Tuesday that she was putting a British flag on her front window in a bid to prevent being targeted. Another door had a British and Filipino flag with a message saying “Filipino lives here,” a photograph in The Belfast Telegraph showed.

Five people were arrested on suspicion of riotous behavior in Ballymena, 28 miles from the capital, Belfast, following one arrest there on Monday, police said on Wednesday.

Police in Northern Ireland sporadically come under attack whenever tensions rise in parts of the British region, 27 years after a peace deal ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed there.

Officers in riot gear and driving armored vans responded on Tuesday with water cannon and non-lethal rounds, known as attenuated energy projectiles, after being attacked by petrol bombs, scaffolding and rocks that rioters gathered by knocking down nearby walls, a Reuters witness said.

One house was burned out and a police officer vomited after leaving another in a different part of the town that rioters had attempted to set alight, the witness added.

A number of cars were set on fire and one lay upside down in flames as police sirens blared throughout the town past midnight.

Separate protests Tuesday blocked off some roads in Belfast, another Reuters witness said.

Bins were set alight and bottles and masonry thrown at police following protests in the towns of Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus, police said. Police also reported some incidents in north Belfast.

The British government and local politicians condemned the violence.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/views-us-trump-dip-sharply-many-allied-countries-rcna211805,"Views of the U.S. and confidence in its leader to handle world affairs have taken a dive in more than a dozen countries over the last year, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday and conducted over the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term.

These declines are most pronounced among residents in neighboring Mexico and Canada, which have been at the center of high-profile spats with the administration, as well as a handful of NATO countries (like Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands) amid Russia's war with Ukraine.

Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.

Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his ""America First"" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.

Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.

Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.

In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.

And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.

On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.

Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump’s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.

When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.

Men, younger people and those who view their country's right-wing populist parties favorably are more likely to have more confidence in Trump.

For example, 51% of Japanese people ages 18 to 34 have confidence in Trump, according to the poll, while 31% of Japanese people 50 years or older say the same.

In the United Kingdom, 45% of men say they have confidence in Trump, compared with 28% of women.

Respondents across 13 nations registered a double-digit decline in confidence in the U.S. president on world affairs from 2024 to 2025. While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.

The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word ""arrogant"" described Trump well.

Majorities in 20 countries said he's ""a strong leader,"" while majorities in 21 countries called him ""dangerous.""

Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was ""honest,"" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him ""diplomatic.""

Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is ""dangerous"" in countries where Pew also tested Biden’s first year in office.

On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.

In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump’s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.

Majorities in three countries — Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) — have confidence in Trump to handle ""the conflict between Israel and its neighbors."" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.

Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.

On Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/may-inflation-2025-tariffs-trump-eat-rcna211826,"Inflation broadly held steady in May — and by some measures cooled unexpectedly — as price growth data so far showed few signs of President Donald Trump’s tariffs hitting the consumer economy.

The Consumer Price Index, which measures costs of business and services, rose to 2.4% in May from the same month a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday, up slightly from an annual rate of 2.3% in April. On a monthly basis, prices inched up just 0.1%, less than the 0.2% notched in April and below economists' forecasts of 0.3%.

The closely watched measure of ""core"" inflation, which strips out food and energy prices that tend to change more, also climbed by a slower 0.1% after rising 0.2% in April. Core inflation remained unchanged on an annual basis at 2.8%.

Surprise price declines in apparel, cars and furniture — categories seen as highly vulnerable to tariffs due to their heavy reliance on foreign suppliers — helped lead the index lower.

Some analysts cautioned that it remains too early to see broad-based evidence of tariffs driving up what consumers pay.

“Tariff-driven price increases may not feed through to the CPI data for a few more months yet, so it is far too premature to assume that the price shock will not materialize,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note to clients following Wednesday’s report. “We’ll likely need to wait until the late summer before the tariff impacts start to show through — either in the profit margin data or the inflation data.”

The surprisingly soft reading sent stock futures surging in pre-market trading as investors anticipated it could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. U.S. government borrowing rates also fell.

Vice President JD Vance cited the fresh CPI report to renew Trump's ongoing, unprecedented pressure campaign on the central bank — an institution traditionally meant to stand apart from politics — to lower interest rates.

""The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear: the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice,"" Vance wrote on X Wednesday morning.

The president’s on-again, off-again tariffs and trade-deal announcements have scrambled the spending plans of businesses and households. Surveys have shown weak consumer confidence since April, the month Trump rolled out his “Liberation Day” tariffs that reset baseline import duties to 10% but have been revised continuously since then. Just prior to the inflation report's release, Trump said China tariffs would be set at an all-in rate of 55%.

Trump campaigned on promises to bring immediate price relief to Americans, a vow that he and his allies have appeared to temper in recent months. But economists continue to expect his tariffs to raise prices, and some major companies have already signaled plans to pass at least some the costs of import taxes on to their customers.

Walmart said last month that shoppers would soon start seeing higher sticker prices. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reported Tuesday that a net 31% of its surveyed members planned price hikes last month, up from 28% in April.

“Walmart making their announcement that customers are going to start seeing higher prices really underscores how businesses are starting to feel this,” said Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at the consumer finance company Bankrate. “And if the largest businesses are saying this, smaller businesses are definitely feeling it, too — there’s no way around that fact.”

Walmart responded to Trump’s threats by saying it would “keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.”

Price hikes are showing up in other economic data. In May, U.S. factories registered the highest share of price-increase reports since November 2022, S&P Global, a data and business consultancy group, said last week. And firms quoted in the Institute of Supply Management’s latest manufacturing report noted the president’s tariffs have wreaked havoc on their ability to plan for the future.

If there has been any price relief, it is likely the result of an overall slowing economy, analysts say, with a weakening labor market forcing consumers to cut back on spending. Many consumers are paring back their travel plans to save money, for example, with recent Bank of America data showing spending rates below the levels seen before Trump returned to office.

Past experience suggests the coming months will more fully capture the impact from the tariffs. In a note to clients this week, Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts said it took a full three months before the price increases from Trump’s 2018 washing machine tariffs showed up in data — but that when they did, the pass-through was “rapid and complete.”

That suggests it would take until July for the tariffs — the bulk of which were announced in April — to begin to fully appear.

Even if the pace of price growth is no longer at the pace seen in 2022, when inflation rates reached levels not seen in decades, Bankrate’s Kates said consumers are still going to be left smarting.

“It’s going to be a persistent itch that doesn’t go away,” Kates predicted.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/howard-schultz-says-cartwheel-starbucks-ceo-niccol-coined-back-starbuc-rcna212423,"LAS VEGAS. — Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Wednesday that he “did a cartwheel” in his living room when current chief executive Brian Niccol first coined his “back to Starbucks” strategy.

The enthusiasm from the 71-year-old Starbucks chairman emeritus is a key stamp of approval for Niccol as he tries to lift the company’s slumping sales and restore the chain’s culture.

Schultz, who grew Starbucks from a small chain into a global coffee giant, made a surprise appearance at the company’s Leadership Experience in Las Vegas and cosigned Niccol’s plans. The three-day event has gathered more than 14,000 North American store leaders to hear from Starbucks management as the company embarks on a turnaround.

Niccol took the reins in September, joining the company after the board ousted Laxman Narasimhan, Schultz’s handpicked successor.

Schultz had returned in 2022 for his third stint as chief executive, but it was only an interim role. He previously told CNBC that he has no plans to come back again. Schultz no longer holds a formal role within the company, although CNBC has previously reported that he’s forever entitled to attend board meetings unless barred by the company’s directors.

During Niccol’s first week on the job, he outlined plans for the comeback in an open letter, making the commitment to get “back to Starbucks.” More details on how the chain planned to return to its roots followed in the ensuing months, from bringing back seating inside cafes to writing personalized messages on cups. Under Niccol’s leadership, the company’s marketing has shifted to focus on its coffee, rather than discounts and promotions.

When Starbucks announced Narasimhan’s firing and Niccol’s hiring, Schultz issued a statement of support, saying that the then-Chipotle CEO was the leader that the company needs. However, the Leadership Experience marks the first time that Niccol and Schultz have appeared publicly together.

During Narasimhan’s short tenure as CEO, Schultz did not mince words when the company’s performance fell short of his expectations. After a dismal quarterly earnings report, he weighed in publicly on LinkedIn, saying the company needs to improve its mobile order and pay experience and overhaul how it creates new drinks to focus on premium items that set it apart.

But Schultz said Starbucks’ problems went further than just operational issues and lackluster beverages and food.

“The culture was not understood. The culture wasn’t valued. The culture wasn’t being upheld,” he said on Wednesday.",Technology
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/us-born-asian-americans-no-longer-healthiest-group-older-adults-rcna212325,"For the first time in two decades, older Asian Americans are no longer the healthiest U.S.-born aging racial group with the lowest rates of disability, according to a study published last month in the Journals of Gerontology.

The report, which focused on adults ages 50 and older, used prevalence of disability as an indicator for overall health.

The paper shows that while disability rates have decreased among aging adults in every racial group, they have remained unchanged among U.S.-born Asian Americans. The findings suggest that one contributor to the stagnating disability rate is income inequality, which has affected Asian Americans more than any other group in recent years.

Previous research had found that both foreign-born and U.S.-born Asian older adults had lower mortality and disability rates than their counterparts in other racial groups. According to the new report, non-Hispanic white Americans have overtaken Asians Americans as the healthiest U.S.-born population, with the lowest disability prevalence.

“This study shows that the ‘model minority’ stereotype is wrong about the overall experience of U.S.-born older Asians in terms of health,” said lead author Leafia Ye, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Toronto.

The report is the first to focus solely on the health of U.S.-born Asians, a group that experts say has been understudied because of its limited population. The study drew on data from the American Community Survey, which has a sample size of more than 18 million U.S.-born adults ages 50 and older. The sample size for U.S.-born Asians is roughly 116,000, Ye said.

The study authors defined disability as any chronic physical or mental health condition that limits an older adult’s self-care or independent living capacity, which includes carrying out tasks like eating, bathing and shopping for groceries without assistance.

Two decades ago, just 5.5% of U.S.-born Asian elders had trouble living independently — compared with 7% of white and 14% of Black elders.

From 2005 to 2022, the report found, disability rates fell by at least 2% among U.S.-born non-Hispanic white, Black, Hispanic and Indigenous populations, as well as all foreign-born groups. (Black older adults experienced the largest drop, from 14% to 10%.) Among native-born older Asian Americans, however, the rate has stayed at 5.5%.

Ye said the trends preceded the Covid-19 pandemic, so it’s unlikely that rising anti-Asian racism was a key risk factor.

“What’s striking about this study is that U.S.-born Asians are the only group that hasn’t experienced improved outcomes,” said Mansha Mirza, principal investigator at Aging Services Inclusive of Asian American Networks, a national technical assistance and resource development center focused on Asian Americans older adults. Mirza wasn’t involved with the new study.

The trend could be attributed to the fact that U.S.-born Asians “are more assimilated into the American way of life,” Mirza said, while foreign-born Asians were more likely to “retain practices from their home countries related to nutrition and diet.”

Disability prevalence varies across the racial group. Cognitive disability is more prevalent in Vietnamese, Filipino and Japanese older adults, according to a paper last year in Innovation in Aging. On the other hand, Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino and Indian older adults have higher prevalences of self-care disability.

In the past, older Asian Americans have had better health outcomes than other groups because the large majority were foreign-born, Ye said. People with poorer health and lower socioeconomic status were less likely to resettle in another country, she said, so Asian immigrants became a “very positively selected” group that’s “healthier and more successful economically compared with both the source and the destination populations.”

By contrast, Ye said, U.S.-born Asians were immediately exposed to the country’s cultural and political realities. Socioeconomic status has a particularly strong influence on health outcomes, as college-educated older Asian Americans experienced a slight decline in disability, while those without degrees experienced an increase.

While the data didn’t include mental health measures, like loneliness and anxiety, Ye said it’s possible that those conditions could also have contributed to stagnating health outcomes.

“In a way,” Ye said, “U.S.-born Asians are both less selected and more exposed throughout their lifetime.”

Mirza said a point of further study could be desegregated research on the impact of migration history on health outcomes. First-generation Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees, for example, survived war, famine and genocide. Research has found that exposure to such adverse conditions could contribute to “altered diets and physiological capacity” in their U.S.-born children, who are now advancing in age, Mirza said.

Mirza also emphasized a need to study the impact of social isolation on Asian seniors, which she said is gradually emerging as a social determinant of health as much as smoking and alcohol use.

“We need to see what social isolation looks like for foreign-born Asians Americans and U.S.-born Asians Americans,” she said, “and the extent to which social ties are preserved within these groups.”",Science
https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/video-game-actors-strike-ends-sag-aftra-tentative-deal-reached-rcna177738,"The video game actors' strike was suspended Wednesday after a tentative deal with game publishers was announced, bringing an end to the union’s nearly yearlong walkout.

The previous Interactive Media Agreement between the actors and video game companies, which expired in July 2022, did not have any protections for artificial intelligence, according to the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), which counts 2,600 voice actors, stunt performers, motion capture and performance capture actors among its members.

The performers began striking last July.

Activision Productions, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts Productions, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Llama Productions, Take 2 Productions and WB Games were among the struck video game companies. The strike also applied to specific games on a case-by-case basis.

The future of generative AI — and how it can be used to replace labor — was a crucial sticking point for actors and writers during last year’s Hollywood strikes. While the actors and writers unions came to deals with studios in 2023, negotiations between video game actors and major game developers continued.

Terms of the new contract have not yet been announced.

In a news release about the tentative deal, SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland mentioned progress had been made regarding AI provisions.

""Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains,"" he said.

Crabtree-Ireland, who also was the chief negotiator, acknowledged ""the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike.""

SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher also commended the ""incredible courage and persistence"" of the video game performers, as well as “the tireless work of our negotiating committee"" in helping secure a deal.

A spokesperson for the union did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Wednesday.

The SAG-AFTRA National Board said it will meet in a special session Thursday to discuss the details of the deal. If approved, the agreement will be sent out for ratification, and the details will be made public.

Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers who were party to the Interactive Media Agreement, also praised the deal.

“This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union,"" she said in an email statement. ""It delivers historic wage increases of over 24% for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games.

""We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world.”

Many actors celebrated the news on social media.

Damon Alums, who voices the character Gustav in Spark Riders 3000, called the end of the strike “amazing news.”

“Ready to get back to work,” he wrote on X.

Cat Protano, who has voice acted in the games Genshin Impact and Avowed, expressed similar enthusiasm.

“WE’RE FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” she wrote on X.

https://www.nbcnews.com/world/china/life-size-labubu-doll-sells-170000-beijing-auction-global-frenzy-rcna212250,"HONG KONG — A life-size Labubu figure has been sold in China for more than $170,000, a record for the highly sought-after toothy monster toy boosted by celebrities.

The 4-foot-tall mint-green doll, whose price included a 15% commission, was traded in Beijing on Tuesday at what was billed as the world’s first auction dedicated to Labubu collectibles. Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.

The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in “blind boxes” by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.

The “intense” bidding showed the “growing momentum of pop art in the auction market,” Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions “regularly.”

The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall. Coming in third was a set from a series called “Three Wise Labubu” — one doll crossing its arms, one making a peekaboo gesture and one covering its mouth — that sold for more than $80,000, including commission.

The success of Labubu at auction reflects the “growing presence” of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.

“In a somewhat stagnant art auction market, this development is both stimulating and indicative,” he told NBC News via a messaging app.

Created in 2015 by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, Labubu is one of “The Monsters” in his children’s book series inspired by Nordic mythology. With high, pointed ears and serrated teeth, the small monster is “kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,” according to Pop Mart.

Labubu dolls are often sold in “blind boxes,” sealed packages whose contents are revealed only upon opening. In the U.S. store, one blind box from a recent collection retails for $27.99, while a set of six costs $167.94, though prices can more than double on resale sites such as eBay.

The dolls have also been popularized by celebrities such as Rihanna and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink, both of whom have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags.

Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Mart shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.

In the first three months of this year, Pop Mart’s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.

As Labubu’s popularity soars globally, Wang Ning, the founder of Pop Mart, became $8 billion richer from 2024 to 2025, a fivefold increase in his wealth, according to Forbes.

https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/trump-epa-power-plant-emissions-repeal-rcna212193,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will aim to eliminate existing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, a move that would curb the agency’s ability to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news conference that Biden-era carbon pollution standards for power plants “suffocate” the economy in order to protect the environment. Zeldin, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in January, stated that the agency’s announcement was a huge step forward in energy dominance for the U.S., while promising that no power plants would emit more than they already do. Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.

Zeldin also said the EPA plans to weaken Biden-era regulations on mercury emissions from power plants.

Environmental advocates say the EPA’s proposal is an escalation in the Trump administration’s ongoing push against climate action across federal agencies, including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy and the National Weather Service. In 2024, the Biden administration finalized the most stringent carbon pollution standards for power plants to date in an effort to tackle the climate crisis — but now, those rules face an uncertain future.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA Administrator under President Joe Biden, called Zeldin’s announcement a “political play” that defies “decades of science and policy review” in a statement on Wednesday.

“By giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,” McCarthy said.

Jill Tauber, the vice president of litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice, a nonprofit currently suing the Trump administration over several environmental rollbacks said: “Eliminating pollution standards from the largest industrial source of greenhouse gas pollution in the United States flies in the face of what the law requires, what the science tells us, and what we’re seeing every day.”

Power plants in the U.S. are a huge contributor to global carbon emissions. A report published by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law found that if the U.S. power sector were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world.

Under the first Trump administration, the EPA rolled back several Obama-era greenhouse gas standards on power plants, but this recent announcement marks the first time the agency has suggested outright repeals. Zeldin’s move on power plants follows his promise in March to tackle the “climate change religion” by reconsidering or repealing 31 regulations surrounding tailpipe emissions, coal ash regulations and oil and gas wastewater management.

The proposed rule, which will now move into its comment period, will face scrutiny from legal advocates and environmental nonprofits like Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which say the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by law — citing seminal cases like the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA lawsuit, which determined that greenhouse gases must be regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.

“We’ll be watching closely to see if the EPA proceeds with repealing these life-saving standards based on a legal theory that doesn’t pass the laugh test,” said Meredith Hawkins, the federal climate legal director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The NRDC stands ready to defend the public’s right to breathe in court if needed.”

Cutting historic limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants would impact global climate change, but it could also cause ripple effects on human health and the economy.

Harvey Reiter, an energy and utilities lawyer and a law professor at George Washington University, says that if the EPA moves forward with its planned repeals, he expects some energy companies and utilities that have retooled operations and made long-term investments in renewable energy to sue the Trump administration.

“The biggest impacts of the proposed rules are uncertainty and instability,” he said. “Nobody knows what to do next. It makes investment decisions harder. It makes decisions about hiring, staff and employees harder. It creates a lot of uncertainty in the market.”

Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants are not just a climate issue. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and fine particulate matter, which are linked to increased risk of respiratory issues and cardiovascular disease. Regulating carbon emissions from power plants broadly reduces other air pollution for communities living near power plants, said Laura Kate Bender, the vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.

“It works both ways. On the one hand, power plants burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change and cause health problems at the same time,” said Bender. “And then climate change, in many cases, contributes to extreme heat, or more wildfire smoke, or more ozone smogs. Climate change is a health emergency, and cutting carbon in the power sector is a critical tool in the toolbox for fighting climate change.”",Science
https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacex-axiom-ax-4-launch-rcna212108,"SpaceX has delayed the launch of four crew members on a privately funded mission to the International Space Station because of a fuel leak on its Falcon 9 rocket.

The flight, organized by the Houston-based company Axiom Space, was scheduled to lift off Wednesday morning from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but the journey into orbit was called off Tuesday evening.

A new targeted launch date was not announced. SpaceX said it needs time to repair a liquid oxygen leak that was detected during an inspection of the booster. Liquid oxygen is one of the propellants used to fuel the Falcon 9 rocket’s engines.

“Once complete — and pending Range availability — we will share a new launch date,” SpaceX said on X about the repair work.

When it does get underway, the mission is expected to last about two weeks at the International Space Station.

The flight, known as Ax-4, will be led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who has already logged a record 675 days in space — more than any other American astronaut. Joining her will be pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, an astronaut with the Indian Space Research Organization; mission specialist Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski, a Polish scientist with the European Space Agency; and mission specialist Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer from Hungary.

From left, Ax-4 crew members Tibor Kapu of Hungary, Indian Space Research Organization astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla, former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX

Shukla, Uznański-Wiśniewski and Kapu will make history by becoming the first people from their countries to live and work on the International Space Station.

During their two-week stay at the orbiting lab, the Ax-4 crew members will conduct a host of scientific experiments, according to NASA, including studies of muscle regeneration, how sprouts and edible microalgae grow in microgravity and how tiny aquatic organisms survive at the ISS.

The upcoming flight will be Axiom Space’s fourth crewed mission to the International Space Station. The company’s first private expedition to the ISS was in 2022 with an all-civilian crew.

The price tag for the Ax-4 mission has not been publicly disclosed, but space tourists reportedly paid around $55 million per seat on previous Axiom Space expeditions.",Science

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-workers-call-kennedy-resignation-protest-rcna212104,"Tuesday’s scheduled all-hands meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would have been the first during the new Trump administration. Instead, after it was canceled at the last minute, dozens of current and former employees at the country’s leading public health agency rallied outside CDC headquarters in Atlanta to protest what they described as a wave of unlawful firings, the dismantling of lifesaving programs and the censorship of science.

Amid the roar of cowbells and car horns, protesters held colorful signs with sharp messages, including “Save CDC,” “RFK’s War on Kids” and “Who the f--- is in charge?” The protest was spurred by staff cuts over the past several months that gutted departments amid a senior leadership vacuum at the agency, which still has no director. Many protesters called for the appointment of a new CDC director and the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the CDC.

“I am here today to tell you that the secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has shown himself to be a domestic health threat,” said Dr. Anna Yousaf, an infectious disease researcher at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

“These attacks against scientific standards and well-established processes culminated yesterday when Secretary Kennedy announced that he is firing all of the members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP,” Yousaf continued, eliciting “boos” from the crowd.

Kennedy announced Monday that he was removing all 17 members of the independent vaccine advisory panel. Months earlier, he oversaw a massive restructuring of federal health departments that included laying off 2,400 CDC employees and dismantling many agency programs.

Many CDC staff members had looked forward to Tuesday’s all-hands meeting as a place to air their concerns, but on Monday morning, Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC’s chief of staff and most senior acting leader, sent an email to senior CDC officials canceling the agencywide meeting.

While Buzzelli explained that the meeting was being rescheduled to review several in-process leadership updates, some CDC employees saw the move as another way to evade transparency. In a call to action distributed among current, fired and retired CDC employees, a group calling itself the Save CDC Campaign wrote that Buzzelli had “avoided our questions, dismissed our concerns, and ignored the collective grief we share for the agency, colleagues, and programs we have lost.”

HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon sent a statement saying that the protesters' “reactions only prove Secretary Kennedy is doing exactly what he was brought in to do: challenge the failed culture that has dominated public health for decades.”

A sense of rudderlessness inside the CDC has deepened in recent months, staff members said. The agency has been without a director since President Donald Trump returned to office.

“We need to know who is in charge of the CDC. We need to know who is making decisions,” said Kathleen Ethier, who directed the CDC’s Division of Adolescent and School Health until January.

CDC Director Mandy Cohen, a medical doctor, stepped down on Jan. 20 when Trump was inaugurated, as is customary. Shortly afterward, Susan Monarez, a microbiologist without a medical degree, was named acting director, awaiting the confirmation of Trump’s pick to lead the agency, Dr. Dave Weldon, a former congressman. Then, in March, Trump abruptly withdrew Weldon’s nomination, which Weldon attributed to renewed scrutiny of his past ties to anti-vaccine activists and discredited researchers.

By the end of that month, when Trump announced Monarez as his new nominee for director, roughly a third of the CDC’s senior managers had left their posts. Since then, Monarez has been absent from day-to-day operations, because of rules in the Vacancies Act that bar nominees from serving as acting directors of the agencies they’ve been tapped to lead.

Susan Monarez was nominated to lead the CDC but hasn't been confirmed by the Senate. CDC

It’s unclear when Monarez’s confirmation might proceed. Her nomination hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, chaired by Bill Cassidy R-La., hasn’t been scheduled — reportedly because she has yet to submit the required paperwork.

In her absence, Kennedy handed operational control to Buzzelli, a former federal prosecutor with no public health background. A Democratic lawmaker wrote that Buzzelli was “both unqualified and legally ineligible to act as Acting Director of the CDC in any capacity.”

A current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity without authorization to speak to the media, said the absence of a director leaves the agency without an important check and balance.

“The perception is that there is no buffer at CDC to protect it from what RFK Jr. wants to do,” the official said. “The center directors are trying to fill the void but are in the dark. It does not feel like there is any venue to express opinions about the agency. So the only outlet is protest.”

Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, defended Buzzelli’s role in a text message. “The CDC Chief of Staff has been carrying out some of the duties of the CDC Director as the Senior Official, as necessary, and is surrounded by highly qualified medical professionals and advisors to help fulfill these duties as appropriate,” he wrote.

Chief of Staff Matthew Buzzelli has been running the CDC in the absence of a director. CDC

Nixon said in April that Buzzelli would review vaccine recommendations made by ACIP, the group of independent advisers whom Kennedy fired Monday. But after ACIP’s April meeting, weeks passed and no recommendations were approved.

In May, Kennedy stepped in and signed off on three recommendations for Chikungunya vaccines for travelers and lab workers. But based on the CDC website, Kennedy has yet to approve two other ACIP recommendations — one for a meningococcal vaccine for certain teens and another for an RSV vaccine for high-risk adults in their 50s.

ACIP is composed of pediatricians, geriatricians and other vaccine experts who volunteer to meet three times a year to analyze the latest data on safety and efficacy of vaccines, including newly approved inoculations and new data about existing vaccines. The group offers recommendations to the CDC about vaccine approvals, and while the CDC isn’t required to follow the advice, it often does. The CDC’s decisions about vaccines play an important role in which shots are required to enter public school and are made available to children for free.

Kennedy, in firing the existing members, claimed they were plagued by conflicts of interest due to having received funding from pharmaceutical companies. ACIP members go through a rigorous vetting process before they are appointed and are required to disclose conflicts and recuse themselves from voting on those vaccines.

The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for June 25-27. Kennedy said on X Tuesday evening that he would appoint new members in ""the coming days"" and that they would ""highly credentialed physicians and scientists"" and not ""ideological anti-vaxxers."" Kennedy has faced criticism for his anti-vaccine activism, which includes founding the country's largest anti-vaccine nonprofit.

Former acting CDC Director Richard Besser, who is also the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a health-focused nonprofit organization, said he hopes the meeting won’t happen as planned.

“I don’t see getting 17 members to be vetted appropriately in that short a period of time,” Besser said.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/cdc-cuts-birth-control-women-chronic-diseases-sickle-cell-rcna211851,"WESTLAND, Mich. — For D’Asia Jackson, every day is a guessing game over whether excruciating pain will upend her life.

The 28-year-old medical assistant was born with sickle cell disease, an inherited condition that causes red blood cells to be shaped like a crescent moon. The anomaly can cause blood clots, organ damage and excruciating pain, which can worsen during the menstrual cycle.

“Pain-wise, I always describe it as like being hit by a Mack truck,” Jackson said. “When I know my period is coming, I know pain is probably right behind it.”

Over the last 10 years, Jackson has worked with her doctors to try a variety of contraception options to get her symptoms under control, from the Depo-Provera shot, a hormone injection given every three months, to an IUD to different forms of birth control pills.

According to Jackson, none of them helped. Some made her periods even worse.

“I might have a good four or five good days of not bleeding in a month,” she said. “Over the years, it’s like the period actually started getting heavier, and that’s when it started affecting my sickle cell.”

At times, she’s ended up in the hospital needing iron infusions due to loss of blood. Doctors don’t know how to manage her symptoms. Sickle cell has no cure and treatment options are variable.

“The lack of education on sickle cell is very frustrating,” she said. “I go into hospital stays having to educate doctors and nurses.”

Now, women like Jackson are worried that lack of knowledge, particularly about how contraception affects their conditions, could get worse.

In April, a small team that compiled information into what some consider the country’s “contraception bible,” a set of guidelines used by physicians to assess which types of birth control are safe for their patients, was fired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of mass layoffs from the agency. The eight-person team was responsible for evaluating research and recommending birth control methods for patients with various conditions, from sickle cell disease, kidney disease and lupus to those at risk for HIV.

The guidelines, called the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, provided the latest research for doctors, including an app that recommended which contraceptive methods were safe.

The app has been downloaded more than 440,000 times, according to the CDC.

Now, the work of that team has been halted as part of the reduction of the Women’s Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.

“These are the only federal guidelines that focus on the safety of contraception for women with certain medical conditions,” said Lee Warner, the former chief of the Women’s Health and Fertility Branch. “This work exists nowhere else, and these individuals specialize in this area. Without their presence, the work stops.”

Warner retired from the agency in April just after learning his team was being eliminated.

“While most women are able to use most methods, we looked at 60 conditions and over 1,800 evidence-based recommendations across an array of contraceptive methods,” he said. “For some women, it is very dangerous for them to become pregnant at a certain point. So having contraception available to them that they can choose can help protect them.”

At least 90% of people in the United States with sickle cell disease are Black. The maternal mortality rate for Black sickle cell patients has been found to be 26 times higher than for non-Black people.

“The CDC’s decision to cut the team responsible for contraceptive guidelines is especially troubling for the sickle cell community, where pregnancy can carry severe health risks,” said Teonna Woolford, who founded the nonprofit Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive to advocate for patients and expand knowledge about the often-misunderstood disease. “Eliminating this resource will disproportionately impact a community already facing significant barriers to care, further deepening health disparities.”

In response to a request for comment, an official for the Department of Health and Human Services did not explain why the team was cut.

In May, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended the cuts in a hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

“Right now we have 42 divisions that do maternal health,” Kennedy testified. “They’re not cuts. They’re consolidations. It’s ridiculous to have 42 divisions that are all supposed to be doing the same thing.”

Warner disagreed with Kennedy’s testimony.

“Especially with this branch,” he said, “the expertise is not redundant of that elsewhere in the federal government.”

“Once this expertise is gone, it is permanently gone from the agency. It is going to be very hard to resume and re-create,” he said.

Updates to the CDC's ""contraception bible"" found that combined hormonal contraception can be dangerous for women with sickle cell. Jackson was unaware of the new guidance until her interview with NBC News. NBC News

“The HHS restructuring consolidates maternal and child health programs into the new Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) to improve efficiency and better address public health needs,” an HHS official said in a statement to NBC News. “The reorganization aims to streamline operations, maximize resources, and support key priorities like maternal mental health and data collection. We remain committed to improving health outcomes for American families.”

Representatives for HHS did not specify if work on the contraception guidelines would continue. The Trump administration did not respond to questions about why the team was cut or if its work would continue.

The CDC’s most recent update to the contraception guidelines was published in August.

The updates included new recommendations for people with sickle cell disease, finding that combined hormonal contraception presents an “unacceptable health risk” due to patients’ risk of life-threatening blood clots. In previous versions of the guidelines, the CDC found the advantages of combined hormonal birth control, which contains estrogen and progestin, outweighed potential risks such as blood clots or stroke. The newest guidelines also increased the risk category for the Depo-Provera shot, while ranking methods like progestin-only pills and IUDs as generally safe.

Jackson was unaware of the updated guidance until her interview with NBC News.

She said she is using an IUD as well as combined hormonal contraception in the form of a pill to try to manage her bleeding.

“I didn’t know that,” she said. “I kind of just hope that my doctor knows a lot and kind of just steers me in the right direction.”

Warner said the CDC team should be publicizing the updated guidance now to make physicians aware of the changes and adjust how they treat patients.

“We actually planned to do a road show of the guidelines in the late fall and throughout the spring in which we would disseminate the guidelines and go speak to provider groups,” he said. “It’s not happening.”

The severe pain associated with her periods has driven Jackson to seek a hysterectomy for relief.

“I have been asking for a hysterectomy for years. I’ve seen five different OBs, and no one will do it,” she said.

While the current guidelines are still accessible, the August update could be the last, leaving Jackson with little hope that she’ll find a method of birth control that works for her.

“I am terrified of how health care is going to go with all of these cuts being made,” she said.",Science
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democratic-governors-roll-back-health-care-undocumented-immigrants-rcna211794,"A trio of states with Democratic governors viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates have taken steps in recent weeks to freeze or cut government-funded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.

Democratic Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Tim Walz of Minnesota have largely attributed the proposals to budget shortfalls stemming from original plans to expand health care to immigrants without legal status.

But the moves also occur against the backdrop of broader debate within the Democratic Party over how to handle immigration, an issue that dragged it down in the last election and that President Donald Trump and the GOP have continued to try to capitalize on.

The plans, which would scale back health care coverage for undocumented immigrants in the three Democratic-led states just years after it was expanded, have angered progressives and immigrant advocacy groups, who warn the party risks alienating its base — particularly as protests against Trump's deportation plans break out around the country.

The latest development came in Minnesota on Tuesday, after both chambers of the Legislature passed a bill to end state-funded health care for undocumented adults.

The bipartisan effort advanced through the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate as part of attempts to balance the state budget. It now goes to Walz, who has said he’ll sign it.

The bill would end undocumented adults’ eligibility for MinnesotaCare — the state-funded health insurance program for low-income residents — effectively reversing one of the signature policy wins Walz secured during a landmark legislative session in 2023, when Democrats were in full control of state government. Undocumented children would remain eligible to enroll in the program under the legislation.

In California, Newsom unveiled a budget plan last month that would cut back on health care benefits for undocumented immigrants — a stark reversal from his promises of universal health care for all the state's residents, regardless of their immigration status.

Newsom’s plan in his 2025-26 budget has called for freezing enrollment for undocumented adults to receive the full scope of the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Newsom’s office has said the changes would apply only to new applicants over age 19, that existing enrollees wouldn’t be kicked off their plans and that the freeze, which would begin next year, wouldn’t apply to people enrolled in limited plans.

Newsom’s proposed changes also included a new $100 monthly premium for adults 19 and older with “unsatisfactory immigration status” beginning in 2027.

His expansion of Medi-Cal has cost far more than his administration anticipated. Newsom has said the changes will help to balance the state’s budget, which has run a multibillion-dollar shortfall that he has blamed on Trump’s tariffs, as well as growing costs from higher enrollment in Medi-Cal.

Meanwhile, Illinois remains on track by the end of the month to end a program — called Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults — that provides state-funded health care coverage for more than 30,000 low-income adults who are living in the state without documentation.

Similarly, the program in Illinois was more expensive than expected when it was created in 2021. Pritzker’s latest budget, which the Democratic-led Legislature passed last month, proposed eliminating it by July 1.

At least four other states offer some type of health care coverage to adults, regardless of their immigration status. Several more offer health care coverage for children, regardless of their immigration status, as California, Illinois and Minnesota will continue to do if the new plans go into effect.

While the moves would help California, Illinois and Minnesota states recalibrate their budgets, a sweeping Trump-backed domestic policy bill moving through Congress proposes slashing Medicaid funding for states that provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants. Trump also signed an executive order this year targeting undocumented immigrants' access to government assistance programs.

In response to questions from NBC News, Newsom spokesperson Elana Ross reiterated his statement in his initial announcement of the changes last month that “instead of rolling back the program — meaning cutting people off for basic care — we’re capping it.”

Pritzker’s office said in an email that “this year, passing a balanced budget required the difficult decision that reflects the reality of Trump and Republicans tanking our national economy and attempting to strip away healthcare.”

A Walz spokesperson didn’t respond to questions about Minnesota's plan, which was the result of a compromise after Republican lawmakers had pushed to end the entire MinnesotaCare program.

“No one got everything they wanted,” Walz said last month after he reached a tentative deal with Republicans on the budget, which was finalized in a special session this week. “There were very difficult conversations about issues that were very dear to each of these caucuses. But at the end of the day, we were able to come to this agreement.”

Blowback from the left

Immigrant advocacy groups have panned the moves, saying they risk further imperiling the broader health care system, and blasted Democrats for succumbing to Trump's attacks.

“We urge state leaders to build on their progress, rather than placing the health of their residents at risk,” said Tanya Broder, the senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center. “Particularly as extremist politicians scapegoat and target immigrants, we are counting on state officials to do the right thing and hold the line.

“As states increasingly have recognized, a community’s health and well-being depend on ensuring that everyone has access to health care. Immigrants pay billions of dollars in federal, state and local taxes, yet many are excluded from critical health care programs,” she added. “Terminating state coverage for immigrants will compromise our collective health, as well as the health care infrastructure that serves all of us.”

Some progressives questioned whether the moves were part of a broader strategy by the three governors to move to the right on the broader issue of immigration, which polling has shown still remains one of Trump’s strongest issues.

They said they could face a backlash from their base by departing from positions on supporting immigrant communities and expanding health care.

“It really feeds into the conservative narrative that undocumented immigrants are a drain on our communities,” said Jennifer Driver, a senior director at the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive legislative policy group. “This assumption that by moving more to the middle or to the right that you’re going to recruit some people back — I think it’s a miscalculation.

“The frustration that you’re seeing in the Democratic base is due to this kind of this waffling, this kind of idea that ‘OK, yes, we are progressive — but only in some moments,’” Driver added.

Other strategists suggested it remained too early to gauge whether a broader shift was in play as governors and other lawmakers positioned themselves for potential 2028 White House bids, and they emphasized that the threats blue states face from Trump are serious.

“The Trump administration is squeezing the hell out of states,” said Jeff Blodgett, a Minnesota-based Democratic strategist who was a campaign manager for the late Sen. Paul Wellstone and the state director for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns. “There’s just a lot of concern about current and future budgets given what the federal government is doing to states.”",World

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for HHS directed NBC News to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

Rachel Cauley, a spokesperson for OMB, noted that the proposed budget would provide the same amount for 988 services as was provided in previous years.

“It does not, however, grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents,” Cauley said.

“Radical gender ideology” is a political term adopted by conservatives and President Donald Trump’s administration to describe the existence of transgender people and the trans rights movement, which it considers harmful to children.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has existed since 2005, and, in 2020, during his first term, Trump signed legislation designating 988 as the new lifeline number by 2022. That legislation required 988 to provide LGBTQ youth and young adults who call the line with access to “specially trained staff and partner organizations,” noting that queer and trans youth “are more than 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide than their peers, with 1 in 5 LGBTQ youth and more than 1 in 3 transgender youth reporting attempting suicide.”

A senior administration official said the money for services for LGBTQ young people has not been cut, but rather reallocated to the general 988 services so it doesn’t go to “radical grooming contractors,” using another term adopted by conservatives decades ago to falsely equate being LGBTQ or promoting LGBTQ inclusivity with sexually abusing children. The contractors who provide LGBTQ-specific services through 988 are mental health organizations based across the U.S. Most of them provide mental health care to the general population in addition to LGBTQ people.

The official said only the contract with “radical gender” counselors is being terminated, and not the resources. However, under the proposed budget, when LGBTQ youth and young adults under age 25 call 988, there will not be an option for them to be connected to a counselor who is trained to provide support to LGBTQ youth. Currently, LGBTQ young people can also text “PRIDE” to 988 to reach a counselor with such training.

The official did not respond to additional questions regarding what organization(s) “radical grooming contractors” was referring to specifically.

The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, is among the contractors that make up a subnetwork of specialists who provide 988 services to LGBTQ young people.

“Attempts to discredit these life-saving services will not change the reality of what this administration is proposing: the elimination of a national suicide prevention program, run by seven leading crisis contact centers, that has supported over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ youth across the U.S. with best-practice crisis care,” Jaymes Black, the project’s CEO, said in a statement to NBC News, referring to the number of contacts who have reached out to 988 for LGBTQ-specific support since the program’s start in 2022.

“Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — and our President — came together during the first Trump administration to create this specialized resource,” Black added. “It’s a shared acknowledgement that every young life is worth saving, and that risk, not identity, drives evidence-based and effective crisis intervention. We strongly urge the administration and Congress to rethink this proposal, and do what is best for ending the public health crisis of suicide among our nation’s youth.""

The other six contractors who provide 988 services to LGBTQ young people are Centerstone, Volunteers of America Western Washington State, Solari Crisis & Human Services, CommUnity Crisis Services, HopeLink Behavioral Health and La Frontera EMPACT. Centerstone did not answer NBC News’ question about the proposed elimination to 988’s LGBTQ-specific service, and the other organizations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In April, The Washington Post reported a leaked HHS budget draft that proposed cutting funding for 988 services for LGBTQ youth. At the time, the White House wouldn’t confirm the veracity of that draft or the information about the funding.

The budget proposal is the latest effort by the Trump administration to roll back services and protections for LGBTQ people, specifically transgender people. In the first few weeks of his second administration, Trump issued several executive orders targeting trans people, including declaring that there are only two unchangeable sexes, prohibiting trans people from enlisting and serving in the military, barring trans girls and women from competing on female sports teams in federally funded K-12 schools and colleges and barring federal funding from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors.

Federal officials have also scrubbed agency websites of any mention of transgender or intersex people, including from the website for the Stonewall National Monument commemorating the site of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, which historians say trans people were crucial in and became a turning point in the modern gay rights movement. At the start of June, which is LGBTQ Pride month, the Navy confirmed to NBC News that it would rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named for the LGBTQ rights activist, Navy veteran and first openly gay man elected to public office in California.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935,"The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.

Kennedy announced the change in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the “committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.”

Such a claim is ""deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process,"" said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world.""

""This is manufactured chaos,"" O'Leary said.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts — including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians — who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed.

The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations.

Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before they are appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist. The CDC released a database in March of some members’ previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry are relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.

“To claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,” said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution.

Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy’s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy. Kennedy, who rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since he aligned himself with President Donald Trump and became head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds to distribute vaccines to children of lower-income families.

In an interview, Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director, said: “Secretary Kennedy’s unprecedented action spreads confusion and casts doubt on transparent public health processes that protect Americans. I’m deeply concerned for families trying to navigate how to keep their loved ones safe.”

Kennedy’s decision to fire ACIP members “should erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,” Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday’s action will “make it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,” since they rely on ACIP’s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.

In his editorial, Kennedy called for a “clean sweep” of ACIP but did not say whom he planned to appoint to the vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said in a news release that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.

“What I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration’s agenda,” said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University’s School of Public Health.

Motta said firing ACIP members is “an unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise” that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in February that Kennedy had promised to maintain ACIP “without changes.” Cassidy said Monday on X that he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ensure ACIP is not “filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.”

The U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, including measles and whooping cough. Since last fall, 241 mostly unvaccinated children have died of flu-related illnesses, the most for a non-pandemic season since 2004.

Members of ACIP are appointed to four-year terms, and many were scheduled to serve on the committee for three more years. Kennedy wrote Monday that “without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.”

The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.

“The clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,” said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. “Insurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.”",World

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hoka-walking-shoes-review-rcna172789,"I’ve been reporting about sneakers for over five years, and during almost every conversation I have with podiatrists, shoe buyers and athletes, Hoka comes up. The brand only launched about 15 years ago, but it’s quickly become a household name. It offers highly cushioned shoes that can support your feet whether you’re running a marathon or standing all day, but what about while walking?

To answer that question, I coordinated three months of testing among the NBC Select staff, who wore different Hoka sneakers and reported their findings. Here’s everything we learned about the best Hoka walking shoes.

Methodology

Before our testing period, I interviewed two experts — Dr. Anne Sharkey, a podiatrist at the North Austin Foot and Ankle Institute, and Jewels Busenberg, a senior buyer at Zappos — about what makes Hoka’s shoes distinct, factors to pay attention to while wearing them and which models are typically the best for walking. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Zappos in this article was made independently of Busenberg.) With their guidance, I put together a list of five Hoka shoes for eight NBC Select staff members to test.

Hoka sent us the sneakers for free as courtesy samples, and two staff members tested each sneaker. Where possible, one person tested a women’s size and one person tested a men’s size for each shoe. We tested each Hoka sneaker for three months. We wore them indoors on treadmills and outdoors on pavement and trails for varying amounts of time.

How we tested Hoka walking shoes

While testing Hoka walking shoes, we considered the following factors:

Activity: We wore each sneaker while walking varying distances and for varying periods. We wore them for exercise and leisure, including commuting around New York City.

We wore each sneaker while walking varying distances and for varying periods. We wore them for exercise and leisure, including commuting around New York City. Arch support : There are two main categories that shoes fall into: cushioning shoes and stability shoes. Cushioning shoes are best for people with high arches because their feet need help absorbing shock, says Sharkey. On the other hand, stability shoes are best for people with flat feet because they’re designed with features that help prevent overpronation, she says. Some shoes fall between cushioning and stability — they’re typically best for those with neutral arches. We evaluated how well our sneakers aligned with our arch type and evaluated overall support.

Fit: We wore Hoka walking shoes in our typical sneaker sizes. During the testing period, we noted whether our shoes felt big, small or true to size. We also evaluated fit by making sure there was a thumbs width of space between the front of our shoe and our longest toe to account for potential swelling, especially at night, per Sharkey’s recommendation. Additionally, we noted whether any part of the shoes rubbed against our feet, and whether our heels slipped at all while walking, which should not happen with a properly fitted sneaker, says Busenberg.

The best Hoka walking shoes

All the Hoka walking shoes we tested and recommend below are available in men’s and women’s sizes, as well as standard and wide widths. Some earned the American Podiatric Medical Association’s Seal of Acceptance — I noted which ones.

Among other features, the Hoka’s website specifies each shoe’s stability and cushioning level, which I included below. Hoka breaks stability level into three categories, from least to most stabilizing: neutral, moderate and stable. It also breaks cushioning level into three categories, from the least/firmest to the most/softest: responsive, balanced and plush. I also listed each shoe’s heel drop, which is the difference in height between the heel and toe, and heel stack height, which is the amount of material between your heel and the ground. Heel stack height tends to be the thickest part of the shoe.

Best overall

If you’re looking for a Goldilocks walking shoe — meaning one that has just the right amount of everything — this is it. The Clifton 10 is a no-frills sneaker that reliably supports my neutral arches whether I'm exercising or commuting. Its overall construction is near-identical to its predecessor, the Clifton 9, which I've also tested. But the new model has a thicker, softer and more stable layer of plush cushioning, giving it a smoother feel on surfaces like trails and pavement.

I typically walk about five miles in these shoes each time I wear them. They have great traction, controlled bounce and a gentle rocker outsole that keeps me moving forward at whatever pace I set. The foam also sufficiently cushions my feet so they never feel tired, but it’s not so soft that I’m sinking into it. The sneakers fit true-to-size, in my experience, and they have a roomy toe box.

Best stability shoe

The Arahi 7s are designed with Hoka’s J-frame, which is a J-shaped piece of foam that wraps around the heel and lines the inner side. It helps prevent the ankle from tilting inward, also called overpronation. Nikki Brown, NBC Select SEO editor, struggles with overpronation because she has flat feet. And from the moment she put these Hokas on, she found them comfortable. “I have very, very flat feet that curve inward, and I love the high level of arch support in this sneaker,” she says. “They have a decent amount of stability and I felt grounded in them.” Brown wore her Arahi 7s while on long walks, commuting to work and running errands. She says they didn’t require a break-in period.

Mili Godio, NBC Select updates editor, also tested these Hokas while walking outdoors and indoors on a treadmill. She didn’t find them as comfortable as Brown because she has a higher arch, but appreciated their firm, supportive cushioning. “They’re very light without feeling flimsy,” says Godio. “I found myself seamlessly springing forward while walking.”

Because she has flat feet, Brown enjoyed wearing these Hokas, and says that they make her feel grounded. Courtesy Nikki Brown

Best for long distances

Similar to the Arahi 7, Hoka’s Gaviota 5 sneaker is a stability shoe, but it has more cushioning and is designed with the brand’s H-frame rather than its J-frame. According to the brand, an H-shaped piece of foam goes all the way around the sneaker and crosses through the center, which helps reduce overpronation while more holistically stabilizing the entire foot. That means the Gaviota 5 is beneficial for those with flat arches as well as those with neutral arches.

Lindsay Schneider, NBC Select commerce editor, prominently felt the foam around the edges of the shoe, which was sometimes uncomfortable for her ankles since she has higher arches. Still, she says the Gaviota 5s are objectively comfortable. “They’re really cushioned — you don’t feel every nook and cranny on the ground underneath you as you walk,” says Schneider. Bianca Alvarez, former NBC Select associate reporter, who has neutral arches, found the foam evenly distributed and supportive. “I wore these sneakers while walking around New York City and logged 18,634 steps in one day,” she says. “My feet weren’t aching at all and I never felt unstable.” Alvarez also says that while the Gaviota 5s aren’t super lightweight, they’re not heavy to the point where moving feels like a chore.

Alvarez says these Hokas never make her feel unstable and are lightweight. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez

Best for everyday wear

These sneakers are the most un-Hoka-like Hokas Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager, and I have ever worn. They’re not highly cushioned, don’t give you much of a lift and lack the cushy feel most people expect from the brand — and that’s exactly why we love them. “They feel like a firm mattress that’s supportive in all the right places,” says Rodriguez. “They’re very comfortable and never hurt my feet, especially after a long day of walking around in them.” The Transports’ toe box is also on the wider side and never bothered Rodriguez’s bunion.

The Hoka Transports are a lifestyle shoe, meaning they’re designed for everyday wear rather than exercise. I throw them on to walk around New York City leisurely or run errands. One of my favorite features is the sneakers’ elastic laces. Instead of tying them, you pull a toggle to tighten or loosen the shoe. However, the shoes come with standard laces, so you can swap out the elastic ones if you don’t like them. The Transports also have a 3D grip pattern that adds traction, which I found helpful while walking on trails.

Not having to tie the Hoka Transports’ laces is a big selling point for me. I can tighten or loosen them in seconds as needed. Courtesy Zoe Malin

Best max cushioning

The Bondi 9 is one of the most easy-to-identify Hoka sneakers due to its thick cushioning in the midsole, the brand’s signature feature. There’s also extra foam in the heel area, giving it a billowed shape that acts as a crash pad every time you take a step. It absorbs the majority of shock when your foot meets the ground so you don’t feel it elsewhere, which is ideal for those who have high arches. With all this foam, however, comes extra weight. “They’re somewhere in between light and heavy,” says Jordan Bowman, NBC Select commerce editor, who wore the sneakers to walk his dog multiple times daily. “But overall, they didn’t weigh me down at all.”

Since the Bondi 9s are so highly cushioned, they lift you off the ground by a few inches, which, at times, made Bowman tip his body forward. He also wasn’t always able to feel the road beneath him. That’s typically par for the course with a true max cushioning shoe, so if you’re interested in this one from Hoka, be prepared. “These shoes feel like a cloud, and I found them to be incredibly comfortable,” says Bowman. “They supported my feet, ankles and neutral arches well, too.”

Despite their thick cushioning layer, Bowan says these sneakers don’t weigh him down while walking. Courtesy Jordan Bowman

What’s so great about Hoka sneakers?

Since its inception, one factor has made Hoka’s sneakers distinct: a thick cushioned midsole. “Hoka created the max cushion trend,” says Busenberg. The brand’s shoes are designed with lightweight, highly responsive foam, meaning it compresses to soften landings and absorb shock, then bounces back to spring you forward whether you’re walking, running or standing for long periods of time, says Sharkey. And while the overall feel of the foam — be it firm, plush or somewhere in the middle— varies by shoe, the thick midsole is typically a guarantee.

Despite highly cushioned sneakers being trendy, some shoppers are on the fence. “There’s a view among some that the thicker the shoe, the more geriatric-looking it is,” says Sharkey. “Some people just find them clunky.” But once someone tries on a pair of Hokas and experiences their responsiveness, it can change their perspective. “People put on Hoka’s sneakers and they feel really good,” says Sharkey. “They stop caring what the shoes look like and grow willing to wear them due to the feel.”

Compared to brands like Brooks, Nike and New Balance, which have been around since 1914, 1964 and 1906, respectively, Hoka is a newer brand. It was founded in 2009, so it’s only about 15 years old. But in that short period, it’s become popular because it's attractive to so many communities. “Hoka is able to tap into all markets, from healthcare workers that are on their feet all day, to trendy celebrities, to elite long distance runners,” says Busenberg. The brand has even prompted its competitors to release their own shoes with thick cushioned midsoles, like Brooks with its Ghost Max and Glycerin Max sneakers, Saucony with its Hurricane 24 sneakers and Asics with its Gel-Nimbus 26, says Sharkey.

Two other factors make Hoka’s sneakers stand out: its MetaRocker technology and Active Foot Frame.

The MetaRocker is a curved outsole that rolls you forward to some degree and supports smooth, efficient heel-to-toe transitions, says Busenberg. “The brand increases and decreases the amount of MetaRocker in each shoe depending on the goal,” she says. “The faster the transition, the more “rocker” the shoe will have. On the contrary, if the shoe is meant to provide more stability and ground coverage, it will have a less curved MetaRocker.”

The Active Foot Frame hugs the perimeter of your foot to stabilize it. The frame in a more stabilizing shoe has higher walls, while the frame in a less stabilizing shoe has lower walls, according to the brand.

What’s the difference between Hoka walking shoes and running shoes?

On its website, Hoka labels what activity each shoe is best for, like an everyday run, a walk, a trail run or “lifestyle,” meaning casual wear. Some shoes are labeled best for walking and running — so can you walk in running shoes, and vice versa? “I would never tell someone to run in walking shoes, but you can walk in most running shoes, which means there’s more options available,” says Sharkey. “It’s important to run in running shoes, but there’s some flexibility when it comes to walking,” says Sharkey.

With that said, what are the main differences between walking and running shoes? Here’s what experts told me:

Running shoes tend to have a higher heel and a lower toe, which creates a pronounced rocker-shaped outsole and leads to a more energy-efficient stride, propelling you forward faster, says Sharkey. There’s also prominent cushioning in the heel and midfoot area. Most runners are heel strikers, meaning their heel hits the ground first, then their weight transitions to the forefoot, pushing them forward. Added cushioning helps with shock absorption, says Busenberg.

Added cushioning helps with shock absorption, says Busenberg. Walking shoes tend to have a wider base than running shoes to increase stability and support, says Busenberg. The toe box is also a bit bigger, which allows the toes to spread out more, and there’s often even cushioning throughout the shoe, says Sharkey.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796,"Although they are very rare, cancers of the appendix are on the rise, a new study finds.

An analysis of a National Cancer Institute database found that compared with older generations, rates of appendix cancer have tripled among Gen X and quadrupled among millennials, according to the report, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

“There is a disproportionate burden of appendix cancer among young individuals,” said the study’s lead author, Andreana Holowatyj, an assistant professor of hematology and oncology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center.

Holowatyj’s earlier research was “the first to show that 1 in every 3 appendix cancers is diagnosed among adults younger than age 50,” she said in a phone interview. “That’s compared to 1 in every 8 colorectal cancers diagnosed among adults younger than age 50.”

Still, appendix cancers are extremely rare: According to the National Cancer Institute, they occur at a rate of 1 to 2 per million people in the United States a year.

To see whether rates of the cancer had changed over time, Holowatyj turned to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, which includes data from nationally representative cancer registries that cover about 45.9% of the U.S. population.

Overall, there were 4,858 cases of appendix cancer from 1975 through 2019.

When the large proportion of patients diagnosed between ages 18 and 49 is combined with the new finding of a generational rise in Gen X and millennials, it’s “important that we find the causes underpinning these statistics in order to reverse this trend and reduce the disease burden,” Holowatyj said.

The new study further confirms that there is a trend toward younger and younger patients from recent generations being hit with gastrointestinal cancers, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a medical oncologist and a co-director of the Center for Early Onset Colorectal and GI Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

In particular, rates of colorectal cancer in younger adults have been rising for several decades. The cause for the rise in such GI cancers needs more research.

“It’s likely that there are environmental causes, which include exposures to food, water and micro plastics or lifestyle or dietary changes,” said Cercek, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “You can’t really pin it down to one thing or another. It’s likely multiple factors causing this rise after 1945.”

The appendix is a small pouch that hangs off the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. A blockage can lead to infection and inflammation, called appendicitis, which needs emergency treatment.

Unlike other cancers of the GI tract, appendix cancers aren’t easily found because they’re not as easy to see on abdominal scans and often won’t be picked up by colonoscopies, said Dr. Deborah Doroshow, an associate professor of medicine at the Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “So it’s not easy to detect or screen for them.”

In fact, Holowatyj said, about 95% of appendix cancers aren’t spotted until after a person has appendicitis and the appendix is removed and examined by pathologists. As a result, the cancers tend to be at a late stage with poorer long-term prognoses, she added.

Doroshow, who wasn’t involved with the new study, said it’s important for patients and their doctors to be more aware of subtle symptoms. Symptoms such as changes in energy level, a new persistent pain or unexplained weight loss in a young person shouldn’t be ignored, she said.

“If a person is feeling that something is not right it’s always best to get an opinion,” Doroshow said. “We’ve diagnosed young people with cancer whom other health care providers had not taken seriously because they were young.”

Women and people of color may find they need to advocate for themselves, she added.

He could give them the medication, called ivermectin, but only with a doctor’s note.

The callers aren’t in the throes of an active intestinal worm infestation, Murray said. They simply want access to the pills without having to see a doctor first.

“A lot of people are calling, asking, ‘Do you guys have it for sale? Can I buy it? How do I get it?’” said Murray, the director of operations for the independent Customedica Pharmacy. “Not so much, ‘How does it work? What is it for?’”

The volume of such calls has increased sharply since mid-April, when Idaho Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, signed a bill into law mandating that ivermectin be available to anyone who wants it over the counter.

While the law technically says that pharmacists like Murray can sell the drug over the counter, the Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved it to be used this way.

“I don’t feel that we could just sell prescription ivermectin,” Murray said. “It’s not designed or packaged for retail sale.”

That hasn’t stopped frenzied social media claims about ivermectin’s supposed “miraculous” abilities to cure everything from Covid to cancer.

“Ivermectin eliminated the cancer on the skin of my shoulder and it only took 3 weeks,” one person wrote on X. “It’s also working wonders on my eczema,” another wrote on the platform.

Ivermectin has never been formulated or labeled specifically for over-the-counter use, like aspirin or an antacid. Without proper guidance, there is concern that people could overdose on the medication.

Interest in using drugs or experimental treatments in unapproved ways has gained steam with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s appointment as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy recently said on a podcast that people should have access to controversial alternative therapies like stem cells and chelation therapy to remove heavy metals from the body. The FDA has warned that neither should be used without oversight from a doctor.

The hype has prompted lawmakers in 16 states, including Idaho, to propose and in some cases pass legislation to make the pills readily available for anyone without a prescription. While health insurance covers many prescription drugs, including ivermectin, it doesn’t cover over-the-counter medicines.

This year, two other GOP-led states — Arkansas and Tennessee — passed over-the-counter ivermectin laws.

NBC News called 15 independent pharmacies in those states, plus Idaho, to ask whether pharmacists could provide ivermectin without a prescription.

Not a single one said they’d sell the drug over the counter, despite the new laws.

All, however, appeared to be sympathetic to the request. One pharmacist in Arkansas took the time to explain that he needed to wait until the FDA provided guidance on over-the-counter ivermectin.

Until then, he and all the others said, over-the-counter access to ivermectin would have to wait.

Pharmacists say that just because over-the-counter ivermectin is written into law doesn’t mean it should be made available to anyone who asks for it. They still rely on federal health guidance.

“Most over-the-counter drugs, especially ones that were prescriptions at one point, go through some FDA approval process,” Murray said. “In that process, it gets decided what the labeling is going to say,” including warnings and directions.

Republican lawmakers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and West Virginia have also proposed bills to make ivermectin available over the counter.

Nearly all would simply permit health care providers and pharmacists to distribute ivermectin without a prescription.

Most, like the one proposed in Alabama, would also protect pharmacists from any possible disciplinary action such as fines or license suspension from pharmacy licensing boards for dispensing it.

Maine’s proposed legislation specifically permits ivermectin to be sold to people who want to try it for Covid, cancer or the flu.

Mississippi’s bill would limit over-the-counter ivermectin to anyone 18 and older.

The drug likely wouldn’t be placed on store shelves, but be kept behind pharmacy counters, much like some cold medicines.

Even if states do pass laws protecting pharmacists from disciplinary action, like the proposed legislation in Alabama, Murray said that he and his colleagues remain concerned.

“If you dispense something that doesn’t have directions or safety precautions on it, who’s ultimately liable if that causes harm?” Murray said. “I don’t know that I would want to assume that risk.”

The Food and Drug Administration warns that taking large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous” and cause vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, seizures, coma and even death. The drug could also interact with other medications like blood thinners, the FDA says.

A spokeswoman for CVS Health said that while its pharmacies are able to dispense ivermectin with a prescription, they are “not currently selling ivermectin over the counter” in any state.

Walgreens declined to comment.

What ivermectin is — and isn’t

Ivermectin was discovered by Japanese biochemist Satoshi Ōmura in the 1970s, first as a veterinary drug and then as a groundbreaking treatment for dangerous and disfiguring tropical diseases such as river blindness, as well as tapeworms, scabies and other worm-related infections. Hundreds of millions of people in mostly underdeveloped countries have used it safely with minimal side effects, such as fatigue or diarrhea, for decades.

During the pandemic, the true benefit of the drug got twisted and distorted amid a social media frenzy. When mainstream doctors and scientists insisted that ivermectin didn’t treat Covid, mostly conservative groups embraced it in direct opposition to public health officials.

Podcaster Joe Rogan told his tens of millions of followers that ivermectin worked to cure him of Covid in 2021, prompting many people to seek out the drug as a way to treat mild or moderate cases of the virus.

While there was early hope that ivermectin could ease Covid symptoms, it didn’t treat respiratory viruses. It still doesn’t.

Ivermectin has also been touted as a cancer cure. On the same podcast, actor Mel Gibson claimed ivermectin had wiped out Stage 4 cancer in three of his friends.

Gibson offered no proof. Some cancer patients believed the promises, with potentially devastating results.

“I tried that last year,” Scott Adams, the creator of the “Dilbert” comic strip, wrote on X, “to no effect.” Adams, a vocal Donald Trump supporter, revealed in May that he’d been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. “There are claims of it working, but I am aware of no patient who benefitted from it.”

Adams asked his social media followers to stop inundating him with advice to take ivermectin.

Adams wrote that his “odds of survival have probably jumped from zero to 30%” because he decided on a different treatment and will be “working with top doctors in the field.”

When one person pleaded with him in the comments not to discourage people from trying ivermectin, the cartoonist didn’t play around: “Your advice could kill people if they delay other treatments.”

There’s simply no evidence that ivermectin treats cancer, said Dr. Harold Burstein, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He knows because he’s looked for it, without success.

Since the Rogan podcast featuring Gibson aired, Burstein has had an uptick in patients asking him about ivermectin. He scoured the medical literature looking for any shred of indication that the drug could be useful to his patients.

“There are exactly zero published clinical trials in a human being on whether ivermectin does or doesn’t treat cancer,” Burstein said. “I can assure you that if any oncologist in America had seen” a benefit to ivermectin, he said, “they would have been eager to write it up.”

Some scientists are indeed trying to figure out whether ivermectin has any impact on cancer outcomes. Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have begun a preliminary study combining ivermectin with an immunotherapy drug for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Final results aren’t expected anytime soon.

Doctors tried to make ivermectin ‘work’

Ivermectin is manufactured in the U.S. by Merck. The company said in a statement that ivermectin should only be used within the approved FDA framework.

“The use of ivermectin is not supported beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information,” a Merck spokesperson wrote in an email.

Despite the growing push for over-the-counter ivermectin, there’s no sales data available for how many people are buying the pills.

Focusing on making ivermectin available without a doctor’s prescription is the latest in a trend of mostly conservative politicians sidestepping expert medical advice. Utah and Florida, for example, recently banned community water fluoridation, despite decades of widespread evidence that it drastically reduces tooth decay.

Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director of critical care services for South Shore University Hospital, part of Northwell Health in New York, said, “This is about constituents who either heard, read or saw something on social media and now have an idea that this is something good. They’re going right to their congressman or senator to demand access.”

“That’s not how medicine should work,” he said.

Scientists did, in fact, study whether ivermectin helped people with Covid.

Dr. Adrian Hernandez, a cardiologist with the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, led a large research project that ultimately showed ivermectin had no benefit in treating acute Covid.

“It’s always great that legislators care about the health of the state,” Hernandez said. “But ivermectin didn’t help patients get better any faster.”

Hernandez’s study was posted on a preprint server called medRxiv in 2022. Studies posted on the site are considered preliminary because they haven’t been peer-reviewed.

A second 2022 paper published by the New England Journal of Medicine found that Covid patients treated with ivermectin weren’t any less likely to be hospitalized than people who didn’t get the drug.

A third study that did suggest a benefit was later retracted because it contained fraudulent data, according to the publisher.

None of this stopped many from demanding access to the drug. During the pandemic, hospitals reported a spike in patients who had been poisoned after taking veterinary-grade ivermectin intended for livestock. Two deaths in New Mexico were linked to the drug.

Even the FDA warned that high doses of ivermectin can cause seizures, coma and death. “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it,” the FDA tweeted on Aug. 21, 2021. The controversial post was later deleted but can still be accessed through web archives.

A Merck spokesperson said the drug shouldn’t be used for anything other than clearing parasitic infestations.

Northwell Health’s Cassiere said medications, especially ivermectin, should only be used after talking with a qualified health care provider, no matter how politicians vote.

“If you’re not an expert, if you did not go to medical school, nurse practitioner school, physician assistant school, and don’t have the proper training, then you should not be recommending therapies outside of that expertise,” he said.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/celebrity-breast-cancer-announcements-highlight-rising-rates-young-wom-rcna211287,"Several young celebrities have announced breast cancer diagnoses in the past year — a public reminder that rates are rising among women under 50 in the U.S.

Pop singer Jessie J, 37, revealed last week on Instagram that she has early-stage breast cancer and plans to undergo surgery this month. Katie Thurston, former star of “The Bachelorette,” has documented her journey with Stage 4 breast cancer on social media after being diagnosed this year at age 34. And actor Danielle Fishel, known for her role on the ’90s sitcom “Boy Meets World,” revealed her diagnosis at age 43 to fans last summer.

New breast cancer diagnoses in young women have gone up considerably in the last decade. From 2012 to 2021 — the most recent decade of data — the rate increased 1.4% annually in women under 50, compared with 0.7% annually in women 50 and up.

The trend applies to all racial or ethnic groups, particularly Asian American and Pacific Islander women under 50, for whom diagnoses have risen nearly 50% since 2000. Black women have the highest rate of breast cancer before age 40 and are most likely to die of the disease.

Women under 40 generally aren’t advised to get mammograms unless they have a strong risk factor for breast cancer, such as a family history or genetic mutation. In that case, the American Cancer Society recommends mammograms starting at age 30, plus an annual breast MRI.

Several breast cancer doctors said younger patients and their clinicians should be careful not to dismiss symptoms such as a lump or nipple discharge.

“The thought was always, if you had a change in your breast but you were a young woman, it was probably nothing,” said Dr. Rani Bansal, an assistant professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. “As we’re seeing more and more younger women get diagnosed … we need to take these cases seriously.”

Dr. Oluwadamilola Fayanju, chief of breast surgery at Penn Medicine, said her youngest patient diagnosed with cancer was just 17. She recommended that young women with symptoms go to a center that’s experienced in breast imaging.

For women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, she said, “it may be better for you to be connected with a dedicated breast provider who can keep a close eye on you and do regular exams even well before 40.”

Breast cancer in young women is often more aggressive

As treatment options for breast cancer have improved, the overall mortality rate among younger women with the disease declined from 2010 to 2020, according to research presented in April at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Chicago.

But young women are still more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared with older women. One reason could be that they’re not getting screened as much, so it’s harder to catch cases early. Young women are also more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, which tends to spread fast and has fewer treatment options.

Dr. Virginia Borges, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, said all women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35 have a higher likelihood of the cancer spreading to the rest of their bodies, for reasons doctors don’t fully understand.

“It’s like this great big puzzle of all these different factors that can contribute to why we see these cancers behave the way they do,” Borges said.

Bansal said doctors are hoping to learn more about which treatments are better suited to women under 50.

“We need more data to better tailor our treatments towards younger women,” she said. “A lot of the studies that are done are in older women.”

Lifestyle, environment, hormones

There are several mysteries as to why younger women are diagnosed with breast cancer at higher rates. Doctors generally agree that multiple factors are at play, including lifestyle, hormones and environmental exposures.

Diets high in ultra-processed foods or a lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, which in turn elevates one’s cancer risk. Women in their 30s and 40s have also increased their alcohol consumption in recent decades, and drinking alcohol is linked to breast cancer.

Exposure to environmental toxins such as air pollution, forever chemicals or microplastics could also play a role.

“By the time women now in their 40s were babies, every single baby bottle had BPA. Everyone had Teflon pans in their home. Everyone was spraying Scotchgard around their home,” said Suzanne Price, CEO of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, a nonprofit that works to eliminate exposure to toxic chemicals.

Several researchers said more data is needed to definitively draw that link.

“Hopefully within the next few years, we should be having more insight into how those early life exposures drive the risk of breast cancer,” said Dr. Adetunji Toriola, a professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine.

Some studies have suggested that chemical hair straighteners, which are predominantly used by Black women, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Fayanju said the straighteners “can potentially have effects on our ability to process hormones in our body and how those hormones then interact with cells in our breasts, which have receptors for those hormones.”

Changes in women’s reproductive lives might have some effect as well.

Girls in the U.S. are starting their periods slightly earlier in life compared with decades ago. That may increase how long they’re exposed to higher levels of estrogen — a hormone that in some cases can feed cancer cells. A study last year found an increase in the number of women ages 20 to 49 diagnosed with breast cancer that was responsive to estrogen.

Many women are also delaying childbirth until their 30s and 40s, which increases the risk of postpartum breast cancer — cancers that occur within five to 10 years of giving birth that appear to be linked to changes in the breasts during that time. Borges estimated that there are 18,000 new cases of postpartum breast cancer each year.

“How do you get from the millions of women who are having children without ending up with one of these breast cancers to the 18,000 or so who are going to get one of these breast cancers?” she said. “We’re still working on figuring that out. Age is important.”",Entertainment
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/recall/cdc-fda-eggs-salmonella-recall-rcna211610,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to at least 1.7 million eggs, according to a news release issued on Saturday.

The brown cage-free and brown certified organic eggs were distributed by the August Egg Company from Feb. 3 through May 15 to retailers in nine states — California, Nevada, Washington, Arizona, Nebraska, New Mexico, Illinois, Indiana and Wyoming, per the FDA.

In an announcement issued Friday, the Hilmar, California-based distribution company recalled 1.7 million eggs, which have sell-by dates ranging from March 4 to June 19 and were sold at retailers including Walmart and Safeway, as well as under many different brands that can be seen here.

So far, the outbreak has sickened 79 people in New Jersey, Kentucky, Nebraska, Nevada, Arizona, Washington state and California, the CDC said. At least 21 people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Recalled eggs. FDA

“This outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses, and the true number of sick people is likely much higher than the number reported,” the CDC said. “This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella.”

Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can make people sick if they consume contaminated food and water, or touch animals, their fecal matter or the areas they live in, according to the CDC. It is “a leading cause of food-borne illness, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States and worldwide,” causing about 1.35 million infections in the U.S. every year.

Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps and can start six hours to six days after consumption of the bacteria. Children under five, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill as a result of contracting salmonella.

The CDC is advising anyone who has the recalled eggs in their home to throw them away or return them to the retailer that sold them. Businesses with recalled eggs should not sell or serve them, and should sanitize any item or surface that came into contact with the eggs.

The August Egg Company said it began taking its eggs to an “egg-breaking facility” to pasteurize them and kill pathogens after learning about the salmonella concern.

“August Egg Company’s internal food safety team also is conducting its own stringent review to identify what measures can be established to prevent this situation from recurring,” the company said in a statement. “We are committed to addressing this matter fully and to implementing all necessary corrective actions to ensure this does not happen again.”

This isn’t the only salmonella outbreak the U.S. is currently grappling with.

Last month, the FDA announced a recall of cucumbers grown by Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales due to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened 45 people and hospitalized 16 across 18 states.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/trumps-ban-stalls-surgeries-haitian-children-rcna211267,"Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump’s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.

The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.

The International Cardiac Alliance’s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.

“Some of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don’t go now, they’re going to pass away very quickly,” Robinson said.

The president’s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that “serve a United States national interest.” It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.

“We do have kids die every week waiting because there’s not a lot of international slots for these kids,” Robinson said.

Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States’ travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.

Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The “bad news” he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter’s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is “really disturbing and breaking my heart,” he said.

“I was not waiting to hear something like that,” Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. “We know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.”

He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don’t know “where they will find another open door that can give her a chance.”

Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn’t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.

Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children’s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne’s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.

St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.

Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence — including an attack on one of the hospital’s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death — ended most medical missions to Haiti.

Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti’s President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

“I hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],” Clark said. “But right now, there’s no way for us to go back down.”

Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.

On Thursday, Andrice’s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows “something can change at any time.”

Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti’s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent “everything that we had” and that their funds are “almost gone.” He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, “can have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.”

Clark, Robinson and the patient’s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration’s willingness to accommodate the sick children.

“These children are somebody’s child and somebody’s grandchild and they don’t have access to lifesaving care,” Clark said. “Is there any room for compassion?”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/recall/cucumber-recall-salmonella-outbreak-people-getting-sick-rcna210723,"A salmonella outbreak tore through the country last spring and summer, infecting more than 550 people and sending 155 to the hospital.

The likely culprit wasn’t raw eggs or undercooked chicken but an innocuous salad staple: cucumbers.

One year later, cucumbers are once again making people sick — and federal officials say that one of the same Florida farms is once again involved. Forty-five people in 18 states recently contracted salmonella in an outbreak linked to cucumbers from Bedner Growers in Palm Beach County, setting off a widespread recall that has affected everything from California rolls sold at Target to banh mi sandwiches served at a North Carolina high school.

The Food and Drug Administration has yet to explain how the cucumbers linked to the current outbreak became contaminated; the investigation is ongoing. But last year, the agency found that Bedner Growers had used untreated canal water for irrigation — and that the water was contaminated with one of the salmonella strains that had made people sick.

Cucumbers and other fresh produce may be a surprising source of salmonella, which can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, as well as more serious health problems that can turn fatal. Heat from cooking can kill the bacteria, but fruits and vegetables that are eaten raw, like cucumbers, can be unsafe once they are contaminated. That means it’s particularly important to protect fresh produce from pathogens lurking in water used for irrigation or washing.

For people who fall ill after eating fresh produce, the source of their sickness is often a shock — healthy foods that seem safe. “I wouldn’t expect a fruit or a vegetable to get me sick,” said Tara Chaffin of Midland, Michigan, who was infected with salmonella during last year’s outbreak. “I would never expect it.”

This year’s cucumber-related outbreak was only caught in April because the FDA was conducting a follow-up inspection of Bedner Growers and found salmonella that matched samples from people who were recently sick, the agency said.

“It’s disturbing when you see the same grower implicated two years in a row,” said Craig Hedberg, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. “It’s clear that this particular grower and potentially other growers in that region really need to take a look at where their water comes from and how they’re treating it before they’re using it.”

Bedner Growers, which defended its irrigation system last year, did not respond to requests for comment.

The back-to-back recalls of the same farm’s cucumbers highlight the potential threat of contaminated water, which food safety experts say is one of the most important and complex challenges in safely growing fresh produce.

A new FDA rule requiring farmers to conduct water safety assessments went into effect for large farms this spring. But already, some farming industry groups are concerned that the Trump administration’s budget cuts to food safety programs could mean less education and outreach to farmers about the new rule, making it less effective. And some food safety advocates warn that the requirements don’t go far enough, because farmers are allowed to decide how to respond to any hazards they identify.

“The rule really allows farmers to be regulating themselves,” said Anne Schechinger, Midwest director for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization.

The FDA did not respond to questions about the impact of agency cuts but said the new water rule would help improve public health.

The International Fresh Produce Association, which represents growers, has said the “vast majority” are already managing their water risks, and that the industry has already developed an effective system to quickly remove problematic products. “Continuous improvement is a part of industry’s safety culture,” Max Teplitski, the group’s chief science officer, said in a statement.

Fresh Start Produce Sales, which distributed the cucumbers linked to both the recent salmonella outbreaks, told NBC News that it is dropping Bedner Growers as a supplier.

“We require our suppliers to meet all U.S. food safety standards,” a spokesperson for Fresh Start Produce Sales said in a statement. “In light of this incident, we have no future plans to purchase cucumbers from the farm, and we are reviewing our supplier approval programs to help prevent future issues.”

Chaffin hated calling in sick from work. But in May 2024, she woke up with chills, diarrhea, a stomachache and a fever. She could barely move.

“It was the worst sick I’ve ever been in my life,” said Chaffin, 52, a manager at an ice rink in Bay City, Michigan.

Her doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong. She kept testing negative for Covid and the flu. Finally, one test came back positive: salmonella.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/rfk-jr-quickly-changing-us-health-agencies-rcna210505,"WASHINGTON — In just a few short months, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has begun to transform U.S. health policy: shrinking staff at health agencies, restructuring the focus of some regulators and researchers, changing Covid vaccine regulations and reshaping the mission of his department to focus more on alternative medicine.

The directives are all part of the same issue set that drove a slice of health-conscious, left-leaning Americans to eventually vote for a Republican president whose favorite meal is from McDonald’s, Trump and Kennedy catered to a type of voter who has grown distrustful of America’s health care establishment — but possibly fomented a new type of distrust in federal health policy along the way.

Bernadine Francis, a lifelong Democrat who backed Joe Biden for president in 2020 before supporting Donald Trump in 2024, told NBC News in an interview that she approves of Kennedy’s efforts so far, despite his “hands being tied” by entrenched forces in the administration and in Congress.

“From what I have seen so far with what RFK has been trying to do,” she said, “I am really, really proud of what he’s doing.”

Francis is among the voters who left the Democratic Party and voted for Trump because “nothing else mattered” apart from public health, which they — like Kennedy — felt was going in the wrong direction.

Concerns about chemicals in food and toxins in the environment, long championed by Democrats, has become a galvanizing issue to a key portion of Trump’s Republican Party, complete with an oversaturation of information that in some cases hasn’t been proven. It’s wrapped up, as well, in concerns about the Covid vaccine, which was accelerated under Trump, administered under Biden and weaponized by anti-vaccine activists like Kennedy amid lockdowns and firings in the wake of the devastating pandemic.

“We knew in order to get RFK in there so he can help with the situation that we have in the health industry, we knew we had to do this,” said Francis, a retired Washington, D.C., public school administrator, who said she left her “beloved” career because she had refused the vaccine.

“It seemed to me, as soon as [Biden] became president, the vaccine was mandated, and that was when I lost all hope in the Democrats,” Francis told NBC News, referring to vaccination mandates put in place by the Biden administration for a large portion of the federal workforce during the height of the pandemic. There are not currently any federal Covid vaccine mandates.

There have been 1,228,393 confirmed Covid deaths in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

How RFK Jr.’s picks are changing public health agencies

Dr. Marty Makary, Kennedy’s hand-picked commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a John Hopkins scientist and researcher, told NBC News in an interview that he wants to transform the agency, which he said faced “corruption” over influence from the pharmaceutical and food industries.

“I mean, you look at the food pyramid, it was not based on what’s best for you, it was based on what companies wanted you to buy,” he said, referring to the 1992 and later iterations of official government nutritional guidance. He said there would be “entirely new nutrition guidance” released later this year, as soon as this summer.

He praised the FDA’s mission of research and regulation, saying the agency is “incredibly well-oiled, and we’ve got the trains running on time.”

He also highlighted the 75-page “Make America Healthy Again” commission report — which focused on ultraprocessed foods and toxins in the environment — as having set “the agenda for research” at the FDA, HHS and agencies overseeing social safety net programs such as Medicare and food stamps moving forward. (The MAHA report initially cited some studies that didn’t exist, a mistake that Kennedy adviser Calley Means said was a “great disservice” to their mission.)

“I think there’s a lot we’re going to learn. For example, the microbiome, which gets attention in the MAHA report, needs to be on the map. We don’t even talk about it in our medical circles,” Makary said. “The microbiome, food is medicine, the immune response that happens when chemicals that don’t appear in nature go down our GI tract.”

Pressed on other areas of the administration, like the Environmental Protection Agency, making decisions that run counter to the pro-regulatory ideas presented in the MAHA report, Makary said he can “only comment on the FDA” where they are “committed to Secretary Kennedy’s vision.”

But Kennedy’s public health agenda goes beyond looking at the food supply and chemicals. Recently, Kennedy said in a video posted on X last month that the Covid vaccine is no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a change in CDC guidance that skipped the normal public review period.

Days later, after critics questioned the decision and raised concerns over a lack of public data behind the move, the administration updated its guidance again, urging parents to consult with their doctors instead.

Pressed about the confusion and whether Americans are now trading one side of public distrust in the health system for another, Makary defended Kennedy, who has been criticized for spreading misinformation.

“My experience with Secretary Robert F. Kennedy is that he listens. He listens to myself, he listens to Jay Bhattacharya, listens to Dr. Mehmet Oz, he listens to a host of scientists that are giving him guidance,” Makary argued, referring to the director of the National Institutes of Health and the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, respectively. “So he may have big questions, but the questions he’s asking are the questions most Americans are asking.”

The intersection of medicine and healthy lifestyle choices

Dr. Dawn Mussallem, a breast cancer oncologist and integrative medicine doctor — a physician who combines conventional treatments with research-based alternative therapies — has tried to help her patients wade through medical misinformation they encounter online and in their social circles.

Mussallem has an incredible story of personal survival: While in medical school, she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer and, after conventional therapies like chemo saved her life, was diagnosed with heart failure. After undergoing a heart transplant, Mussallem ran a 26-mile marathon just one year later.

“I learned a lot in medical school, but nothing compared to what I learned being a patient,” said Mussallem, who dedicates, on average, 90 minutes each in one-on-one sessions with her patients. “This is not about any one political choice. But we know lifestyle matters.”

For example, a new study from the American Society of Clinical Oncology finds eating food that lowers inflammation in the body may help people with advanced colon cancer survive longer.

Mussallem’s mission, along with her colleagues, is to elevate the modern medicine that saved her life, as well as encouraging her patients to live healthy lifestyles, including regular exercise, minimally processed foods, less screen time, more social connection and better sleep.

But politics do get in the way for millions of Americans who are inundated daily with social media influencers and “nonmedical experts,” as Mussallem puts it, who stoke fear in her patients.

“Patients come in with all these questions, fears,” she said. “I’ve heard this many times from patients, that their nervous system is affected by what they’re seeing happening in government.”

Mussallem acknowledges that “a lot of individuals out there” have questioned traditional medicine. For her, it isn’t one or the other — it’s both.

“We have to trust the conventional medicine,” she said. “With the conventional care that marches right alongside more of an integrative modality to look at the root causes of disease, as well as to help to optimize with lifestyle, is where we need to be.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-surgeon-general-pick-criticizes-others-conflicts-profits-wellne-rcna211420,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.

Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.

A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.

In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.

Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.

Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.

“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.

The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.

Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.

The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.

Means’ use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.

A compelling origin story

Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.

“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.

Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.

Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.

“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly’s podcast last year.

But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.

During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.

Growing an audience, and selling products

Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”

With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.

Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.

“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.

Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.

Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy”; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.

She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”

On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”

It’s not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.

Disclosing conflicts

Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”

“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,” Means said. “We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”

In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”

On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”

Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.

Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.

Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.

Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.

Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil’s founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means’ business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means’ advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi’s prediabetes and other ailments.

“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.

While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.

“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”

Potential conflicts pose new ethical questions

Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.

Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.

He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.

Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.

Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.

“This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/taurine-longevity-supplement-healthy-aging-study-rcna210604,"Scientists have long been trying to discover whether the popular supplement taurine can slow aging.

Evidence had suggested that levels of the nutrient found in meat and shellfish declined after midlife in people, meaning that taurine might be considered a marker for healthy aging. A 2023 international study confirmed that taurine decreased with age and then showed that taurine supplements could slow the aging process in several species of animals.

Now, a new study published in Science on Thursday found that taurine levels did not decline with age but, rather, were unchanged throughout adult life or even increased in some older people.

The seeming contradiction suggests that taurine measurements wouldn’t be an indicator for longevity and raises questions about its use as an anti-aging supplement. After expecting to find that higher taurine levels in the blood protected against inflammation or some chronic diseases, the finding surprised even the authors of the new study.

“We did this study to confirm what the first had done,” co-author Dr. Luigi Ferrucci, scientific director at National Institute on Aging, said in a press briefing. “Our purpose was really not to find the exact same association, but to find a strengthening.”

When their study was finished, “there was a large discrepancy,” he said. “This discrepancy needs to be analyzed more in depth because that may reveal some important mechanism with aging.”

The new findings do not rule out the possibility that boosting taurine with supplements might improve health in some people.

Vijay Yadav, co-author of the earlier study and head of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Healthy Longevity Program, said the new data will be important to the understanding of how taurine affects the aging process because it shows that it matters where the underlying data was collected.

One of the biological databases that was analyzed for his study came from a very homogeneous group of people from Finland, whereas one of the major sources of data for the new study was residents of Baltimore where the population is very varied genetically, he said.

“This would suggest to me that different genetic backgrounds or populations have different taurine values and data from different races or ethnicities cannot be pooled to interpret results,” he said. “It just means we need to better define the variables, genetic background is certainly an important one.” Others could include whether an individual has fasted or recently eaten.

It may turn out to be similar to the situation when scientists were trying to understand the relationship between blood sugar and diabetes, Yadav said. Initially, for example, it wasn’t known that it made a difference if samples were collected from someone who was fasting or had already consumed a meal.

The human body can make small amounts of taurine, although people mostly get it from food. Shellfish, dark chicken and turkey meat contain the highest levels of taurine. Other meats have moderate amounts of taurine. Dairy products have small amounts of the amino acid.

To shed light on whether a taurine supplement improves health and delays biological aging, Yadav and his colleagues are currently running a double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial.

The two papers are a good example of how science can work, said Dr. Peter Abadir, a specialist in geriatrics and an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Although the findings are very different, “that doesn’t mean one is right and one is wrong,” he added.

“The message from both these papers is we need more studies,” said Abadir, who was not involved with either.",Science
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/planned-parenthood-provides-basic-health-care-clinics-close-will-many-rcna210757,"When the Trump administration suddenly froze federal funding to more than 100 Planned Parenthood clinics this spring, the organization’s Michigan branch was already deep into hard discussions about its finances.

“The leadership team and our board had been scenario planning for months to try to fill those gaps to see how we could continue providing care,” said Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.

The only option was clear. Michigan’s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state’s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, the city’s two clinics would be combined.

It’s a reality playing out across the country.

At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers –– low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.

Uniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.

“What is different this time around is that it’s much more sweeping. It’s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,” said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.

In March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.

Federal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother’s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.

But if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.

If the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.

Over half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood’s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.

Phenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can’t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.

“They know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,” she said.

Before the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.

“The numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,” Phenicie said.

Clinics provide basic health care

At least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.

Abortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.

The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.

More than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.

Those important medical services haven’t swayed opponents of the clinics.

In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.

“My commitment to protecting life isn’t just personal, it’s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I’ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,” Paul said in a press release.

Closing in states that support abortion rights

About 40% of Planned Parenthood’s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can’t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.

“Cutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,” NYU’s Kapadia said.

Wendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, “the reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.

“The U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,” Stark said. “We are sitting in a micro version of that.”

Earlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.

In late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.

Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.

“We are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,” Stark said. “We also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.”

The decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood’s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.

“When we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?” Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.

“If we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,” she said.

Straining a fragile health care system

Several state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.

Robin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women’s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.

“We exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,” she said.

Planned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.

There are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.

“There aren’t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,” she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.

WAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.

“Every time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that’s the only way my patients can get care,” she said. Other than grants, “we rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.”

Marty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.

“You are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can’t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,” Kapadia said.

The GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.

If the “Big Beautiful Bill” passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.

When Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.

Although there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.

In the month leading up to this year’s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.

“Even if they would like to continue care, if they can’t be covered under Title X and they can’t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,” Phenicie said.

The decision by Western governments friendly to Israel was a sharp rebuke of Israel’s settlement policies in the West Bank and of settler violence, which has spiked since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.

National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, key partners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, are champions of Israeli settlement who support continuing the war in Gaza, facilitating what they call the voluntary emigration of its Palestinian population and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.

They could now face asset freezes and travel bans.

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the five countries said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich “have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.”

U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the two men “have been inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months” and “encouraging egregious abuses of human rights.”

“These measures are directed at individuals who directly contribute to extremist settler violence,” said Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. “The measures are not directed against the state of Israel itself.”

New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wednesday that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir “have severely and deliberately undermined” prospects for peace and security while “inciting violence and forced displacement.”

“Our action today is not against the Israeli people, who suffered immeasurably on October 7 and who have continued to suffer through Hamas’ ongoing refusal to release all hostages,” Peters said in a statement. “Nor is it designed to sanction the wider Israeli government.”

Smotrich wrote on social media that he learned of the sanctions while he was inaugurating a new West Bank settlement. “We are determined to continue building,” he said.

Ben-Gvir, also writing on social media, said “we overcame Pharoah, we’ll overcome Starmer’s Wall,” referring to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. condemned the sanctions and urged their reversal.

“We reject any notion of equivalence: Hamas is a terrorist organization that committed unspeakable atrocities, continues to hold innocent civilians hostage, and prevents the people of Gaza from living in peace,” he said in a post on X. “We remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.”

Israel’s government also condemned the announcement, which came as traditional allies of Israel escalate denouncements of Israel’s actions in Gaza, from the high civilian death toll to a monthslong blockade that led to famine warnings.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the sanctions decision “outrageous.” He said he had discussed it with Netanyahu and that they would meet next week to discuss Israel’s response.

He said the move threatened to harden Hamas’ stance in ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza and to cut short Israel’s operation in Gaza before it achieves its goals.

Benny Gantz, a centrist Israeli lawmaker and political rival to Netanyahu, wrote that he “vehemently” disagreed with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, but said the move was a “profound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists around the world.”

Netanyahu is the target of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year over alleged war crimes in Gaza, part of a global wave of outrage at Israel’s conduct during its 20-month war against Hamas. Netanyahu has denied the allegations and accused the court of being biased against Israel.

The Biden administration took the rare step of sanctioning radical Israeli settlers implicated in violence in the occupied West Bank — sanctions that were lifted by President Donald Trump.

Eitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer who spent years campaigning for the sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir — along with violent West Bank settlers — described Tuesday’s move as “historic.”

“It means the wall of immunity that Israeli politicians had has been broken,” he said. “It’s unbelievable that it took so long for Western governments to sanction Israeli politicians, and the fact that it’s being done while Trump is president is quite amazing.”

Mack added: “It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.”

Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.

Successive Israeli governments have promoted settlement growth and construction stretching back decades. It has exploded under Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts.

There are now well over 100 settlements across the West Bank that house more than 500,000 settlers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the territory’s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers.

Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal, and Palestinians see them as the greatest obstacle to an eventual two-state solution, which is still seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/greta-thunberg-deported-israel-military-intercepts-gaza-bound-aid-boat-rcna211976,"Greta Thunberg was deported from Israel on Tuesday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, the day after she and other activists were detained while trying to deliver a symbolic shipment of aid to Gaza by sea.

In a post on X, the ministry said that Thunberg, 22, had “just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden” via France, and shared images of her on a plane.

That came after the ministry said in a statement that a number of people detained by Israel aboard the intercepted British-flagged yacht Madleen had arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport to “return to their home countries.”

Thunberg was among 12 activists undertaking the journey to attempt to circumvent Israel's aid blockade of Gaza when they were stopped by the Israeli navy and brought ashore at the port of Ashdod.

The statement added that those activists who refused to sign deportation papers and leave Israel would be brought before a judicial authority “to authorize their deportation.”

Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, said in a statement Monday that it had met with 11 of the 12 people detained following the Madleen’s interception before some of them, who consented to deportation, flew out of Tel Aviv.

It said at least four people had been deported or were being deported from Israel, while eight remained in detention at Givon prison in Ramla and planned to contest their deportation before an Israeli tribunal. They were expected to appear before a immigration detention review tribunal Tuesday morning.

The Madleen, dubbed the “Freedom Flotilla” by activists, departed Sicily earlier this month in a bid to break Israel's naval blockade which has been in place since 2007, when Hamas rose to power in the Gaza Strip, and deliver aid to Palestinians.

The vessel departed as Israel allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza after lifting a widely condemned blockade that had barred the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies for more than two months.

In a post on X, an account run by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry said that more than 1,200 aid trucks had entered Gaza from Israel “within the past two weeks,” with just more than 10 million meals distributed from aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the group tasked with distributing food under a controversial new system.

The GHF's centers have been intermittently closed over the week after dozens of Palestinians were shot and killed near its operations.

Gaza has a population of around 2.1 million people, so the meals the foreign affairs ministry referenced would, over the course of two weeks, equate to roughly a third of a meal per day for each member of the population.

Before the war, more than 500 trucks had been entering Gaza daily, according to the British Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.

Thunberg, a climate activist, said the mission was essential amid global silence on Israel's actions in Gaza.

The Madleen was also carrying Thiago Ávila, a Brazilian activist and politician; Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament; and Baptiste André, a French doctor who traveled with the group to assist passengers injured in any potential confrontations with Israeli forces.

Adalah said Ávila and Hassan were among the eight people still detained, with André among those deported.

The yacht was intercepted Monday, with video posted by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition showing the activists onboard raising their hands as lights flashed from boats surrounding the vessel.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the military to “screen the October 7 massacre video to the flotilla passengers upon their arrival at Ashdod Port.”

Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage in a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.

Since then, more than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/trump-travel-ban-myanmar-civil-war-visa-rcna211500,"A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She’d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother’s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.

The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn’t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country’s active civil war.

With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.

“It’s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,” said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a “rug got pulled out from under us in an instant.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump’s policy is in the “best interest of the American people and their safety.”

“His commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,” Jackson said. “The restrictions fulfill the President’s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.”

The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.

According to Trump’s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed “unacceptable.” A few countries lacked “the competence of the central authority” for issuing passports, the proclamation said.

Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.

“Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,” the proclamation said.

However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.

Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.

The new travel ban comes as Myanmar’s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.

“Junta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,” Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. “More than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.”

Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there’s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump’s immigration policies.

“It’s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn’t do their job or didn’t believe that their visa was true,” the woman's husband said. “It’s quite frankly terrifying.”

For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.

“Their circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,” the woman said. “My brother was concerned for his children’s future and education.”

Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn’t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother’s kids had aged out of the system.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.

At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar’s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.

“The reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,” the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. “Now, it’s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.”

Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of “the engine of Trump’s mass deportation machine.”

“It’s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole — especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,” Dinh said.

Rather than protecting individuals’ safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump’s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.

“It perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who’ve been separated,” Dinh said.

She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.

“We’ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,” the woman's husband said. “Now, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries … without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They’ve done nothing wrong.”",World
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/africa/rwanda-congo-war-hidden-invasion-trump-peace-talks-rcna209051,"Open secret

From the start, Rwanda has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal its intervention in the Kivu provinces in eastern Congo, which went from a couple of hundred soldiers in 2021 to an estimated 5,000 today.

But there have been lapses in Rwanda’s secrecy. In May 2022, Congolese forces announced they had captured two Rwandan soldiers who had entered the country. Rwanda denied this, claiming the soldiers were kidnapped across the border.

NBC News obtained a Rwandan military report that admitted that these soldiers were captured while taking part in an M23 attack on barracks at Rumangabo military base. The internal report says members of the Rwanda Defence Force crossing the border were supposed to leave cellphones behind and strip identifying insignia from their uniforms. It recommends punishment for the soldiers’ commander for failing to ensure the captured soldiers did so.

In a bid to remove witnesses, Rwandan soldiers forced Congolese villagers to evacuate areas they occupied, according to a contractor hired to provide intelligence for the Congolese military.

Operations like this drove hundreds of thousands from their homes.

“This is not business as usual in the DRC,” Antoine Sagot-Priez, Congo country director for the aid agency Concern Worldwide, said in March, commenting on the mass displacement. “We need people to know what is happening here.”

These villagers ended up living in 17 camps around the city of Goma, the capital of Congo’s North Kivu province, that would eventually swell to hold 400,000 to 500,000 people.

Reports drawn up by the same contractor state that Rwandan forces were moving their mortars in and out of Congo — sometimes each day — apparently to avoid detection. Rwandan soldiers also often don outfits usually worn by the M23 rebels.

Much of the information used in this report was compiled by Western military experts, who included former French army officers, Romanians, Poles and Bulgarians, hired by Congo President Felix Tshisekedi in 2022 when he realized his army was disastrously losing ground. They were assigned the task of protecting cities in the east and providing Congo’s artillery with key information — thanks to a small fleet of Chinese drones.

In March 2023, these new hires helped turn the tables on the Rwandans attacking the town of Sake, west of Goma, by hitting their mortar positions with Sukhoi fighter jets.

The entire Rwandan force in Congo withdrew the following day.

Military contractors believe this was the moment Rwanda — one of Africa’s poorest states and heavily dependent on foreign aid — went on an international military shopping spree, placing orders in Poland and Turkey for sophisticated anti-missile systems, drones and signal-jamming equipment.

Then in late 2023, Rwandan forces began returning to Congo.

This time the numbers were 10 times higher than before — 3,000 to 5,000 men, according to the same military contractor. The Congolese army put its new drones to devastating use.

Satellite imagery shows a sudden, dramatic increase in the number of graves at Kanombe Military Cemetery, Rwanda’s main military burial ground in the capital, Kigali. It expanded by some 350 graves between mid-2023 and early 2024, according to a manual count carried out by NBC News. The images also show that from late 2021 to today, the cemetery has added 900 graves, even though the country says it is not engaged in any military conflict in Congo.

Rwanda’s government spokesperson declined to comment on the fresh graves, saying: “Speculation about a military cemetery in Kigali has no basis in reality.”

The DRC’s air superiority did not last long.

According to senior Congolese army officers, Rwanda used the opportunity presented by a U.S.-negotiated truce to install Chinese-made Yitian anti-missile systems in Congo. The addition in early 2024 of GPS-jamming equipment turned the war’s tide, making it nearly impossible for the DRC’s hired contractors to deploy their drone fleet.

“The new equipment changed everything,” said Gen. Sylvain Ekenge, a Congolese army spokesman. “When we were asked by the Americans for a ceasefire to calm things down, the Rwandans used it as a chance to bring in these systems.”",World

The brush heads are easy to rinse and the unit came with a little stand to stick the brush heads too while they are drying. Always wash your electric toothbrush heads after use and store them separate from the unit to dry - or they get skunky, funky and gunky. It’s a little extra work compared to just rinsing off a manual toothbrush. But hygiene is important. I want to buy one of these Oral B io3 toothbrushes for everybody I know.” — Spunky Punky Sparkle Princess

“My dentist recommended this toothbrush―-any of the oral b, io models. I bought the least expensive and the thing is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever had. I have only used it twice and feel a significant difference in how clean my teeth feel. It feels like the plaque is being shook off my teeth in a good way. Just like how your teeth feel after a good cleaning at the dentist. HIGHLY recommend.” — Kelly Brock

“I literally feel like I’ve gone to the dentist after using this toothbrush. It’s so effective without feeling harsh. I love this toothbrush. Prior to this Oral-B toothbrush, I was using Philips Sonicare. I will never go back. Oral B is way better. Now I just need to see if it lasts longer. The carrying case it comes with is great, it charges fast, and I’m just overall really happy with this toothbrush.” — Spenser

“I had an older Oral-B electric toothbrush that I loved, but it was getting older. So I bought this one, liking the fact that it had a carrying case for travel. Wow! This brush is almost ultrasonic on your teeth, and so easy to use! It will hold a charge for about a week (I haven’t tried longer), so I can take it on trips without the charger, and not have to go without my electric toothbrush- yay!” — Kindle Customer

“If you are new to the electric toothbrush world or have dabbled with cheaper disposable AA battery-powered brushes, this is the best entry point. This is a great brush—it has everything you need and nothing extra. The pressure light is helpful, and the 30-second timer pulse is great. Everything is well thought out. Your teeth will feel dentist-visit clean everyday.” — Caleb M Smith

“WOW! This is the best toothbrush I’ve ever used! It lets you know if you are brushing to hard, or soft, by a flashing light around the top. And it gives you that after dentist cleaning feeling. Worth ever penny!!” — Amazon Customer",Automobile

Microwaving steam-in-bag veggies, rice and other foods is a quick and convenient way to meal prep. You heat the bag for a few minutes, and the contents are ready to eat — no portioning, chopping or washing required. But how safe is it to use these? Could the plastic from the packaging seep into the foods and cause health concerns?

“There is ongoing scientific debate about the long-term effects of low-level exposure to … some plastics, especially under high heat,” said Bryan Quoc Le, food scientist and founder of Mendocino Food Consulting. “While most modern steam bags are … [free of BPA and other harmful chemicals, there are still concerns] about lesser-known additives and the cumulative impact of plastic use.”

We spoke with experts about the safety of using steam-in-bag food products — and whether there are alternative cooking methods they recommend instead.

So, how risky is it to consume steam-in-bag foods?

Steam-in-bag food products aren’t only popular because of their convenience, but they also offer a few safety benefits.

Advertisement

“[They] are designed for minimal handling from production to plate, reducing the risk of cross-contamination in home kitchens,” explained Darin Detwiler, a food safety expert and professor at Northeastern University. Plus, they are “typically frozen or vacuum-sealed, extending shelf life well beyond that of fresh produce,” Detwiler added.

However, concerns exist about the risks associated with using and heating plastic packaging, particularly when one is consistently exposed to microplastics (tiny pieces of plastic) over time.

“Microplastics can enter food through contaminated water, environmental exposure and plastic packaging,” Le said. While more research is needed, “early studies link … [them] to inflammation, hormone disruption and possible immune effects.”

That said, steam-in-bag foods are generally considered safe when you carefully follow the instructions on the packaging, he added.

Advertisement

“These products are made from food-grade, microwave-safe plastics that meet FDA standards and undergo … testing to ensure they don’t leach harmful chemicals, like BPA or phthalates,” he explained.

Still, there’s a chance you could be exposed to low levels of chemicals and microplastics by using them, said Jamie Alan, associate professor in the department of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University.

“We come into contact with microplastics every day … [they’re] everywhere,” she said. “And we are still trying to understand their long-term health risks.”

Adrienne Bresnahan via Getty Images It's almost just as easy to toss your frozen vegetables into a microwave-safe glass container.

Should we avoid using ‘steam-in-bag’ foods?

While “there’s not yet conclusive evidence” on how they affect our health, “minimizing avoidable plastic exposure where practical — especially at high heat — is a reasonable precaution,” Detwiler explained.



Alan recommends looking for ways that work for your individual life to limit exposure.

“For example, if you usually consume vegetables steamed in these bags, perhaps you can continue to do so while drinking water out of non-plastic containers,” she said. “It would take quite a bit of resources and effort to completely avoid exposure to microplastics.”

Is there a safer method?

“Plastics degrade with repeated or excessive heating, so alternative methods may offer added peace of mind — especially for frequent use,” Le explained.

Detwiler said transferring the food from the steam-in-bag to a glass or ceramic dish before microwaving can be a safer alternative. You can use the directions on the bag as general guidelines, but you shouldn’t solely rely on this, he added.

“Those instructions are calibrated specifically for cooking inside the bag, where steam builds up and circulates heat more effectively,” he said.

Advertisement

When heating in a dish, he recommends using a food thermometer to make sure the internal temperature of the food reaches at least 165°F (74°C). You can also cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid to help the heat distribute evenly. To avoid cold spots, pause the cooking midway so you can stir or rotate the food, he advised.

When you do microwave steam-in-bag foods, follow these important steps.

“Using [steam-in-bag products] exactly as directed is important, since overheating or improper use can compromise their safety,” Le said.

A few key safety tips from Detwiler:

Pay attention to the heating time and power level of the microwave. Undercooking could allow bacteria to survive, such as Listeria, Salmonella, or E. coli , and overheating increases the risk of chemicals leaching into the food.

Don’t reheat the bags. “They’re single-use only and not designed to withstand repeated heating.”

Don’t store food in the bag after microwaving. “Transfer leftovers to food-safe containers to avoid prolonged exposure to heat-softened plastics.”

Don’t use the bag if it’s “damaged, punctured or warped.” This could increase the risk of contamination and plastics leaking into the food. When cooking, the “bag may [also] leak steam prematurely” and cause “uneven heating or failure to reach safe temperatures.”

Don’t microwave only some of the contents. “The remaining food may not receive adequate steam or time to cook safely.” If you want to only heat some of the food, transfer it to a microwave-safe dish instead.",Science

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was slammed online for recent comments she made about the Los Angeles community amid ongoing tensions surrounding protests in the city against mass raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

During a Monday night appearance on Fox News show “Hannity,” both host Sean Hannity and Noem criticized California’s so-called “sanctuary” policies which, in general, limits cooperation with federal immigration officials.

Advertisement

Noem went on to charge that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) have done “absolutely nothing” about crime in the city.

“Now she’s holding press conferences talking about the fact that people have the right to peacefully protest, and that they’re a city of immigrants,” Noem said about Bass on “Hannity” before she leveled a disparaging dig about Angelenos.

Advertisement

“Well, they’re not a city of immigrants; they’re a city of criminals,” she continued. “Because she has protected them for so many years.”

People in Los Angeles have taken to the streets to protest the Trump administration’s ICE raids in their neighborhoods. Newsom has accused Trump of escalating the situation after he deployed Marines and National Guard troops in California to counter the protests. The president justified his decision to do so — despite objections from Newsom — telling reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was done playing by the rules.

Newsom has accused the president of wanting to fuel chaos in Los Angeles. The last time a president deployed the National Guard without cooperation from a governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect civil rights protesters.

People on X, formerly Twitter, slammed Noem’s comments about Los Angeles, the second largest city in the country, which has rich cultural diversity. Many called her comments “dehumanizing.”

Speaking about Noem’s comments on “Hannity,” Collin Anderson, a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, said that it’s “always concerning to hear a high-ranking federal employee paint entire swathes of the country with a broad brush.”

He emphasized that it’s important to remember that “federal employees are public servants who are supposed to serve the people.”

via Associated Press A protester photographed holding up a sign in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles on Monday.

Noem calling Los Angeles “a city of criminals” is a tactic — and it’s dangerous.

Anderson said that Noem’s comments that Los Angeles is “a city of criminals” is an attempt to “paint the situation in LA as quite dire.”

He said that if news reports suggest that “all of LA is burning,” and the city is “brimming with criminals,” then people “will be more likely to support harsher measures to bring what they perceive to be as out of control violence” — even though, he said, people participating in the protests “represent only a fraction of a percentage of the population” of the city, and that the demonstrations are confined to “a geographic area of a few square miles.”

Advertisement

And Anderson said that baselessly describing people as criminals — people who “for the most part have not gone through due process to determine their criminality or not” is meant to cast them as being in an “out-group” — a “group that isn’t part of ‘proper’ society.”

“Dehumanizing language is dangerous, and society must always be vigilant about it, lest we repeat the horrors of the past,” he said. “The last thing to remember in all of this [is] rights are either for everyone, or they are for no one.”

“If someone else’s rights are being violated, your rights can be too,” he continued.

Jaime Dominguez, a political scientist and associate professor of Instruction at Northwestern University Weinberg College of Arts & Sciences, said that Noem’s comments about Los Angeles reflect an “overarching theme” within the Trump administration, which is to criminalize immigrants and “seeing immigrants through just this linear lens.”

Advertisement

“And the lens is, of course, that they’re not a citizen, they don’t care about the country, they’re not invested in the country,” he said.

Dominguez said that viewing immigrants this way gives Noem and other members of the Trump administration the “leverage to basically target immigrants” and to push a narrative that they’re “not invested in our country.”

He emphasized that this strategy from the current administration is dangerous.

“Once you dehumanize the immigrant in the eyes of the public, then the public will become immune and desensitized to what we see happening on the street,” he said, before later adding: “It’s out of the playbook of authoritarian figures.”

Dominguez also stressed that Trump’s decision to send troops to Los Angeles is part of his tactic to create “chaos” and “disorder” — and to make it seem as though he’s the one fixing it.",World

As protests broke out in downtown Los Angeles in response to ICE raids and the Trump administration’s immigration policies, a number of protesters held up Mexican flags. Some brandished them with U.S. flags. Others waved only Mexican flags.

But for national audiences watching the protests, the sheer number of Mexican flags on display proved divisive: For every headline that read “Mexican flag symbolizes pride in Los Angeles protests” there were at least double that criticized the flag’s presence over the weekend.

Immigration policies aren’t just politics — they’re personal. At HuffPost, we explore the human stories behind the headlines, reporting on how immigration laws impact real people and communities. Support this vital coverage by joining our membership program today.

“How Mexican Flag Photos Are a Gift to Donald Trump,” politics reporter Dan Gooding wrote in Newsweek, while right-leaning tabloid the New York Post deemed the footage and photos as “the perfect propaganda footage for Trump.”

By Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was alluding to the flags in his testimony to a House panel. Though he couldn’t identify what legal authority President Donald Trump had to deploy the National Guard and Marines to LA, he said troops need to be called in “if you’ve got millions of illegals and you don’t know where they’re coming from, they’re waving flags from foreign countries and assaulting police officers and laws.”

Even centrists and some on the left had conflicted feelings about the flags. So did Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University and the author of “White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism.”

“Look, protesters can wave whatever they want, but as someone who’s written about protests like this, I’d politely suggest if you’re trying to dispel racist claims that you’re an army from a foreign country, maybe *don’t* wave a foreign country’s flag as you square off against US troops?” he wrote on Bluesky.

Kruse noted that both Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement and Cesar Chavez during the “1,000 Mile March” for farmworker rights in California used the American flag as a visual argument that the movement was wholly American.

The post quickly went viral, with others agreeing with Kruse that what’s happening now felt like a big PR blunder.

Cathy Murphy via Getty Images Cesar Chavez during the ""1,000 Mile March"" for farm-worker rights in California, used the American flag as a visual argument that the movement was wholly American, said Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University and the author of ""White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism.""

Kruse was met with a wave of criticism, too: As Latino communities continue to come under attack ― with ICE and military agents in tactical gear raiding their places of work and routine immigration check-ins ― whose place is it to question their peaceful means of protest? (Others took issue with the claim about Chavez and the American flag since there were Mexican and Huelga flags ― which include an Aztec eagle ― at his marches, too.)

“If you want more American flags at protests, you are welcome to go to the protests and fly one. No one will stop you. You yourself can create that picture of tolerance and pluralism,” attorney and political pundit Will Stancil wrote on Bluesky. “But don’t sit on the sidelines and tell a community under racist assault not to assert its right to exist.”

Later in the day, Kruse deleted the post, apologizing for being a little “tone deaf.” “[I’m] still very much behind these protests and hope my worries will prove to be misplaced,” he wrote.

Advertisement

Tone deaf is how Ian B. Bautista, a Milwaukeean of Mexican descent, saw criticism like Kruse’s. For Bautista and many other Mexican Americans, the flag of Mexico is as American as apple pie ― or at least an Our Lady of Guadalupe candle. We’re a melting pot, and at this point, the Mexican flag is deeply ingrained in Chicano culture, Bautista told HuffPost ― not to mention LA culture.

“The Mexican flag is no more ‘foreign’ to El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula than the Dodgers, lowriders, the Coliseum, pupusas, Kendrick Lamar, Korean BBQ, the beach, Hollywood or the Lakers,” Bautista wrote on Bluesky, invoking LA’s original Spanish name.

If there is a protest involving anything even marginally concerning Mexican American or Latino rights, expect to see a Mexican flag, he told HuffPost.

“Almost 100 out of 100 times, when a Mexican-American or [Chicano] protests, it’s safe to bet that the Mexican flag will be depicted in banners or signs,” said Bautista, who works for a nonprofit in the community building field.

VCG via Getty Images The sheer number of Mexican flags on display at LA protests this weekend proved divisive.

That’s certainly true in Los Angeles, which was once Mexican territory. LA was a Spanish city until 1821, when Mexico gained independence from Spain, and California fell under the rule of the newly created Mexican nation.

Advertisement

In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, the region and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States.

In the wake of that, LA has seen “generations and generations of colonial and military violence, one that regularly targets Mexican, Black and Native people for the U.S. political desires,” said Michael Lechuga, the chair and an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico.

That all-too recent history only emboldens today’s Latino Angelenos to reach for the Mexican flag in times of protest.

Advertisement

For Bautista, he’s personally more inclined to wave an American and Mexican flag simultaneously when he protests or celebrates his community. He’s not alone; some protesters in LA have held up flags that are half Mexican, half American in design.

Still, those criticizing protesters waving exclusively Mexican flags are coming from “a very privileged place,” Bautista said.

“Racists ― as has been proven throughout our nation’s history ― will express and assert racism without reasons,” he said. “If a ‘foreign’ flag ― and it’s arguable that the Mexican flag is ‘foreign’ to Los Angeles ― sets off racists or provides optics that are not according to white-centered perceptions of what ‘America’ is, then so be it.”

In a highly visual society, the Mexican flag is a symbol of protest and solidarity.

Social movements and protests have always been fundamentally visual in nature: Think of the lone man standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square, or the transformative role videos on social media played in the Arab Spring uprisings.

“In the U.S. today especially, we have largely moved away from political dialogues and moved toward symbol wars,” Lechuga said.

While the Mexican flag has a rich history and meaning removed from current events in the U.S., Lechuga said that today it’s used as a silent, visual-only response to the xenophobic and inciting rhetoric the Trump administration has used to characterize people from Mexico and those from Latin American at large: “drug dealers,” “criminals,” “rapists.”

“In other words, the Mexican flag at this week’s protests is a symbol of resistance,” he said. “When ‘Mexicanness’ is the target of this administration, holding the object that’s seen as the quickest reference to it is rebellious.”

“And maybe, at this point in history, the Mexican flag is a stand-in for all migrants and for those that support them,” he said. “The conflation of all Latin Americans with ‘Mexicanness,’ for instance, is pretty common.”

Leisy J. Abrego, a professor of Chicana/o and Central American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, agrees that the Mexican flag has taken on larger symbolism in the U.S. immigration debate.

“The current president and his administration are saying in words, policies, and chaos-inducing actions that they hate immigrant communities,” she said. “Whether they are immigrants, children or grandchildren of immigrants, the protesters are putting their bodies on the line for their own and other people’s dignity.”

In a moment when the highest leaders of this country want to deny them a sense of belonging, embracing the Mexican flag is not anti-American, per se, but a symbolic reminder that there’s another place to belong, Abrego siad.

“The flags from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua are just reminders that immigrants can belong in multiple places,” she told HuffPost. “Most importantly, though, these protesters are there to protect their community visibly and make the statement proudly that immigrants are not alone.”

When 'Mexicanness' is the target of this administration, holding the object that's seen as the quickest reference to it is rebellious,"" said Michael Lechuga, the chair and an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico.

Some have noted that it didn’t seem to be much of a problem to those on the far right when Jan. 6 protesters brought their other flags to the U.S. capitol. Lechuga has thought about it, too, as the “what flag belongs” debate has waged this week.

“In addition to several Confederate flags and original 13-star colonial U.S., there were some people on Jan. 6 waving a South Vietnamese flag and Indian flag,” he said. “Some who believe that the far right and largely anti-communist movements associated with those flags are the reason why some protesters brought them to the riot.”

As for whether the number of Mexican flags at the protests is “perfect propaganda” for Trump, Lechuga thinks you could make the case that the president’s team is adept at turning almost anything into propaganda for its agenda.

“It’s easy for an outside observer of the situation to give advice to protesters, like an armchair quarterback with no skin in the game,” he said. “But I am not sure if it’s the job of the demonstrator to convince the ICE agents or Marines that they are not an angry invading mob of foreign nationals.”

As you cook, store food and even brew your morning coffee or tea, you may be inadvertently adding microplastics to your food and drinks. These tiny plastic particles are increasingly showing up not only in our food but also in our bodies (Heads up: they’ve been found throughout the body, from the brain to the blood, liver and placenta).

A big way microplastics get into our food is through contaminated soil, water and air. But it can also happen right in the kitchen, through simple daily habits that you likely have a lot of control over. Whether you’re chopping veggies on a plastic cutting board or reheating last night’s dinner in a plastic container, you may be increasing your exposure to microplastics.

Advertisement

As of now, a lot more research is needed to get a better understanding of how microplastics and nanoplastics might directly affect or harm human health. But some early research results allow us to see that the potential health consequences may not be great. For example, research findings from one observational study show that microplastics found in arteries may potentially increase the risk of having a stroke and heart disease.

If you’re concerned about your microplastic exposure — and how your kitchen habits may be playing a role — we have some good news. In most cases, you can lean into some simple, plastic-free swaps.

Here are six ways microplastics might be making their way into your food and drinks due to your kitchen habits, and what you can use instead.

1. Plastic Cutting Boards

Many people rely on plastic cutting boards because they’re nonporous and can be easier to clean. But this may not be the best idea. When you cut food on a plastic cutting board, you’re often putting microplastics directly into your food. And research shows that the stronger the cut, the more microplastics are released.

“Plastic cutting boards are one of the biggest exposure rates and one of the easiest things to switch out,” said Jennifer Brandon, a microplastics expert, oceanographer and founder of Wild Beacon Consulting.

In a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, researchers found that people may be exposed to up to 50 grams of microplastics each year from using plastic chopping boards in the kitchen. “For reference, a credit card is five grams, so that’s a lot of plastic,” Brandon said.

What can you use instead?

Consider using a wood or bamboo cutting board.

2. Heating Food In Plastic Storage Containers

If much of your meal prep involves reheating food in plastic containers, you may want to change your ways. When many plastic storage containers are heated, microplastics can leach into your food. Plastic containers that are safe to use in the microwave are typically labeled “microwave safe,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But take-out containers, yogurt containers, margarine tubs and other containers designed for one-time use should not be used in the microwave, they say. Still, many experts have cautioned against heating food in plastic containers, even if they’re labeled microwave safe.

“There was a study that heated a plastic food container with just water in it, and they found more than 10 million microplastics that were leached into the water that was in that container,” said Victoria Fulfer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island and researcher specializing in microplastic pollution at the 5 Gyres Institute.

Heating bags of frozen vegetables right in their plastic packaging isn’t the greatest idea, either. Similar to microwave-safe plastic containers, packages of vegetables labeled as microwave safe should be fine to use. But there’s not a lot of research available on this, and many experts advise against heating food in plastic. “When you’re heating them up, it’s causing the bonds in the plastic to break, and that allows microplastics and nanoplastics and also those chemicals in the plastic to get directly into your food,” Fulfer said. “And that can be a big problem because those are really small particles.”

A recent class-action lawsuit against Ziploc’s parent company alleges that the company’s “microwave safe” marketing claims are misleading due to the potential for releasing microplastics when heated — however, the company maintains that the products are safe.

What can you use instead?

Swap out your plastic storage containers for oven or microwave-safe glass containers. These do not leach microplastics or chemicals into your food and are generally more durable.

And rather than heating plastic veggies directly in their plastic packaging, transfer them to a glass container to heat them in the microwave or to a pan for heating on the stove.

3. Using Disposable Plastic Storage Bags

Do you tend to store your snacks and leftovers in plastic storage bags? If so, it may be time to find an alternative. “These plastics are soft, so they shed plastic flakes easily, which can become a considerable health risk for those that often use these types of bags,” said Bryan Quoc Le, food scientist and food industry consultant.

In a 2020 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers found that simply opening plastic packaging — whether through snipping with scissors, tearing a bag, twisting or cutting with a knife — can generate microplastics. The amount generated varied depending on the thickness of the plastic packaging, but the researchers noted that this sends a warning about the importance of using care when opening plastic packaging for those who are concerned about microplastics.

What can you use instead?

Use reusable silicone bags, stainless steel or glass containers or beeswax wraps.

4. Using Plastic Wrap Against Hot Food

Plastic wrap can release plastic particles into food, “especially when placed directly against hot food, since it is such a soft plastic,” Le said. “Depending on factors such as the temperature and moisture of the food, this could pose serious problems because some of the plastic wrap could actually melt onto the food, which would become a major hazard.”

What can you use instead?

Cover your food loosely with aluminum foil (but do not put this in the microwave), or use reusable silicone stretch wraps, beeswax wraps or a glass container with a lid.

5. Cooking With Plastic Utensils

Do you still cook with plastic utensils? Research shows that these release substantial amounts of microplastic particles with normal use, which can then be ingested with food. When heated, this is an even bigger problem.

“As we use them on our hot pans — you’ve probably noticed if you use them at home — they start to melt a little, and plastic will come off of them,” Fulfer said.

What can you use instead?

Ditch your plastic cooking utensils and switch to products made of wood or metal, depending on what type of pan you’re cooking with.

6. Using Plastic Tea Bags

Many tea bags are made of a type of plastic called polypropylene. When you brew these tea bags in water that’s been heated to a high temperature, the bag can begin to break down and release microplastics. Others made of nylon and cellulose have also been found to release microplastics.

Researchers in Spain and Canada, for example, found that plastic tea bags may release millions or even billions of microplastic particles when steeped in hot water.

“The danger of this is that these millions of microplastics and nanoplastics can enter the bloodstream and [gastrointestinal] tract, and can be quite small, and may be small enough to cross the blood/brain barrier, as we have seen with other nanoplastics,” Brandon said.

As a millennial kid growing up before eco-friendly-everything was commonly available and sought-after, I remember a big roll of Saran wrap always hanging out in the kitchen cabinet. Leftovers of all kinds, from raw steaks to casseroles to pudding to brownies, were stored in their cooking or serving vessels, but with a tight layer of plastic wrap stretched over the top. That just seemed like the obvious way to protect food from oxygen, insects or weird fridge odors.

But as I’ve grown up and started to pay more attention to my plastic usage, I now wonder whether my mom’s supposed failsafe method really keeps cooked dishes and raw ingredients fresh.

I turned to a food scientist, an attorney who specializes in foodborne illnesses, and a number of academic sources to dig into these questions, and here’s what I learned.

Plastic wrap is an effective storage solution because it protects food from air and particle exposure.

Simply put, plastic wrap — which is usually made of food-safe low-density polyethylene, or LDPE — “is actually quite effective because it’s able to produce a very stable and tight seal at the edges of a container,” said Bryan Quoc Le, founder and principal food Consultant at Mendocino Food Consulting.

This wrap is designed to cling, so “by reducing the ability of particles and air to come in contact with the food, food can stay fresher for a few more days, so long as contamination has been limited between when the food was cooked and when it was stored,” Le continued.

Most plastic wraps are designed to work in the fridge and freezer, and they often work better at colder temperatures.

Plastic wrap can certainly be used to store items at room temperature (like pastries and breads), but Le told us that it truly comes into its own when it’s exposed to cold temperatures. “Plastic wrap can increase its stickiness when used in the freezer, and is actually quite effective at colder temperatures,” he said. Essentially, when it comes to plastic wrap’s fresh-sealing power, the colder, the better.

As far as specific timing goes, Le explained that “plastic wrap can extend the freshness of food by about a day or two at room temperature, by three to four days in the fridge, and for several months in the freezer so long as there is as little air as possible between the food and the plastic wrap.”

In fact, he generally recommends reserving plastic wrap for freezer and fridge storage. “It’s best to use plastic wrap for foods that you want to store for long periods of time [in the freezer] because of its ability to limit moisture and air transfer from and to the food. That is where plastic wrap is most effective,” Le said. This long storage idea also applies to the use of plastic wrap in the refrigerator: “In some cases, like [with] cheeses or preserved meats, plastic wrap does truly shine in its ability to keep these foods fresh even in the refrigerator because these foods last quite a while. Most foods with a long shelf life in the refrigerator can become rancid if exposed to oxygen, so using plastic wrap in this case to protect these foods is beneficial.”

For shorter-term storage (like a dish that will be eaten soon after placing it in the fridge or a fresh-baked pastry that will be stored on the countertop until it’s eaten within a couple of days), Le recommended using “a plastic or glass container” instead of plastic wrap.

Plastic wrap shouldn’t be microwaved unless it has a microwave-safe symbol on the packaging.

Since Saran Wrap switched from the stronger PVC plastic to the reliably food-safe LDPE in the early 2000s, plastic wrap as a general category has been considered very safe by food professionals and the medical community. The one exception to this principle involves plastic wrap that’s exposed to heat.

The American Osteopathic Association — a medical organization representing osteopathic physicians — explains that not all types of plastic wrap are microwave-safe, and that if a non-heat-safe plastic is exposed to that type of heat while in contact with food, the plastic itself can melt or leach chemicals into the food item.

For that reason, it’s crucial to check the packaging of your plastic wrap to make sure that it’s specifically designated as microwave-safe. Also, when putting plastic wrap on food before microwaving, follow the AOA’s advice and “leave at least one inch between plastic wrap and food before heating.”

While plastic wrap generally can’t be recycled using curbside pickup, many grocery stores and retailers have drop-off bins.

If you, like me, have concerns about plastic wrap’s effect on the environment, you may be relieved to learn that, contrary to popular belief, it is often possible to recycle plastic wrap after use. The only catch is that this type of plastic can’t currently be recycled through curbside pickup.

But according to America’s Plastic Makers (a nonprofit group of scientists, engineers, designers and technicians dedicated to finding a most sustainable future for the plastics industry), “there are thousands of retail stores and drop-off centers that accept plastic film packaging for recycling. You likely have seen the recycling bins outside/inside many large retailers. These retailers collect plastic film packaging from consumers like you and from back-of-the-store packaging, [and] they haul this plastic film to multiple businesses that recycle it into new products.”

Eco-friendly alternatives to plastic wrap include reusable silicone covers and beeswax wrap.

Plastic wrap can be part of sustainable kitchen storage practices (which is very good news for my mom and other folks who feel attached to this convenient stretchy stuff), but other alternatives exist that further improve on the eco-friendly idea. “Reusable food storage bags made from food-grade silicone may be a safer alternative to disposable, single-use plastic bags or even plastic wraps,” said Jason Reese, co-founder and partner attorney at Wagner Reese, a firm specializing in personal injury and foodborne illnesses.

Sealable silicone containers and silicone covers (which can be snugly fitted over a bowl or serving dish) are easy to clean and durable options; Iowa State University researchers said that “per the FDA, food-grade silicone is safe and will not react with other materials or release hazardous compounds or fumes when heated. Food-grade silicone is safe to store food, put in the microwave, freezer, oven and dishwasher without hardening, cracking, peeling or becoming brittle as it is resistant to extreme temperatures; It will not leak, break down, or degrade over time.”

Another popular swap-in for plastic are food wraps coated in beeswax. The University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources praised beeswax wrap by saying that it “presents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to plastic film wraps. In contrast to plastic wraps that contribute to pollution and have a slow decomposition process lasting years, beeswax wraps naturally break down, mitigating their environmental impact.”",Science
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/razor-sore-throat-painful-covid-symptom_l_6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061,"apomares via Getty Images Some people in China are reporting severe sore throat with COVID infections right now.

A positive COVID-19 test result is not something that anyone wants to see — but now there may be an extra reason to avoid getting sick.

COVID infections cause miserable symptoms such as fever, fatigue, congestion and more. Now, though, some people infected with COVID in China are reporting a very sore throat that’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat.”

According to Google trends data, people throughout the U.S. are now, too, worried about this scary-sounding symptom and are searching for things like “new covid variant painful symptom” and “covid razor throat.”

Just how worried do you need to be about a super-painful sore throat during a COVID infection? Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:

Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.

“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.

A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said Dr. Carrie Horn, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.

Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.

While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.

There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said Dr. Mark Burns, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added.

“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.

Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:

COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.

“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.

This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.

“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.

Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.

If you do get sick, there are treatments available.

If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.

It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.

COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.

It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.

A bronzy glow may be the look you want for summer, but you likely know that sunbathing or using tanning beds could expose you to ultraviolet rays, which raise your risk for skin cancer. A spray tan may seem like a safer option for sun-kissed skin — but is it?

In reality, “the safest option is no tan via sun, tanning bed, spray or lotion,” Dr. Allison Larson, the physician executive director of dermatology at MedStar Health in Washington, D.C., told HuffPost. “Love the skin you have.”

Still, doctors recognize that you may want a tan. And spray tans are “definitely safer from a skin cancer perspective,” said Dr. Kenneth Mark, a cosmetic dermatologist in New York City. “We know that sun exposure and its ultraviolet rays damage our skin cells’ DNA and predispose us to skin cancer and skin aging, in general, including sun spots, wrinkles, thinning of skin and collagen breakdown.”

While spray tans are safer than lying out in the sun or using a tanning bed, they’re not risk-free. Here’s what medical experts want you to know about them.

How Do Spray Tans Work?

Spray tans are made of a sugar compound called dihydroxyacetone (DHA) that reacts to the proteins in the outer layer of your skin, giving you a bronzed color, said Marc Hurlbert, a pharmacologist and CEO of the Melanoma Research Alliance.

DHA is a colorless compound that’s applied as a fine mist by a trained technician. “It doesn’t involve melanin or UV exposure, just a surface-level chemical reaction,” Dr. Asmi Berry, a dermatologist in Los Angeles, told HuffPost. That reaction produces a temporary tan that fades over several days as your skin cells turn over and naturally exfoliate, she said.

The biggest benefit is that you get a tan without exposing yourself to UV rays, Hurlbert said. This is important, as skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., and 1 in 5 Americans will develop it in their lifetimes, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.

Spray tans also often produce quick results, Larson said. And if you struggle to apply self-tanners evenly, spray tans can provide “streak-free color,” Berry added.

“Spray tans are ideal if you want fast, all-over results and don’t want to risk sun exposure,” Berry said. “Compared to self-tanning lotions or mousses, spray tans can be more even and less messy, but they require a trip to the salon.”

MediaNews Group/Boulder Daily Camera via Getty Images via Getty Images The Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA for use in sunless tanners but not in spray tans.

The Biggest Spray Tan Risk

The Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA for use in sunless tanners but not in spray tans. The agency says, “the use of DHA in ‘tanning’ booths as an all-over spray has not been approved by the FDA.” The reason is that there’s a lack of safety data on the effects of inhaling the DHA mist.

Advertisement

This is notable, Larson said. “Based on animal and cell culture studies, we have reasons to be concerned about a negative impact on the lungs when DHA is inhaled. It is not yet known the degree of impact a spray tan would have, if inhaled, or how long this might last.”

Inhaling particles from a chemical that’s not tested for use as a spray tan could pose an “unknown risk” for anyone, but especially those with asthma or pregnant women, Hurlbert said. The impact of getting DHA in your eyes, mouth or nose is also unknown.

“So, ultimate all-around safety cannot be confirmed,” he noted.

Experts also aren’t sure how much DHA is absorbed into the body from the skin or what impact that will have, Larson said.

Is A Spray Tan Good For Your Skin?

There’s the potential for DHA to irritate your skin or cause an allergic reaction, Berry said. If you have a history of eczema or sensitive skin, she recommended doing a test patch or checking with your dermatologist first. Spray tans may also contain fragrances, which some people find irritating, Hurlbert said.

Getting spray tans too often could lead to a buildup of DHA on your skin, which might cause dryness, Berry said.

Keep in mind, too, that spray tans don’t protect your skin from UV rays — so you still need to wear sunscreen and take steps to reduce your risk for skin cancer, Larson said.

Advertisement

However, not everyone does that. A 2018 study published in JAMA Dermatology found that people who use sunless tanners often engaged in risky skin cancer-related behaviors, such as not seeking shade or wearing protective clothing outdoors. They were also more likely to report a recent sunburn.

Research also suggests that DHA application followed by sunlight exposure can lead to damaging free radical formation in the skin, which could possibly lead to skin cancer, Larson said. That’s why wearing sunscreen after a spray tan is crucial.

Other studies have shown that DHA could damage the DNA of skin cells, Mark said. DNA damage is linked to skin cancer and may hinder new cell growth.

How To Increase The Safety Of Spray Tans

Since we don’t know the full risk of inhaling DHA, Mark recommended covering your eyes, nose, lips and mouth during a spray tan to avoid exposure. However, he acknowledged, “That could prove challenging to also tan your face.”

And make sure the room is ventilated, Hurlbert added.

When you get a spray tan, they’ll tell you how long to leave it on before showering. Follow those directions to ensure the tan sets properly, and then moisturize daily to keep your skin barrier healthy and to maintain the tan, Berry said. And don’t forget to wear sunscreen before going outside, Larson emphasized.

The bottom line is spray tans are safer for skin than suntanning or using a tanning bed when it comes to skin cancer risk, Mark said. But they could still bring some safety concerns.

Getting a pedicure may be one of the first things you do when the weather warms up and you’re gearing up for sandal season. But there’s one tool doctors say you should never use on your feet: a cheese-grater foot file.

These foot files can actually do more harm than good, Dr. Saylee Tulpule, a board-certified podiatrist in Washington, D.C., told HuffPost. “As a podiatrist, I don’t recommend either using them on yourself or even going to a salon and having a nail technician use them to remove calluses or dry skin.”

Advertisement

These coarse metal files feature tiny, sharp blades, resembling a cheese grater, and are touted for their ability to remove thick, dry skin or calluses. They’ve been around for a while — you can purchase them from drugstores, and they’re all over TikTok.

Tulpule said she does get the appeal. “I have these thick calluses, so it sounds kind of innocuous: Why don’t I just use a rasp and try to file them off?” she said. It turns out there are actually a lot of reasons. Here’s what you should know about these common pedicure tools.

Advertisement

Here’s why grater-style foot files can be harmful.

These foot files can “provide instant gratification, seeing the dead skin slough off,” Sara Moghaddam, a board-certified dermatologist in Delaware, told HuffPost. “But when they are used with too much force, small raw wounds or cracks in the skin can occur.”

Advertisement

This makes you vulnerable to viruses and bacteria seeping in, which could lead to infections, she explained. For instance, the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes plantar warts can enter these tiny wounds, and a wart could pop up months later.

Using this type of foot file could also irritate the skin and cause bleeding, said Dr. Howard Sobel, a cosmetic dermatologic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He also doesn’t recommend these tools and has had patients who’ve been injured by them: “The grater went too deep and caused an ulceration that took weeks to heal.”

In her practice, Tulpule said she’s seen patients with “raw skin, bleeding skin, scrapes, infections, skin damage” from these tools.

She noted that people with diabetes or poor circulation in their feet should especially avoid them. They’re more prone to infections if they get a deep cut, she explained. “That could land someone in the hospital.”

Moyo Studio via Getty Images If you're at a salon, ask the technician to use a pumice stone instead of a metal rasp.

Graters actually aren’t an effective way to get rid of calluses.

Besides potentially causing an injury or infection, cheese grater-style foot files aren’t a good way to remove calluses, at least long-term. They can actually make rough skin worse.

Advertisement

Calluses form from repeated trauma and rubbing, Moghaddam said. When you file them with a rough, sharp tool, they may initially feel smoother, but they’ll usually grow back thicker, Sobel said.

“Frequent use with these can encourage the skin to want to protect itself and promote the skin to become thicker and harder over time,” Moghaddam said.

This is known as reactive hyperkeratosis and refers to the thickening of the outer layer of skin as a way to protect itself from irritation, Tulpule explained.

“When you use a cheese grater, you’re filing that epidermis,” she said. “If you end up going too deep into the dermis, you’re affecting the skin cells,” which can trigger callus regrowth.

“So, it almost is like a catch-22,” Tulpule added. “You’re trying to use a tool to get rid of your calluses, but if used improperly, it makes the problem worse over time.”

Should you avoid these types of foot files altogether?

Several state cosmetology boards have banned cheese grater foot files in nail salons. Others have discouraged their use.

The doctors HuffPost spoke to suggested avoiding these tools — not purchasing them to use at home and asking pedicurists not to use them if you go to a nail salon.

“I’d recommend a patient ask the nail salon to just smooth and moisturize the area with lotion rather than grating their calluses,” Sobel said.

Nail techs might not be trained on how aggressively to file, and if the tool is too sharp, it could lead to raw, red or cut skin, said Tulpule, who recently asked that a nail salon not use a cheese grater during her pedicure.

However, if you must use one, Moghaddam suggested applying very gentle pressure (or asking your pedicurist to do so) to avoid traumatizing the skin on the foot. And always make sure the file comes out of a sterile pack and has been sterilized properly.

There are more effective ways to get rid of calluses.

When you have dry, cracked skin or calluses on your feet, there are better ways to remove them to prevent them from growing back thicker and harder, Tulpule said.

Start by soaking your feet in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, which she said will soften the skin so it’s easier to remove.

Then, use a foot scrub or pumice stone to gently exfoliate your feet, Sobel said. Pumice stones aren’t as aggressive as graters, and you usually don’t scrape too deep into the skin with them, Tulpule said.

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends wetting the pumice stone with warm water and using a gentle circular or sideways motion to remove the dead skin. But be careful not to remove too much skin.

Moisturize your feet with lotions or creams that contain salicylic acid, ammonium lactate, or urea, AAD said. Some examples that Tulpule recommends include AmLactin Foot Repair Cream or CeraVe Renewing SA Foot Cream, which can be purchased at drugstores.

“These are natural exfoliating agents to help soften the skin gradually,” Moghaddam said. “It is best to apply it right after the bath or shower daily.”

Wearing properly fitting shoes that minimize friction or rubbing can help prevent calluses, she said. That includes flip-flops, which Moghaddam said are “big offenders and usually cause heel calluses to worsen.”

If the calluses or dry skin on your feet don’t improve or get worse, see a dermatologist or podiatrist. “Many rashes can be mistaken for callus or dry skin of the feet, which may need prescription treatment,” Moghaddam said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-definitive-guide-to-airplane-seat-etiquette-goog_l_6841d5ece4b092dc67e00f74,"Johan Marengrd / EyeEm via Getty Images Flying soon? Keep these considerations in mind when it comes to your seat.

Perhaps one of the biggest pains of air travel is the part where you have to sit for hours in a tight, cramped seat.

Over the years, there have been debates about the ethics of reclining your seat, sharing your armrests and other aspects of airplane etiquette. And people are divided when it comes to the question of how to use certain features ― or whether you should abstain entirely.

Advertisement

So what is the right way to approach these in-flight considerations? Below, five etiquette experts share the rules and general guidelines they follow as air travelers.

Reclining Your Seat

“Whether to recline your seat is a matter of polite awareness,” Jodi R.R. Smith, president of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting, told HuffPost. “We want to be able to maximize our comfort without inconveniencing anyone else. This is quite a challenge in the shrinking seats found nowadays on airplanes.”

She noted that reclining is the norm for red-eye or long-haul flights, where there’s an assumption that passengers will at least attempt to sleep. But for quick trips of under two hours, it’s better to just remain in the upright position.

If you want to recline your seat, show common courtesy to the person sitting behind you. Look back and make sure they aren’t super tall and already cramped. They could also be juggling a baby on their lap or wearing a knee brace. These would all be reasons to refrain from reclining. If you ultimately decide to do it, at least give a warning.

“It’s polite to alert someone behind you before reclining one’s seat,” said Nick Leighton, an etiquette expert and co-host of the podcast “Were You Raised By Wolves?” “I know I’ve nearly had my laptop snapped in half on more than one occasion by a seat that rapidly reclined without warning. And when reclining and going back up, it’s considerate to do it slowly. It’s easy to knock a hot cup of coffee off a tray with a seat that moves quickly.”

You might also consider just reclining partly, if possible.

“For those fortunate enough to be seated in first or business class, this is not an issue,” Smith said. “There is ample room to recline without impacting any other passenger’s personal space.”

Sharing Armrests

“The most commonly asked questions still remains ‘Who gets the armrest when seated in the middle seat?’” said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert, the author of “Modern Etiquette for a Better Life” and founder of the Protocol School of Texas. “The most obvious answer, and the unspoken rule of protocol, is the person sitting in the most uncomfortable seat ― the middle ― gets the armrests on both sides.”

Life etiquette expert Juliet Mitchell, also known as Ms. J, echoed this advice, noting that it’s simply about common courtesy and empathy.

“Let’s face it, this may not ever be a win-win situation,” she said. “However, if you are fortunate enough to have the window seat, you can look out on the lovely clouds and monitor the landing. If you get the aisle, you may be able to stretch out a bit, or at the very least, you can get up and stretch without disturbing others. The middle seat person is stuck in the middle. So give the middle person a break and let that person be the decision maker with armrests.”

If you’re in a row with only two seats, the armrest between them should be shared, as there is no undesirable middle seat in that scenario.

“Now, for a row of four seats, 1–2–3–4, passenger 2 has the armrest between 1 and 2, passenger 3 has the armrest between 3 and 4,” Smith explained. “The armrest between 2 and 3 is shared.”

There are exceptions to the armrest rules, however.

“If you are a tiny human and the person next to you is folding themselves into a yoga pose to fit in the seat, you should share the armrest, even if it is ‘yours,’” Smith said. “Yes, humans are territorial creatures and when a resource is a premium, our thoughts quickly turn to what we can claim. But what separates us from many animals is our ability to empathize and work together. If you do not need space, offer to share.”

Changing Seats

Try to be mindful of others when it comes to moving seats.

“If the door of the cabin closes and you find yourself seated in the middle seat, next to the aisle seat, and no one is claiming the window seat, move over to give your seatmate and yourself more room,” Gottsman said. “If someone is next to you and does not move, you can say: ‘It looks like we are lucky enough to have a little extra room. Would you like to move across and we can use this seat for our extra magazines and laptops?’ It’s a subtle way of saying ‘please move over.’”

Gottsman also offered advice for what to do if someone asks you to swap seats with them.

“If someone asks you to change places with them so they can be closer to their family members, and the seats are equal, take one for the team and do it,” she said. “If it’s not an equal move and you will get stuck in the middle seat, you can say, ‘I’m sorry, I am going to have to say no.’ They will move along and ask someone else to change seats next.”

Dealing With The Back Of The Seat

As previously noted, there really isn’t much space between airplane rows these days, so it’s not uncommon to feel movement at the back of your seat. Keep this in mind when you’re dealing with the seatback pocket in front of you.

“Seat pockets were designed to hold safety information, air sickness bags, and the occasional magazine,” Smith said. “They are not designed as [a] footrest. Please do not try to hook the backs of your heel into the opening, as this may cause lower back distress to the passenger whose back you are now pressing.”

She gave similar advice regarding the tray table.

“It is there for drinks, snacks, and the occasional meal. It was not designed to support your laptop, as a substitute drum set, or a drafting table. Your tray table is to hold lighter items,” Smith said.

If you do need to use the tray for your computer or iPad, be considerate of how much motion you create.

“You should not be pounding away on your laptop keys or engaging [in] any ongoing jiggling, bouncing or tapping,” Smith said. “The tray table is attached to the seat in front of you. Every movement of your tray table causes additional, and usually unwanted, movement of that seat and should be avoided whenever possible.”

On the flip side, try to be polite to the passengers behind you if you need to ask them to ease up on their disturbance.

“Avoid glares and sighs when a child starts to cry or accidentally kicks the back of your seat,” Gottsman said. “If someone kicks the back of your seat consistently, you can turn around and ask if they wouldn’t mind being a bit more careful, saying something like ‘I know we are in tight quarters, unfortunately I can’t seem to move my seat forward’ with a smile on your face. They will get the message.”

She also urged passengers to speak to the parents, not the child, in these situations.

“In a pleasant but controlled voice, try saying: ‘I know it must be hard to keep those little legs still for so many hours. Would you kindly keep an eye out, because I am trying to work/sleep/meditate/watch a movie and keep getting distracted. Thank you so much,’” Gottsman advised.

Getting Up During The Flight

Naturally, there are times during a flight when passengers need to get up to use the bathroom or take a stretch break. Be respectful of your neighbors during these moments.

“Do not climb over someone without their expressed permission,” Smith said. “Those in the aisle seat should be allowed to rise and enter the aisle so that you can easily access your seat.”

Patricia Rossi, a civility expert and author of “Everyday Etiquette,” urged passengers to minimize time in the bathroom when possible.

“Do your business in the airport,” she said. “That bathroom on the plane is not a day spa, so don’t keep everyone waiting.”

And when you do get out of your seat, don’t treat the plane like your home ― it’s a shared space filled with other people.

“When it comes to airplane etiquette, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you necessarily should,” Leighton said. “Walking around barefoot is certainly something you can do on airplane, but should you?”

General Attitude While Flying

“I worked in the airline industry for over 15 years, so I’m no stranger to rude passenger behavior,” Mitchell said. “Since the advent of COVID-19, rude behavior, in general, has escalated and the airline industry has had to respond to some outlandish behavior to protect the life of passengers and crew alike.”

To help promote a peaceful and civil atmosphere, she urged air travelers to pay attention to the little ways they can show respect for their crew and fellow passengers ― whether it’s using a polite tone when speaking or cutting down on alcohol intake.

In an age where it’s said that houseplants are the new pets and pets are the new kids, it makes sense that traveling with dogs has been on an uptick in recent years. More and more vacation accommodations — from short-term rentals to large hotel chains and boutiques — have embraced a pet-friendly philosophy, even coming up with amenities specifically geared toward babying your furbaby.

This rising trend has been a game-changer for grateful pet owners, and one that we need to protect through good behavior to ensure that we don’t lose the privilege. But because this is a style of travel that is still on the rise and in development, there isn’t really an established etiquette on how to be a responsible pet parent on the road.

So HuffPost spoke with hotel leadership to find out some of the biggest faux “paws” you’ll want to put a pause on when staying at a pet-friendly property, and myths they were more than ready to bust.

1. Pet Fees Aren’t Arbitrary Money Grabs

“A one-time, nonrefundable pet fee is standard in the industry,” said James Green III, general manager for Trilith Guesthouse, a popular movie studio-adjacent boutique hotel in Fayetteville, Georgia. “Preparing a room that previously accommodated a pet requires more time and resources to ensure it’s pristine for the next guest,” he explained, especially since the next occupant may have sensitivity to pet dander and hair. This can include pet hair removal, deep cleaning in case of accidents, and potential damage repair, added Olivia Williams, director of culture and guest experience at the Thompson Savannah.

“Depending on the hotel’s policies and required services, this fee typically ranges from $50 to $250,” and is directly applied to additional cleaning protocols, Green added. Plus, it can also include unspoken amenities for your pet, such as at The Bolling Wilson Hotel in Wytheville, Virginia, whose general manager Shannon Roberts-Magenheimer told us includes a pet basket with a doggie bowl, treats, extra sheets, a floor mat and more.

The sliding scale varies by specific property and may even vary by stay, such as at the Forth Hotel in Atlanta, where the rate is reduced for longer stays, making it oftentimes less costly than boarding your dog or hiring a dogsitter. Even better, some hotels even waive the pet fee. For example, all Kimpton hotels welcome dogs at no additional charge, and certain Aloft properties, such as Aloft Greenville Downtown, opt to eat the costs in order to welcome more four-legged guests to their dog-friendly city.

But whatever you do, don’t sneak Sparky in. While it may be tempting, there are important reasons to declare your dog beyond post-stay deep cleaning. For instance, at the Kimpton Hotel Palomar Philadelphia, there are designated pet-friendly floors they’ll book you in, “which help us tailor both the guest experience and our housekeeping routines,” said Ryan Sullivan, its director of sales and marketing, as well as assure safety for those guests who may have allergies. This can also include using pet-safe cleaning supplies before their stay. Another safety measure is making sure the staff has the most accurate contact information for you in case of emergency, Green points out, as well as to ensure that in case anything happens, your dog is on their radar.

Plus, not telling the team in advance takes away their opportunity to make your dog feel comfortable right away and excited about their stay. Sullivan said, “Our team lights up when a pup trots through the lobby or a cat peeks out of a carrier. We’ve even been known to write pets’ names on welcome boards or send up a surprise treat just because!”

2. Don’t Be Shy About Advocating For Amenities

Obviously, hotel staff gets a kick out of spoiling your pup, but did you know that many provide upgrades and special services for their stay? This can mean anything from having water bowls in the room, a surprise stuffy, or having goodie bags and treats at the ready. For example, at Hotel Clermont in Atlanta, they offer complimentary locally made biscuits at the front desk and winter canine coats on loan at the Kimpton Hotel in Salt Lake City. The Ritz-Carlton Oconee provides a kit with an RC-branded collapsible water bowl, tennis ball, poo bags and more at check-in, while Valhalla Resort Hotel in Helen, Georgia, sets the room up in advance with the same.

Also free: enthusiastic recommendations. At the Kimpton Palomar Philadelphia, these are “curated by our in-house expert and director of pet relations, Theodore — a very distinguished pup with excellent taste,” Sullivan assured us. On a more serious note, he said, “For those needing pet sitting or walking services, we’ve got reliable referrals on hand, plus complimentary access to Wag! Premium during your stay,” which offers discounts on services.

The most dog-friendly properties will even offer add-ons, from special dog menus for room service to entire packages, like the Kimpton Shane Hotel in Atlanta’s Pampered Pooch package, which includes a room with a view, a plush sleep round, a charcuterie board, pet robe, a dog-walking map, and exclusive special offers from local partners, including dog walkers and premium pet food brands.

So always sniff around for extra perks for your dog!

3. Know That Your Pet Affects Housekeeping Protocols

As mentioned, the service schedule of your accommodations is directly impacted by the presence of your bestie, which is why it’s important to not only disclose your dog’s presence, but also temper your expectations for the regularity with which your room will be straightened up. Some hotels have a strict policy of not entering or cleaning rooms when the pet is left unattended. This is for safety — the last thing you want is your dog to run into the hall and amok on the property or to become frightened and injure an unfortunate vacuum-wielder.

LPETTET via Getty Images Most hotels don't want your dog in the pool, so check the rules before you indulge.

However, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the luxury of crisply tucked sheets and fresh towels while vacationing with your pup. “Guests are always welcome to coordinate a specific time with the front desk so they can take their pet out during service — we’re all about flexibility,” Sullivan said. “And if housekeeping is needed while the pet is in the room, we just ask that they’re safely crated so our team can clean comfortably and safely,” he added, because while for most hotels crates are not required for stays, it’s something to consider if you want regular housekeeping without having to be present or having to coordinate with the front desk.

4. Just Because You’re On Vacation Doesn’t Mean Everyday Rules Don’t Apply

It’s easy to forget pup parent responsibilities when in a high-service vacation mode, but we have to remember that our getaway is in someone else’s backyard and their city ordinances still demand respect.

Generally, outdoor patios or spaces are the most accommodating to pets, but Shaina Ovide, front office manager for Kimpton Palomar South Beach, said, “This can vary by property and local regulations, but generally, pets are not allowed in indoor food service areas, even if it’s counter-serve” due to health codes. Green reminds us, “Only certified service animals are permitted inside certain outlets,” and Nicole Swinson, Aloft Greenville Downtown senior sales manager, added, “Even though a pet might be a service animal, they are traditionally not allowed in gym or pool deck spaces in hotels.”

It’s also frowned upon to allow your dog on the furniture in public spaces, as other guests might be allergic or uncomfortable sharing seating with your buddy.

No matter where in the hotel and town your dog is exploring, it’s also crucial to keep them leashed. Not only does this ensure that your pup doesn’t get lost, but as Roberts-Magenheimer points out, it reduces danger to other guests and their pets as well; just because your pooch is friendly doesn’t mean other guests — two-legged or four — are.

“Additionally, it’s important for owners to clean up after their pets,” Green said. Pet-friendly hotels typically offer amenities like poop stations with free waste bags and are delighted when you make use of them. Scooping the poop ensures cleanliness on the grounds, preserves integrity of the landscaping, and helps to keep the property a haven for all visitors.

5. Honor Your Anxious Pup

While some dogs are suited to a life on the road, others are more comfortable in familiar settings, and it’s ultimately up to the pet parent to know which category their furbaby belongs in. If your dog has feelings that are too big to handle staying calm around other dogs — like when dining outside — or remaining in the room by themselves, be sure to respect that.

A helpful tip Ovide shares is, although “crates or carriers are not required, we do recommend them for pets who feel more secure in enclosed spaces. They can be helpful, especially when pets are adjusting to a new environment like a hotel room.” Crating can help prevent stress- or boredom-induced damage to furniture, curtains, bedding and floors while unsupervised that you might be stuck footing the bill for.

Keeping them in the room alone can also potentially disturb other guests if they’re prone to barking or crying when lonely or stressed, Swinson points out. Sullivan offers this advice: “Bring your go-to pet supplies! We’ve got the essentials covered, but nothing beats their favorite toy or blanket from home to make them feel like the VIP they are.”

No matter what, though, if you’re staying at a dogs-welcome hotel, remember that “We love hosting pets … we aim to make every guest — two-legged or four-legged — feel welcome!” Ovide said. Remember that these guidelines are in place as part of the extra steps they take to ensure your dog’s comfort and safety, and enrich the experience of all so that we can keep this trend of pet-friendly travel going.",Science

When I was four years old, my dad’s job transferred him north, so he and my mom moved our family to Canada for six years. While living there, they decided that we should all become Canadian citizens. I don’t know what compelled my parents to go through the process of gaining citizenship for all of us in a country we didn’t plan to live in very long, but I’m glad they did. Through the years, it’s always felt like a safety net for me, especially as anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment here in the United States has increased.

Last summer, as the presidential election loomed, my wife and I talked frequently about what it would look like if we decided to take our two kids and leave the country. We understood, and still do, that we’re “protected” here in New York, but when you’re an LGBTQ+ family, it doesn’t matter where you live, or how safe you feel: You must always have a plan.

After Nov. 5, my plan was to cry. All the time. But I had to make dinner for my kids and do the laundry. I also had a deadline for an article I was writing, and I needed to get in touch with my sources.

I have a professional acquaintance in the Midwest who, like me, is queer, married, and raising two kids. I had an unusually difficult time getting her on the phone for our early November interview. “I know this is a challenging time,” I texted, “just let me know when you’re free.” When I finally did get to speak with her, she confessed why she’d been so busy. It wasn’t simply the exhausting aftermath of an election that devastated much of the queer community; she and her trans husband were moving their family abroad.

I was impressed. I don’t know a single person in my queer community who hadn’t considered their own exit strategy in the wake of a Trump administration. I also didn’t know anyone who was actually going through with it. Gina, who requested to withhold her last name for her family’s safety, told me, “I don’t want to live here feeling angry and hurt. It’s not good for my mental well-being, feeling betrayed by people everywhere I go.”

Gina and her husband put their house on the market immediately following the election, and it sold right away. Then, they had to face the harsh logistics of moving their family abroad. She told me that the planning was difficult, but that staying would be worse.

“It’s hard just to be in public. I look around and I think, half of the people in this room voted to hurt us, and did that because they are either ignorant, or they hate us,” she said.

Leaving the place they call home is emotional for Gina and her family, but she wants to keep them safe. “If we live somewhere where our rights are protected at a federal level, that might feel like a relief,” she added.

The logistics of moving abroad

Gina introduced me to Jess Drucker, founder of Rainbow Relocation, a nationwide organization founded to “empower queer folks and their families to move, live, and thrive aboard.” Drucker told me that previously, she worked with individuals and families who were looking for an adventure abroad. In November, she was inundated with requests for help.

“The increase is definitely threat-based and fear-based,” she said.

Drucker is also working more than ever with trans people, she told me. “That’s the group that feels the most under threat and has the most rush on their paperwork for gender markers, gender identity and passports. That’s much more complex,” she said.

I inquired about which countries people were looking into, and Drucker confessed, “I’m a bit of a dream-killer.”

“People are looking at the world as a buffet of country options,” she told me, but what they actually need to consider is their own value. If you’re wealthy, you might consider a European Golden Visa, which offers foreign investors a temporary residence permit if they maintain an investment – usually real estate – within the country. Some nations offer temporary residence to highly skilled migrants, which are foreigners with advanced degrees or specialized professions who will bring their skills to the nation’s workforce.

“If you don’t offer professional value, you can still offer something to economically insecure countries,” Drucker explained. There are volunteer opportunities in countries that are queer and trans friendly, like Nicaragua or Bolivia.

She was also clear that it is extremely difficult for LGBTQ+ Americans to seek asylum.

“Going [abroad] and hoping to get asylum status comes at great financial peril should that claim get rejected and you have to move back to the US,” she said. “If you are going to move your life — a costly endeavor, of course — you might as well become as informed as possible how to do that with intention, on visas that you can qualify for, in countries that are safe.”

Many are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach

Mike Garda, a New York-based therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, told me that initially, he had many conversations with his patients about moving. “I’ve observed a pretty steep decline in discussions about leaving the country, as folks have had more time to process, receive community care, and at times confront the reality of how difficult it would be to move abroad,” he said.

Once the initial shock had worn off, Garda was able to shift conversations to what was within his clients’ control. “I helped many of my clients identify things they felt were possible to complete promptly and preemptively, such as name changes, gender marker designations and renewing passports,” he said. “I don’t think these conversations are over, and I expect that as we see new legislation roll out, folks will continue to mourn and look for a way to escape the pain of being marginalized and systematically oppressed.”

Even Garda admitted that he had considered leaving, but ultimately he didn’t feel it would be right. “I think it would be incredibly privileged to move to Europe and continue to work virtually with clients who are unable to exert the same mobility. I think this is a time for queer resistance whether that is through activism, coalition-building [or] simply existing as we are,” he said.

For many in the queer community, we will simply have to wait and see what happens. “I would love to be wrong,” Gina told me. “I would love to end up looking foolish for going abroad with our children for a couple of months or years. Wouldn’t that be the best-case scenario?”

If you, like Gina, do decide it’s time to go, Drucker is ready to help. For people who can’t afford her fees, her Facebook group Queer Expats is a great place to connect and find helpful resources. The group’s membership grew by the thousands in the days following the election. “If a whole community is feeling scared, then we need to take it pretty seriously,” she said.

For now, my family is staying put and turning to our community for strength. I can’t imagine leaving my loved ones, even as I mourn the future that I wanted for my children and the rights we stand to lose. Every LGBTQ+ American is faced with a choice right now about how to stay safe, how to move forward and how best to embody our own queer resistance. It’s okay if that resistance looks like a relocation abroad, engaging in activism or just simply existing as usual and living our everyday lives. My dual citizenship is a safety net I feel lucky to have, but my hope is that — for now — I won’t have to use it.",World

When I was offered an exciting “dream” job working in the dean’s office of a medical school in New York City a few years ago, it posed a challenge. This would be an opportunity for me to live my values, really make a difference and also meet a long-held dream of living in New York. I wanted to say “yes.” But my wife, Pat, and I lived in New Hampshire, and I needed to have some long talks with her before I made a move.

We’d been practicing “intentional” decision-making for 30 years, and this decision was going to be a tough one. On one hand, our kids were grown and out of the house, the med school I had been working for was in a bit of turmoil, and I was ready for a change. On the other hand, Pat loved her job and her garden and had no desire to move. I proposed a plan that I buy a hybrid car, return home every weekend to help with house and dog chores, and call every day.

Advertisement

“Darling, I’d really like to try this, 80-20,” I told Pat. “I’m excited but frightened. 80-20.”

We talked it over for days.

“I’m in favor, too,” Pat eventually told me, “55-45. I’m nervous, too, but you should go for it. 55-45.”

Done. The decision was made. But what just happened?

Our numerical negotiation routine started when we first began dating. We were both interns in a family medicine residency in upstate New York, working about 80 hours a week, and on call every third night. Two weeks after Pat and I began to go out, we had a rare free evening and had to decide between eating Mexican or Chinese food. We had heard good things about the Mexican restaurant, but we also enjoyed the Chinese joint where we had our first date.

This question — where to eat? — quickly turned into a meta-question: How do the two of us decide where to eat? If we chose to deliberate, we knew that each would try to please the other, to figure out which restaurant the other person favored. We were aware that the initial steps in a relationship are important, and we were both committed to equity and equality. This decision, then — Mexican or Chinese — became a touchstone and metaphor for us. How could each of us express what our preference was without stepping on — or simply influencing — the other?

Pat suggested that we each independently decide which restaurant we preferred, and then compare our choices. We had to agree to be honest and stick to our choice. “But wait,” she reflected, “that won’t work. What if I say Chinese and you say Mexican? Then all we have is conflict, not a decision.”

We pondered this for a few seconds, and then — since we were both comfortable with numbers and quantitative thinking — I proposed that we add a weighting to our preference. If Pat preferred Chinese because she really wanted to reinforce those “first date” pheromones, it would be a lot stronger than if she just wanted to check out their moo shu chicken. Similarly, she couldn’t know if I wanted to go to Mexican just for a change of pace, or if I had secretly arranged for a special mole sauce for the enchiladas.

“Let’s do it this way,” I proposed. “Not only do we each have to quietly commit to our preference, but we have to say how strongly we feel about that choice.”

We agreed to use a scale of 0 to 100. Preferring a choice 60-40 would be a modest preference for the former choice over the latter, 90-10 would be a very strong preference, and 50-50 would mean an honest “I truly don’t have preference” between the two options.

Then — as if playing rock-paper-scissors — we each would state our preference and weighting. The restaurant that had the higher combined weighting would win our business. It was simple!

So, just as our relationship was beginning, we decided we would each have to be honest about our own preferences and needs. In this case, Chinese won. I like noodles and she likes eggplant!

Clearly stating our preferences — and especially the meaning of a 50-50 — had another important resonance beyond suggesting that either choice would be OK: 50-50 indicated the equality we sought. Both of us identify as feminists and came up strong in anti-war and civil rights movements, and we felt moral injury if the wishes of one of us would systematically hold sway over the other. So, with a smile, we’d say “five-oh-five-oh” as a mantra to renew the commitment to our ideals.

A problem that soon arose was that we could each feel more strongly than the other about different small things. I prefer to wash dishes. Pat prefers to brush the dogs. I prefer to do mechanical repairs, and she prefers to iron and sew. The fact that some of these preferences fell along traditional gender expectations was an irony that we appreciated. But the thoughtful and explicit balance of those household chores was a potential fork in the road.

We saw other couples implicitly divide up the responsibilities, just as they implicitly made the decisions about what to have for dinner. We also saw other couples begin to drift apart, and we figured out that under that drift was, actually, resentment.

Resentment can build from one person seeming to get their way more than the other. It can lead to feeling that you are owed something in the relationship. If a partner doesn’t get what is owed, that may be what triggers the drift. Since we were both in favor of clear communication — as family doctors, we specialized in listening — we decided that resentment about what was unfair or unsaid could be averted by being up front and explicit all of the time.

Well, OK, most of the time.

When Pat came home from her 36-hour shift completely exhausted — both physically and emotionally — I knew to greet her with a hug and a cup of tea, and not remind her that she had agreed to not leave her knitting projects on the dining room table and the hall table. I’d raise that later. But it would be important to let her know at some point soon. Otherwise, my tendency to obsessively tidy our surfaces would bother both of us and lead her to resent my putting her piles away as much as I resented her making those piles.

So we began to use the 0-to-100 scale to describe how much we liked or disliked various behaviors as well as choices. If her piles were only upsetting me 55-45, I could live with them. If they were really bothering me, it’d be 80-20, and I’d have to find a way to say something. It was my job, not hers, to know how I felt and to express it clearly. And if I procrastinated in fulfilling my promise to fix the tangle of computer and television cords in the living room — and this made her gnash her teeth every time she passed through — she’d point at it and quietly say “70-30.” Then I would bump that chore up to the top of my to-do list.

Although household duties and dinner preferences were just the small things, we — then and now — try to end each week with a pretty reasonable balance. We each get what we want about 50% of the time. And if things begin to feel out of balance — if I begin to feel that Pat is “winning” more than I am — well, whose fault is that? If she is 70-30 a lot and gets her preference, maybe it means that I need to be clearer and more certain. Maybe I need to be 75-25 rather than 60-40. If I do not get what I want, it is my fault, not hers. And if we are both escalating our preferences to 80-20 and 90-10, maybe there are some real problems. To cover that eventuality, we agreed to go see a therapist if necessary, and we did have to do that once.

The system works most handily with quick decisions — which couch to buy, which charity to support, when to give up on a long line at the coffee shop. The test of the technique came with the big decisions. With the passing years we had to decide when and where to vacation, buy a larger home, get married, move, have children, move again.

As the stakes became higher, the need for clarity and honesty also grew, and it was useful to have our numerical system to help us. Pat felt very strongly that our “forever” home should have places for her to garden (“80-20”), and this desire readily outweighed my desire to not have a lot of lawn to mow (“60-40”).

How would we know without a language? We love each other, but neither of us is a mind reader. Love does not mean precisely knowing what the other person wants or needs at all times. It means respecting the other person to fully honor their wants and needs without sacrificing our own. And it sometimes means asking.

Some of the big things were tougher to rectify, and the numerical system did not always magically work or feel appropriate. If one of us enjoyed sex more than the other — and, yes, that happened — the decision about when, where and how became a bit tougher. If she comes into the bedroom with a spring in her step and a little grin on her face, I might think that the odds of a good night were pretty high. At that moment I am not going to whisper steamily into her ear, “Yeah, honey, 90-10 to go ahead, how about you?” And making decisions about raising our children required consensus more than instant resolution.

Now, as we age, as our bodies grow slacker and slower, and our minds are not as sharp, we have to be even kinder with each other, so there are fewer instances of 90-10. And even though “five-oh-five-oh” remains a central theme of our marriage, we still are careful to be honest when we truly have a preference.

Did that tough decision — the dream job — work out? Yes! Without explicitly sharing our values, I might have held back from exploring what turned out to be a wonderful experience. Can other people use our system? Sure. Our kids — neither in medicine, by the way — have told us that they and their spouses use our number system on occasion, but maybe not as relentlessly as we do. Their strong and resilient relationships have their own checks and balances. Love, after all, is — at its best — qualitative, not quantitative.

If you’re guilty of putting too much thought into how many exclamation points you include in your work emails, you’re hardly alone.

On TikTok and Instagram, a number of women are imagining what might happen if they threw out the niceties and started writing emails like a man.

“It’s 2024 - no more courtesy phrases, babes,” Kay Bray, a career coach, jokes in one viral clip that has over 210,000 views on TikTok. Reworking her email in the clip, she takes out the “No rush — just looking to stay in the loop,” and opts not to include the obligatory “Thanks so much!”

Maedeh Davami, a sixth year medical student, also made an “emailing like a man” TikTok video which went viral.

“I created the video because, honestly, we’ve all been there,” she told HuffPost.

“You know, rewriting an email five times just to make sure you sound ‘polite enough’ but not overly enthusiastic like you’re writing to your grandma.”

Davami’s biggest “you’re doing too much” tendency? “Definitely writing ‘no worries’ when clearly there were some worries involved.”

Kristel Cocoli, a software developer and tech content creator, created a similar video back in 2022.

“I’ve noticed how overly polite and padded my emails could get, especially compared to the short, straight-to-the-point emails I get from my colleagues and collaborators,” she told HuffPost. “I thought, ‘What if I just edited out all the fluff and sounded more like them?’”

The video was “a lighthearted experiment to see how it’d feel if I ditched the exclamation points and endless ‘no worries!’ vibes.”

Advertisement

The videos are all in good fun, but what isn’t fun is how women are unfairly judged for writing emails that are viewed as overly congenial.

A study published in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication in 2006 found that “when elements of speech and writing are associated with female communication style, they tend to be described in negative terms.”

For instance, the researchers wrote, exclamation points, which tend to be used more by women than men in emails and texts, are seen as ’’markers of excitability:” a phrase that “implies instability and emotional randomness.”

As unfair as it is, “There are different rules for men and women when it comes to any workplace interaction,” said Lois Frankel, the author of “Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office” and an executive coach of three decades.

“Whereas a guy can use two lines and get away with it, in our society we expect women — even self-confident, assertive women — to round off the rough edges just a little or risk being put in the ‘bitchy’ category,” she said.

That said, the goal is not to write more like a man, she said, but to be more confident and get to the point so you’re not wasting your own time. Frankel’s recommendation is skip the fluff and instead start with a quick personal touch, give the reason you’re writing, and then no more than three to four sentences of bullet points.

Her example email?

Doug, I hope you had a productive trip to Dallas. I wanted to touch base about the proposal we discussed earlier this month which you said you’d have to me no later than this morning. I haven’t seen it and need it by EOD today so that I can complete the analysis on time. I appreciate your making it a priority and getting it to me by then. Regards, Judith

Marnie Lemonik, a career coach in Austin, Texas, thinks sometimes women add niceties out of fear of coming across as too demanding. She reminds her clients that you’re not annoying or “asking for too much” by simply trying to fulfill the duties of your role.

“And actually, the shorter the email, the easier you make it for the receiver of the email to actually take action upon the request,” she told HuffPost. “By making your request more simple, the core of what is actually needed can shine through more clearly.”

Of course, you don’t have to forgo all friendlessness, reminds Cocoli, one of the women behind a viral TikTok video above.

Far-right influencers are calling on Donald Trump’s supporters to boycott Walmart after one of the company’s heirs took out a full-page ad in The New York Times last Sunday promoting the “No Kings” protests planned for the day of Trump’s military parade this weekend.

The ad purchased by Christy Walton, 76, who inherited a 1.9% stake in Walmart from her late husband John Walton and is one of the richest women in the United States, encouraged Trump critics to mobilize against the president’s costly military parade scheduled for Saturday, Forbes reported. It’s similar to another ad she paid for in the Times back in March.

“The honor, dignity, and integrity of our country are not for sale,” Sunday’s ad read.

Trump acolytes including far-right influencer Laura Loomer, White House special adviser Kari Lake and Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna all attacked Walton over the ad.

“Looks like the Walmart dynasty is big mad about China Tariffs,” Luna wrote.

Walmart Chief Financial Officer David Rainey warned investors in an interview with CNBC last month that shoppers will likely see higher prices toward the end of May and in June because of Trump’s tariffs.

A spokesperson for Walmart told HuffPost, “the advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,” noting that “she does not serve on the board or play any role in decision making at Walmart.”

“We condemn violence, including when it’s directed towards law enforcement, and the damaging of property,” the spokesperson said before referring to the ongoing protests in LA, where Trump called in the National Guard. “As a company with associates and customers in the Los Angeles region, we remain focused on their safety and that of impacted communities. “

Nonetheless, the far-right account Libs of Chicago and other users with high followings lashed out at Walmart on X, calling for a boycott of the retail chain.

“Sort of ironic isn’t it? A Walton married a socialist,” Libs of Chicago wrote. “If there was ever a time to boycott Walmart, it’s now.”

One of the ppl funding the socialist movement is Christy Ruth Walton who is a stake holder of @Walmart.

A representative for Walton sent HuffPost a statement saying the ad was a “personal” message from her meant to people encourage to “engage peacefully and civically” during the Saturday protests, and was unrelated to anti-ICE protests unfolding in Los Angeles.

Walton has “provided no funding to organizations or individuals involved in the demonstrations in Los Angeles or other cities, nor has she provided any funding to those organizing the upcoming events,” the statement said.

“Her interest is simply in encouraging people to listen to one another, participate in their communities, and productively engage on the issues they care about,” the statement continued. “She believes while we have the right to protest, we do not have a right to violence. She condemns violence in all forms and her message promotes civic engagement, peaceful dialogue, and the sharing of diverse views and voices.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt verbally slapped down a reporter for asking whether President Donald Trump would allow peaceful protests during Saturday’s military parade.

On Tuesday, Trump ramped up his language about demonstrators, warning that anyone who protests at his long-awaited event marking the Army’s 250th birthday will be met with “very heavy force.”

So, it was perhaps to be expected that a correspondent would question Leavitt about the president’s remarks at Wednesday’s White House media briefing.

NOTUS White House correspondent Jasmine Wright asked for a clarification on “what kind of protest President Trump does support or find acceptable?”

Leavitt replied that the president “absolutely supports peaceful protests. He supports the First Amendment.”

Advertisement

“He supports the right of Americans to make their voices heard,” she continued. “He does not support violence of any kind. He does not support assaulting law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their job. It’s very clear for the president what he supports and what he does not.”

Wright again sought clarity, asking: “So if there were peaceful protests on Saturday for the military parade, President Trump would allow that?”

Leavitt then gave the reporter short shrift.

“Of course, the president supports peaceful protests,” Leavitt told Wright. “What a stupid question.”

The $45 million parade in Washington, D.C. — which falls on the president’s birthday — is expected to feature a display of military hardware and thousands of soldiers.

Amid nationwide protests against immigration enforcement raids, Trump issued a warning from the Oval Office on Tuesday.

“If there’s any protest that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force, by the way. And for those people that want to protest, they’re gonna be met with very big force,” the president said.

“And I haven’t even heard about a protest — but you know, this is people that hate our country,” he continued. “But they will be met with very heavy force.”

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are at the “only speaking through friends” part of their breakup.

Vice President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles spoke with Musk on the phone last Friday, after which Musk agreed to walk back some of the more explosive claims he made last week, when he and Trump spent the afternoon feuding online.

Sources familiar with the call confirmed to both CNN and The Wall Street Journal that it was intended to de-escalate tensions between the two parties.

On Monday, the tech billionaire dutifully tucked his tail between his legs and published an apology of sorts.

“I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week,” Musk wrote on social media. “They went too far.”

Advertisement

That’s a strikingly different tone than the combative one he adopted last week, when, in a series of escalating social media posts, Musk attacked the president’s signature piece of legislation for growing the deficit by $2.4 trillion; called for Trump’s impeachment; mulled over starting his own political party; and said the reason the Jeffrey Epstein files haven’t been released is because Trump is in them.

Epstein, a wealthy financier, died in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges in 2019.

“Mark this post for the future,” Musk said in a follow-up to the Epstein charge. “The truth will come out.”

Musk has since deleted the post.

While the former “first buddies” appear to have patched things up a bit, a full rapprochement likely remains out of the question.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will start “phasing out” the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the end of this hurricane season and reduce the amount of federal money that’s given towards disaster relief in the future.

“The FEMA thing has not been a very successful experiment. Very, very expensive and it doesn’t get the job done,” he told reporters from the White House while criticizing the agency’s recent handling of Hurricane Helene, which caused $78.7 billion worth of damage in six states, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Any federal disaster aid will instead come directly from the White House. Exactly who will handle this is not yet certain, he said.

Trump has repeatedly said that states should bear their own recovery costs, and in March he signed an executive order that directs state and local governments to “play a more active and significant role” in preparing for disasters.

“If a certain state, as an example, gets hit by a hurricane or tornado … the governor should be able to handle it. And frankly, if they can’t handle the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor,” Trump said Tuesday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, echoed Trump’s remarks during the press conference, saying removing the agency will “empower governors to go out and respond to emergency situations.”

“People are responsible to respond to their own people closest to home,” she said.

The hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. NOAA has predicted a 60% chance of above-normal hurricane activity.

Local and state governments are already in charge of handling their own natural disasters. FEMA steps in to offer help and reimburse communities for disaster response and recovery projects if it’s requested.

“The locals are in charge of their county and their situation and the state of North Carolina advises FEMA on what we need,” Justin Graney, chief of external affairs for North Carolina Emergency Management, told NPR back in March.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose state has experienced four of the nation’s top seven costliest hurricanes, has similarly criticized FEMA’s recent hurricane response, calling its processes too bureaucratic. He expressed indifference on Trump dismantling the agency when questioned by reporters late last month.

“On the core prep, response and then stabilize and get people back to normal, just know that we’ve never relied on FEMA for any of that here in the state of Florida,” he said.

Recent FEMA grants to the state have included over $1 billion given after Hurricane Ian in 2022.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein (D), whose state continues to recover following Hurricane Helene’s devastating hit last fall, has voiced the opposite while urging the agency to be “fixed” rather than destroyed.

“The Governor has been clear on this: Eliminating FEMA would be a man-made disaster; we need FEMA to help us address natural disasters. Let’s work together to improve FEMA so we are ready for future disasters,” a spokesperson for his office told HuffPost on Wednesday.

The amount of money doled out by FEMA has significantly risen over the last decade, but this has been partially blamed on the rising number of catastrophic storms.

Within the last 20 years, the U.S. has experienced its top five costliest storms on record. Hurricane Helene, which ranks seventh in terms of cost, caused $78.7 billion worth of damage in six states, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

The federal government’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which provides FEMA with its funding, has reported its annual spending more than tripling in the years since 2005, when hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma resulted in record aid spending. Prior to 2005, the DRF’s spending averaged about $5 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

High school senior Kyle has visited Chicago three times over the last two years. The 17-year-old has grown to love the Windy City, the birthplace of one of his favorite indie rock bands, Fall Out Boy. He plans to apply to a prestigious arts college there this fall.

But the New Orleans teen and his family didn’t make these journeys for fun. Chicago was one of the only places where Kyle could continue to access testosterone, part of the gender-affirming care he needed to alleviate his intense feelings of gender dysphoria, after his home state of Louisiana’s ban on care went into effect in January 2024.

Advertisement

“I describe it as getting caught up with other boys my age,” Kyle told HuffPost about taking testosterone. He’s enjoyed hearing his voice deepen and watching his face become more square.

Kyle considers himself lucky as one of the few trans kids in his community that is able to continue accessing care by traveling out of state. He was able to get a $500 grant from the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, to make the trips more manageable. Without financial resources or family support, the vast majority of his trans friends are instead forced to wait until they’re adults to start the process of medically transitioning.

HuffPost spoke with three families of transgender youth — all of whom requested to use pseudonyms or to use first names to protect their privacy — who shared stories underscoring the lengths to which they’ve gone and the distances they’ve traveled in order to access gender-affirming care for their children in the aftermath of a tidal wave of state-level bans on this care.

They may have to continue traveling farther and farther to continue care. Future access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth is now in the hands of the Supreme Court, which is set to issue a ruling this month to decide whether state-level bans on minors are a form of sex discrimination and violate the Constitution.

Currently, more than a third of transgender youth age 13 to 17 live across the 26 states that have passed some form of a ban on gender-affirming care, according to a 2024 report from the Williams Institute.

The case before the highest court, United States v. Skrmetti, involves Tennessee law SB 1, which bars the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for the purpose of gender transition and instead encourages minors to “appreciate their sex” assigned at birth.

The outcome in Skrmetti rests largely on what level of judicial scrutiny, or official skepticism, the justices require Tennessee’s law to be examined under. If the court rules that Tennessee has to apply heightened scrutiny — a more rigorous review given to laws around gender discrimination — the state is more likely to lose. In that case, the courts either could flat-out rule the law is unconstitutional, or more possibly, send the case back down to a lower court for reconsideration.

If, however, the Court sides with Tennessee and allows for rational basis — a review typically reserved for economic regulations and not classifications of race, gender or national origin — this means that state’s ban would remain in effect. Experts worry that could make it more difficult for trans legal advocates to challenge other state bans on gender-affirming care for minors and adults. If the court sides with Tennessee, they say this could open up broader implications for other arenas of legal rights to privacy.

Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University, said that Skrmetti is one of several cases on the subject of rights to privacy and bodily autonomy, which have been under attack in recent decades. He thinks about the fight to uphold transgender rights as having separate but overlapping interests with rights to abortion, marriage equality, family formation and parental rights.

“When you start taking that bundle of sticks, that bundle of rights and you remove one and then maybe chop off another, suddenly that entire bundle is a little less stable,” Kreis said.

During oral arguments on Tennessee’s ban in December, the conservative justices seemed skeptical of trans legal advocates’ arguments that SB 1 violates the Constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, asked at one point if it was best to leave bans on care up to the “democratic process,” seemingly suggesting that the issue should be determined by state law — as is now the case with reproductive health care.

Advertisement

Many legal experts have begun to imagine what the landscape could look like in the event that the court upholds Tennessee’s ban.

“A loss in Skrmetti would give some wind in the sails of conservatives who are trying to chip away at Bostock,” Kreis said, referring to the landmark Supreme Court case which protected employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In Project 2025, conservative advocates signaled their desire to restrict the application of the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in Bostock to advance transgender rights — and so far at least one conservative Texas judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, has worked to minimize its impact.

The possibility of the Supreme Court upholding Tennessee’s ban especially worries families of trans youth within the state.

In Nashville, Diane has worked hard to create an affirming childhood for her soon-to-be-14-year-old trans daughter, Lily. She enrolled her in a trans support group, let her pick out her favorite skirts, and has given her space and encouragement as she figures out the kind of girl she wants to be. After Lily told her parents she was trans at age 11, by cc’ing her parents on an email declaring she used she/her pronouns, Diane quickly saw her daughter shed an “invisible weight.”

But in 2022, the state passed its ban on care for trans youth. Many providers in Nashville abruptly stopped seeing patients before the law even went into effect — and later halted care for cisgender youth that could be seen as “pathways to gender affirmation,” one doctor told HuffPost. Diane’s family began to consider out-of-state options within a few hours’ driving distance of their home, and landed on a children’s hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. They visited the hospital three times over the course of nine months, speaking with therapists, social workers and doctors.

Advertisement

On the last trip, Lily received a hormone blocker insert into her arm to delay the effects of her natal puberty until she turned 14. That same day, Ohio’s Republican legislature overturned a veto from Gov. Mike DeWine, banning gender-affirming care for youth in the state.

Now the family travels to a clinic in Washington, D.C., where they’ve been twice already to establish care — and in their next visit this summer, their doctors will work with the family to determine if Lily is ready to start estrogen therapy. Their insurance doesn’t cover gender-affirming care and they’ve exhausted their airline miles. The trips are difficult for Lily, who has to miss school for these appointments, as well as for Diane, who deals with chronic fatigue from long Covid.

“The idea that I’m letting my daughter follow some whim is insulting,” Diane said. “This is not a whim, this is not a phase — this is who she is.”

Other families in the South have even had to consider traveling internationally in order to get gender-affirming care for their children.

Ana, a language professor in Birmingham, Alabama, said that she ultimately decided to travel with her son back to her home country of Spain to see a doctor that specializes in gender-affirming care after she tried, and failed, to meet with out-of-state providers that had monthslong waitlists.

“It’s like swimming against the current,” Ana said, noting that she hasn’t seen her 17-year old-son smile since January. After he first came out as transgender at 13, he was heavily bullied and ostracized by his friends.

In Spain, Ana’s son (who has dual citizenship) restarted the process of establishing his gender dysphoria diagnosis and a treatment plan from the beginning, even though he had already taken testosterone for three months prior to Alabama’s ban.

Spain allows trans teens to receive hormone therapy and puberty blockers with support of their parents, and allows anyone over 16 to legally register their gender on documents. Ana said her son plans to move to Europe after graduating high school due to the level of anti-trans legislation and rhetoric in the U.S.

“It feels like he’s going to into exile,” she said.

Over the last three years, the rising anti-trans legislation in state legislatures coupled with Trump’s slate of anti-trans executive orders has dramatically shifted the life decisions of trans youth, their families and even trans adults.

Trump has wielded executive orders to threaten to pull federal funding from hospitals that serve LGBTQ+ youth, or schools that allow trans girls to play on female sports teams. Last month, House Republicans passed a massive domestic policy package that would include provisions to bar Medicaid and Affordable Care Act plans from covering gender-affirming care for trans youth and adults alike.

The vast uncertainty of the state of transgender rights — as many legal challenges to state and federal actions make their way through the courts — has many families of LGBTQ+ people holding their breath for the Skrmetti decision. But the uncertainty could swing in multiple ways.

“[Skmretti] isn’t an end-all, be-all. If trans people lose Skrmetti, it’s not supposed to be that forever and ever more states can restrict health care for trans youth,” Ezra Young, a New York lawyer and scholar, said. “The case is very fact-specific. The Supreme Court could say there might be a subset of trans youth for which the state of Tennessee has a special interest in protecting.”

Young said the outcome of Skrmetti and the scope of the ruling entirely rests on how the justices write the decision. He likens the significance of a possible victory in Skrmetti to something like Windsor v. U.S., a 2013 case before the Supreme Court that struck down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act, barring gay and lesbian couples from obtaining certain federal tax benefits.

The Windsor victory was one case in a chorus of early victories for same-sex marriage — but it wasn’t until the court’s 2015 Obergefell decision that protected the fundamental right nationwide to same-sex marriage under the Constitution.

Similarly, the landscape of trans legal rights and representation has shifted dramatically in the last five years, and often delivered a mixed bag of results.

“It feels like we’re left on an island,” said Mariah Moore, the co-director of policy and programs at Transgender Law Center.

“Ever since the Dobbs decision, we’re seeing what happens when lifesaving care is no longer available,” she said, referring to the slate of women dying or suffering pregnancy complications after being denied access to abortion-related care in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling ending the federal right to abortion.

When Moore came out as trans in 2006, she remembers how difficult it was to access gender-affirming care, especially without health insurance.

“Black trans women opened their homes for us Black trans kids to eat, be housed, find the right doctor. That’s the type of things communities did,” she said. “I’m a beneficiary of that care and that’s what was instilled in generations of queer and trans people.”

No matter the outcome this month, Moore said, she knows this isn’t the end in the fight for trans liberation.

Jimmy Kimmel called out Fox News on Wednesday night for “misinformation” as the right-wing network covers President Donald Trump’s decision to send the military to Los Angeles in response to the ongoing protests in the city.

“There’s been so much misinformation, so much cherrypicking, when it comes to what they show on TV,” Kimmel said. “I mean, if you turn on Fox News, you’d think LA was getting invaded by more aliens than the movie ‘Mars Attacks.’ They are working so hard to make this seem like a lawless battleground.”

Kimmel films his show in LA, and asked his studio audience if they saw a “lawless battleground.”

The answer was a resounding “no.”

Kimmel said he’s been getting texts from people in other parts of the country asking if he’s OK.

“Yeah, we’re OK. The only problem we have is this lunatic,” Kimmel said, referring to Trump. “He’s acting like we’re burning the city to the ground.”

To give the situation some perspective, Kimmel showed a map of LA County and the city of Los Angeles, then showed the location of the protests, which appeared as the tiniest of dots even when zooming in.

“That’s it,” he said. “This is the emergency equivalent of having a mosquito bite on your body.”

Ye has apparently switched up his moniker yet again, nearly four years after he legally renounced his birth name, Kanye Omari West.

In business documents obtained by multiple outlets on Tuesday, the rapper was listed under the name “Ye Ye.” West’s chief financial officer, Hussain Lalani, reportedly filed the documents with the California Secretary of State.

“Ye Ye” was listed as the “manager or member” of West’s companies Yeezy Apparel, Yeezy Record Label and Ox Paha Inc. in the documents, according to E! News.

It’s unclear whether the “Power” musician, who has not publicly announced his new moniker, has filed separate documents to legally change his name again.

Ye’s representatives did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

In October 2021, a Los Angeles judge approved the 24-time Grammy winner’s petition to officially change his name to Ye after he requested the name change in August.

WASHINGTON – They snapped. They stared off into space. They zipped into Senate elevators and smiled as the doors closed with them safely inside.

This is how nearly a dozen Senate Republicans reacted Wednesday when asked the simplest question: Do you plan to attend President Donald Trump’s military parade in D.C. on Saturday, and are you comfortable with its estimated $45 million price tag?

“I won’t be here in town, but I wish I was,” lamented Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.).

Asked about the tens of millions of dollars the event is going to cost taxpayers, Fischer walked into a nearby Senate elevator and gazed into nothingness as the doors closed.

At least the Nebraska senator spoke. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) clocked in at eight seconds of silence in response to HuffPost asking the same question. With a big grin, Budd slipped into another elevator and stood there, waiting for the doors to close.

“Nope,” Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) said, fidgeting on his phone, when asked if he planned to attend. He let out a big sigh when asked about the parade’s price tag, and started talking about unrelated legislation.

“I’m focused on the trillions right now, which is the reconciliation bill,” Young said. “So I think my constituents would assess that my priorities are appropriate.”

Asked if that means he is comfortable with how much Trump’s military event will cost taxpayers, he snapped: “I answered the question.”

When HuffPost pointed out he didn’t actually answer the question, Young interrupted, “I answered the question I wanted to answer!’

Alrighty then, sir!

Saturday’s parade is being billed as a celebration of the Army’s 250th anniversary, but it’s also timed with Trump’s 79th birthday. The event will feature thousands of soldiers, 150 military vehicles and more than 50 aircraft being rolled around the streets of D.C.

Millions of people nationwide will be protesting Trump at the same time as his parade, in response to his harsh crackdown on immigration enforcement and his decision to deploy the U.S. military to Los Angeles to respond to unrest there. The “No Kings Day” protests are happening in all 50 states and in more than 1,500 cities, though not in D.C.

An obvious reason Senate Republicans don’t want to talk about the cost of this parade is that they’ve been on a tear about slashing so-called government waste since Trump took office, and a massive military parade for the president isn’t exactly essential.

“I might be,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said of attending the parade. As for its costs? “Uh, I have not looked into the price.”

But GOP senators also don’t want to say anything that will anger the president, even if deep down, they’re not happy about spending tens of millions of dollars on something that the second-highest-ranking U.S. general told Trump in his first term is “what dictators do.” So they seem to be opting for going silent or fleeing the scene.

“I am committed in Boise,” Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said of his plans for Saturday. “I appreciate the Army and the fact that they’re 250 years old.”

As for the cost of the military parade, he just walked away, saying, “That’s all you’re going to get.”

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) dismissed any conversation at all about it, saying she doesn’t “do hallway interviews.” (Most conversations with the press happen in Senate hallways.)

“No comment,” said Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “No comment.”

To be sure, a few Republicans said they were fine with the costs to put on the event.

“Listen, the Army has done a lot for us,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullen (R-Okla.). “The idea that we get to celebrate their 250th birthday, I think they deserve to have a good celebration.”

Advertisement

He won’t be there, though. “It is my 28th wedding anniversary,” he said. “I choose marriage.”

Sen. Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) said he’s very supportive of “a celebration of our president’s birthday,” and the costs of the parade don’t bother him because he wants it to look impressive to people in other countries.

“I mean, if you go out there with, you know, two jeeps and an M-16, you know, how does the world perceive that?” Justice said. “Come on now, this is America, you know?… If we’re going to do it, let’s put on a big show.”

Out of 14 GOP senators, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was the only one HuffPost talked to who criticized holding the parade. It’s not just because of its hefty costs, he said, but also because he doesn’t think ”the symbolism of tanks and missiles” represents what the United States is all about.

The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill on Tuesday that would repeal a 30-year-old federal law created to safeguard abortion clinics — even as violence against providers and clinics has skyrocketed since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections.

The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, also known as the FACE Act, was enacted in 1994 by President Bill Clinton in response to escalating violence against abortion clinics. The law made it a federal crime to use force or the threat of force to injure, intimidate or block any person trying to provide or access reproductive health care services. While the law has primarily been used to protect abortion clinics, it also protects fertility clinics, anti-abortion pregnancy centers, churches and other places of religious worship from similar violence.

Anti-abortion violence dropped by 30% when the FACE Act was first signed into law. The law is arguably now more important than ever, since federal abortion protections fell in 2022 and violence against providers and clinics have skyrocketed. The year the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade, there was a 538% increase in people obstructing clinic entrances, a 913% increase in stalking of clinic staff and a 133% increase in bomb threats, according to a National Abortion Federation report.

Reproductive rights are under attack. HuffPost is committed to reporting the truth, amplifying voices, and covering this fight with depth and care. Support our work by joining our membership program today.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) introduced the FACE Act Repeal Act of 2025 earlier this year, claiming that President Joe Biden’s administration weaponized the law to prosecute anti-abortion activists. The repeal is part of a yearslong push by the GOP to stoke a false narrative that Democrats are waging a war against the anti-abortion religious right. Republican support for the bill comes less than a month after a California fertility clinic was bombed and one person died.

Advertisement

After a heated debate on Tuesday, the repeal bill passed in a 13-10 vote along party lines. It now heads to the House for consideration.

“NAF has been tracking anti-abortion violence since 1977, and we know this for certain: when the FACE Act is being enforced, it is an effective and important tool to keep abortion providers and their patients safe,” Julie Gonen, chief legal officer at the National Abortion Federation (NAF), said in a Tuesday statement. “It is unconscionable to see anti-abortion legislators trying to repeal a law that has been keeping people safe for decades.”

During Tuesday’s debate, Roy claimed that he had little issue with the actual law and instead worried about overcriminalization and the Biden administration’s “one-sided enforcement of the law.” He noted that he’s received pushback from within the Trump administration over his repeal bill because he said the administration is looking to use the FACE Act to protect churches.

Advertisement

“The previous administration weaponized the FACE Act to prosecute nonviolent pro-life Americans with the harshest sentences,” Roy said, routinely referring to abortion clinics and pro-choice advocates as “anti-life.”

Republicans argued that the law has been disproportionately applied against anti-abortion advocates who protest at abortion clinics. Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said there has “most certainly been egregious abuse” from the Biden administration’s “selective enforcement” of the law.

Roy said in his opening statement that 8% of the FACE Act cases filed under Biden’s Department of Justice were against protesters at anti-abortion centers and 92% were against anti-abortion activists at abortion clinics. Because of this there should be a full repeal of the federal law, Republicans argued.

Advertisement

But several Democrats pointed out that simply looking at the numbers does not prove selective enforcement of the law. Instead, it shows that abortion clinics face a disproportionate amount of harassment and violence from anti-abortion protesters.

“The FACE Act is completely viewpoint neutral in its textual scope and viewpoint neutral in its application,” ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said. “If more people have been convicted of attacking pro-choice abortion clinics than have been convicted of attacking pro-life pregnancy centers, as my friend from Texas suggests, it is because there have been vastly more people attacking abortion clinics than attacking pregnancy centers.”

The only Republican on the committee who did not support a full repeal was Rep. Tom McClintock (Calif.), who said enforcement was abused but the law should instead be revised.

Advertisement

Days into his presidency, Donald Trump announced he would limit enforcement of the FACE Act. He dismissed a handful of current ongoing FACE investigations and instructed prosecutors to apply the law only in “extraordinary circumstances” such as instances of death, extreme bodily harm or significant property damage.

Trump also pardoned 23 people for FACE convictions that ranged from harassing pregnant patients to breaking into clinics and stealing fetal tissue. Several of those pardoned, some of whom were serving prison time, have already said they plan to return to targeting and invading abortion clinics.

Abortion providers, clinic staff and other experts working in the reproductive health field told HuffPost shortly after Trump’s announcement that they were deeply demoralized by the administration’s decision. Some had already seen an increase in aggression and hostility from protesters in the few weeks since Trump took office.

“Unless you have worked at an abortion clinic, you will never understand the terror we face on a daily basis,” Renee Chelian, founder and CEO of Michigan abortion clinic Northland Family Planning, said in a statement following the advancement of the bill to repeal the FACE Act.

Chelian and her staff have survived arson attacks and a chemical bomb, as well as bomb and death threats. Eight of the protesters who attacked Northland Family Planning were convicted under the FACE Act during the Biden administration, but were later pardoned by Trump.

“Our patients have been blockaded from entering while needing immediate medical attention.

One Department of Homeland Security official seems to think she can throw down with a woman raised by Kris Jenner.

On Wednesday, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, decided to pick a fight with Kim Kardashian after the reality TV star simply exercised her freedom of speech.

Amid the ongoing anti-deportation protests in Los Angeles that were sparked by a rash of terrifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, Kardashian made it clear on her Instagram story Tuesday that her values align with the demonstrators.

“When we’re told that ICE exists to keep our country safe and remove violent criminals — great,” Kardashian began her statement. “When we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up. We have to do what’s right.”

She continued, “Growing up in LA, I’ve seen how deeply immigrants are woven into the fabric of this city. They are our neighbors, friends, classmates, coworkers, and family.”

“No matter where you fall politically, it’s clear that our communities thrive because of the contributions of immigrants,” she wrote.

The beauty mogul concluded, “We can’t turn a blind eye when fear and injustice keep people from living their lives freely and safely. There HAS to be a BETTER way.”

When Kardashian’s statement made its way to X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday, it seemed to really get McLaughlin’s Skims in a twist.

“.@KimKardashian, which one of these convicted child molesters, murderers, drug traffickers and rapists would you like to stay in the county? These are just a few of the convicted illegal criminals who have been picked up in the last 72 hours,” McLaughlin wrote on X, alongside images of a few men who have been detained by ICE in Los Angeles, per some very colorfully worded DHS press releases that include quotes from McLaughlin.

Kardashian, who graduated from law school in May, has an interesting history with the Trump family. In 2018, she met with President Donald Trump during his first term to advocate for prison reform, and later claimed she helped soften his stance on crime (which, apparently, did not work).

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats helped clear the way for passage of a landmark cryptocurrency bill on Wednesday as the industry capitalizes on the tens of millions of dollars it spent on congressional elections last year.

The 68-30 vote to advance the bill occurred amid growing scrutiny of President Donald Trump’s various crypto dealings, which have enriched his family and presented unprecedented conflicts of interest for his administration. Eighteen Democrats voted “yea.” A final vote on passage is expected next week.

The legislation, titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, would be a first step toward making the scam-riddled cryptocurrency industry part of the U.S. financial system, establishing federal oversight of stablecoins, which have their value connected to another asset, and raising the prospect of future crypto bailouts. The bill was stalled for weeks by demands for changes from senators on both sides of the aisle that were ultimately blocked by GOP leadership.

HuffPost is dedicated to holding lawmakers accountable and covering how their actions impact you, your community, and the country. Support journalism that demands transparency — join our membership program today.

To its critics, the bill’s progress shows the power of $130 million in crypto campaign cash even as Trump flouts every imaginable standard of good government.

“This bill wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the crypto lobby,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said. “Why is the industry here asking for regulation? They want the benefits of the gold star, U.S. government oversight without really having significant oversight. And that’s the GENIUS Act.”

Democrats had sought to amend the bill to prohibit the president, vice president, and senior government officials from directly or indirectly profiting from a stablecoin venture while in office. In recent weeks, Trump has generated outrage by hosting an exclusive dinner with the president for the top buyers of his personal $TRUMP meme coin, raising corruption, ethics and security concerns. His businesses have moved to expand investments in bitcoin while at the same time his administration is working to reduce regulation of the industry and weaken enforcement against certain cryptocurrency crimes.

Republicans balked at that provision, however, shielding Trump and forcing Democrats who supported the legislation, some of whom had received significant financial backing from the crypto industry, to back down.

“He’s gonna have to abide by all the ethics rules that anyone else will,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost. “What they want specifically is a carve-out to block him. We could not get that in.”

Gallego’s 2024 Senate campaign was aided by $10 million from super PACs financed by three large crypto companies, including the Coinbase digital currency exchange. The money financed positive ads in support of the Arizona Democrat. He’s now one of the strongest advocates of the GENIUS Act in the Senate.

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who benefited from the super PAC spending millions against former Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) in a primary, is also a leading advocate. So is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who is chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this cycle.

Other Democrats who backed the GENIUS Act said their support for the measure had nothing to do with the crypto industry’s massive 2024 campaign spending.

“I got no help from the crypto industry,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.). “I have had no real engagements with that industry, on any political side, you know, I’m just trying to think through this problem that we have right now, which is that, North Korea right now, and cartels and terrorist groups, they are already exploiting this technology for billions of dollars worth of illicit financing, and I want to stop that. So that’s, you know, that’s something that we’re going to try to do.”

Unlike Gallego, who hails from a battleground state, however, Kim had less need for similar backup since he was elected to a safe seat in reliably blue New Jersey. But other Democrats who didn’t face reelection also voted for the bill on Wednesday.

Warren and other critics of the bill said not only was voting for it tantamount to endorsing Trump’s corruption in office, but that it would weaken financial stability. The bill’s haters and supporters agree it would turbocharge the market for stablecoins by putting stablecoin issuers under the supervision of bank regulators.

Warren compared their tactics to banks who lobbied Congress in 2000 for regulations that ultimately let derivatives markets run wild, contributing to the Great Recession. Like the derivatives lobbyists a quarter-century ago, crypto advocates say legislation is needed to protect financial “innovation” and to keep the innovators on American shores.

Under the legislation, companies that issue stablecoins — and pretty much any company could obtain permission to do so — would be required to maintain certain levels of reserves, like a bank does, to prevent panics among stablecoin holders, like what happened in 2022 when the stablecoin Terra lost its “peg” to the value of the U.S. dollar. Democrats pushed for stricter rules for what kinds of assets could count as reserves.

One controversial provision of the bill addresses what would happen if a stablecoin issuer goes bankrupt. Part of the section puts stablecoin holders ahead of other claims in terms of gets paid first, potentially including bank depositors whose deposits are insured by the federal government.

“It’s a way to make sure that U.S. taxpayers bail out any stablecoin shortfalls,” said Warren, an expert on bankruptcy law. “The provision puts people holding stablecoins ahead of depositors in banks. The federal government won’t let those depositors fail, which means the stablecoin guys get theirs first.”

The main argument for the legislation from its Democratic supporters is that people are already buying and selling stablecoins in what has been a legal gray area. When Trump returned to the White House in January, he essentially called off efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce securities laws against the crypto industry.

Brooke Shields admitted in a recent podcast that she once interrupted Meghan Markle during a panel over a story that was “so serious,” and now the episode apparently has been deleted.

The actor, 60, made the admission while chatting with King Charles’ goddaughter India Hicks during an episode of the latter’s podcast, which was released earlier this month. The podcast is no longer visible on Hick’s website, multiple outlets reported.

During the episode, Shields reflected on a SXSW panel led by Katie Couric that she and Meghan participated in. The panel, “Breaking Barriers, Shaping Narratives: How Women Lead On and Off the Screen,” took place back in March 2024. (Watch video of the panel here and skip to about the 6:30 mark for the comments in question.)

But according to the “Mother of the Bride” star, her interaction with the Duchess of Sussex didn’t quite go according to plan.

Recalling that Markle told a story during the panel that involved her writing a letter “advocating for women” at the age of 11, Shields told Hicks that she found the “Suits” actor’s anecdote to be out of place and too “serious.”

Advertisement

“Katie asks the first question to Meghan and [she] talks about how at a young age, she was already advocating for women,” Shields began. “She starts talking and telling a story about how when she was 11 — and she keeps saying, ‘Well, when I was 11, I saw this commercial and they were talking about how washing dishes … was for women.’”

“And [Markle] said, ‘I didn’t think only women wash dishes. It wasn’t fair. So I wrote to the company,’” Shields continued. “She kept saying she was 11! She [wrote] some company, they changed the text, they changed the commercial.”

Shields claimed that she interrupted Markle’s story in an effort to uplift the mood of the panel.

“I go, ‘Excuse me, I’m so sorry, I’ve just got to interrupt you there for one minute,’” Shields recalled telling Markle. “I was trying not to be rude, but I wanted to be funny because it was so serious.”

Shields said she then cracked a joke to the audience, telling them, “I just want to give everybody here a context as to how we’re different. When I was 11, I was playing a prostitute.”

Her joke was in reference to her lead role in 1978′s “Pretty Baby” — a film based on a young girl who was sexually exploited by being forced into prostitution by her mother at the age of 12.

“The [venue] went insane and then luckily it was more relaxed after that,” Shields added.

The “That’s ’70s Show” alum told Hicks that at the time she hoped Markle didn’t consider her actions to be “rude.”

“I was like ‘I hope she doesn’t think I’m rude. I’m not being rude.’ It was just too precious, and I was like, [the audience is] not going to want to sit here for 45 minutes and listen to anybody be precious or serious,” Shields explained.

HuffPost has reached out to reps for Shields and Markle for comment.

Social media users on X, formerly Twitter, shared mixed reactions over the reportedly deleted clip online.

“Brooke shields confessing that she interrupted Megan‘s ridiculous commercial story when she was 11 years old.. .. and adding her own version of what she did when she was 11 years old is probably the best thing I’ve heard [sic],” one user said.

Brian Wilson, one of the founding members of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82.

“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,” a statement on Wilson’s Instagram reads. “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy”

Wilson’s death comes about a year and a half after his wife, Melinda Ledbetter, died. Ledbetter was often credited with getting Wilson healthy after he was under the controversial “24-hour therapy” of psychologist Eugene Landy.

Wilson’s family didn’t specify how Wilson died. He had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder, and since 1965 had regularly experienced auditory hallucinations.

In 2024, a judge found that Wilson should be put in a conservatorship because of his “major neurocognitive disorder.”

The creative driving force behind the Beach Boys, Wilson wrote and co-wrote what would become some of the most memorable songs in U.S. history during his life. All told, Wilson had his hand in more than two dozen Top 40 hits over the course of his life, most of which came in the 1960s, including “Good Vibrations,” “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” “Fun, Fun, Fun,” “I Get Around” and “Barbara Ann.”

“I wanted to write joyful music that would make other people feel good,” Wilson said during The Beach Boys’ induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. “That’s what I tried to do.”

But there is little question that Wilson’s enduring legacy will be 1966’s “Pet Sounds,” the album Rolling Stone once proclaimed to be the second best of all time. Wilson was inspired to write “Pet Sounds” after hearing The Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” which opened his eyes to what a fully formed album could be. Wilson later said he told himself, “If I ever do anything in my life, I’m going to make that good an album.”

In Paul McCartney’s eyes, he did. The former Beatle has said that “Pet Sounds” has repeatedly brought him to tears throughout his life, and he counts one of the tracks on it, the simultaneously soothing and complex “God Only Knows,” as his favorite song of all time. “No one’s musical education is complete without hearing that album,” McCartney once said.

Just as “Rubber Soul” pushed Wilson to make “Pet Sounds,” “Pet Sounds” pushed the Beatles to make perhaps their most famous album: “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”

“Without ‘Pet Sounds,’ ‘Sgt. Pepper’ never would have happened,” Beatles producer George Martin once said. “‘Pepper’ was an attempt to equal ‘Pet Sounds.’”

Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, in Inglewood, California, and raised in the nearby city of Hawthorne by his parents, Murry Wilson and Audree Neva. The oldest of three boys, all of whom would eventually join the Beach Boys, Brian was physically and emotionally abused by his father from a young age.

“I had a good childhood — except for my dad beating me up all the time,” he once said.

But Wilson and his two brothers, Dennis and Carl, nevertheless came to adopt their father’s love of music in spite of his abuse and Brian’s near-deafness in one ear. Together, they learned to harmonize in the living room and eventually formed a band called the Pendletones, which their label later renamed the Beach Boys, even though Brian didn’t know how to surf.

Thus began a prolific half-decade of Wilson’s writing career. Between 1962 and 1967, when Brian was in his early 20s, The Beach Boys released 13 albums in total and enjoyed massive success. But the lifestyle took its toll on Wilson, who suffered a nervous breakdown while touring in 1964 ― the same year he married his first wife, Marilyn Rovell ― and would go on to struggle with both drug and alcohol abuse and “schizoaffective disorder, which is ... manic depressive with auditory hallucinations,” as his second wife, Ledbetter, later described it.

It was in this way that one of the Beach Boys’ albums, “Smile,” didn’t see the light of day for 37 years, leading to decades of whispers, wonder, theories and gossip. Asked in 2011 why “Smile” took so long to put out, Wilson replied in his usual laconic manner, “Because we were on drugs and we didn’t really know how to finish it.”

By the 1970s, Wilson’s life, let alone his career, was in shambles. His weight ballooned to more than 300 pounds as he struggled with addiction and became a recluse in his California home for several years. According to Biography.com, Wilson could sometimes be spotted at clubs in the city, not in his right mind and wearing only a bathrobe and slippers.

Soon after, Landy came into Wilson’s life, employing the controversial “24-hour therapy” regimen that got Wilson off drugs but made him utterly dependent on Landy, who came to dominate Wilson’s life both creatively and financially.

Eventually, Wilson’s family had to sue Landy in the early 1990s to obtain a restraining order against the psychologist, who subsequently handed over his license. (Wilson and Landy’s relationship is portrayed in the critically acclaimed 2015 film “Love & Mercy,” named after his 1988 solo song.)

In the 34 years since his legal separation from Landy, Wilson’s general condition improved. He married Ledbetter in 1995. He was father to seven children: Carnie and Wendy of Wilson Phillips fame from his first marriage, along with five children he adopted with Ledbetter.

Wilson released a series of solo albums over the years, and in 2004, he finally unveiled “Smile” to widespread critical acclaim. That year, while talking with Larry King, Wilson said, “I’ve got a happy life ... I’m not as depressed as I was. I get depressed now and then, but not very much anymore.”

Despite suffering from lifelong stage fright, Wilson started to tour once again, his calming harmonies filling the air and soothing both the audience’s pain and his own.

WASHINGTON – They snapped. They stared off into space. They zipped into Senate elevators and smiled as the doors closed with them safely inside.

This is how nearly a dozen Senate Republicans reacted Wednesday when asked the simplest question: Do you plan to attend President Donald Trump’s military parade in D.C. on Saturday, and are you comfortable with its estimated $45 million price tag?

“I won’t be here in town, but I wish I was,” lamented Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.).

Asked about the tens of millions of dollars the event is going to cost taxpayers, Fischer walked into a nearby Senate elevator and gazed into nothingness as the doors closed.

At least the Nebraska senator spoke. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) clocked in at eight seconds of silence in response to HuffPost asking the same question. With a big grin, Budd slipped into another elevator and stood there, waiting for the doors to close.

“Nope,” Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) said, fidgeting on his phone, when asked if he planned to attend. He let out a big sigh when asked about the parade’s price tag, and started talking about unrelated legislation.

“I’m focused on the trillions right now, which is the reconciliation bill,” Young said. “So I think my constituents would assess that my priorities are appropriate.”

Asked if that means he is comfortable with how much Trump’s military event will cost taxpayers, he snapped: “I answered the question.”

When HuffPost pointed out he didn’t actually answer the question, Young interrupted, “I answered the question I wanted to answer!’

Alrighty then, sir!

Saturday’s parade is being billed as a celebration of the Army’s 250th anniversary, but it’s also timed with Trump’s 79th birthday. The event will feature thousands of soldiers, 150 military vehicles and more than 50 aircraft being rolled around the streets of D.C.

Millions of people nationwide will be protesting Trump at the same time as his parade, in response to his harsh crackdown on immigration enforcement and his decision to deploy the U.S. military to Los Angeles to respond to unrest there. The “No Kings Day” protests are happening in all 50 states and in more than 1,500 cities, though not in D.C.

An obvious reason Senate Republicans don’t want to talk about the cost of this parade is that they’ve been on a tear about slashing so-called government waste since Trump took office, and a massive military parade for the president isn’t exactly essential.

“I might be,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said of attending the parade. As for its costs? “Uh, I have not looked into the price.”

Advertisement

But GOP senators also don’t want to say anything that will anger the president, even if deep down, they’re not happy about spending tens of millions of dollars on something that the second-highest-ranking U.S. general told Trump in his first term is “what dictators do.” So they seem to be opting for going silent or fleeing the scene.

“I am committed in Boise,” Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said of his plans for Saturday. “I appreciate the Army and the fact that they’re 250 years old.”

As for the cost of the military parade, he just walked away, saying, “That’s all you’re going to get.”

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) dismissed any conversation at all about it, saying she doesn’t “do hallway interviews.” (Most conversations with the press happen in Senate hallways.)

“No comment,” said Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “No comment.”

“That’s all you’re going to get,"" said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), when asked if he's comfortable spending $45 million on a military parade for Trump. Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images

To be sure, a few Republicans said they were fine with the costs to put on the event.

“Listen, the Army has done a lot for us,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullen (R-Okla.). “The idea that we get to celebrate their 250th birthday, I think they deserve to have a good celebration.”

He won’t be there, though. “It is my 28th wedding anniversary,” he said. “I choose marriage.”

Sen. Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) said he’s very supportive of “a celebration of our president’s birthday,” and the costs of the parade don’t bother him because he wants it to look impressive to people in other countries.

“I mean, if you go out there with, you know, two jeeps and an M-16, you know, how does the world perceive that?” Justice said. “Come on now, this is America, you know?… If we’re going to do it, let’s put on a big show.”

Out of 14 GOP senators, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was the only one HuffPost talked to who criticized holding the parade. It’s not just because of its hefty costs, he said, but also because he doesn’t think ”the symbolism of tanks and missiles” represents what the United States is all about.

The Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill on Tuesday that would repeal a 30-year-old federal law created to safeguard abortion clinics — even as violence against providers and clinics has skyrocketed since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections.

The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, also known as the FACE Act, was enacted in 1994 by President Bill Clinton in response to escalating violence against abortion clinics. The law made it a federal crime to use force or the threat of force to injure, intimidate or block any person trying to provide or access reproductive health care services. While the law has primarily been used to protect abortion clinics, it also protects fertility clinics, anti-abortion pregnancy centers, churches and other places of religious worship from similar violence.

Anti-abortion violence dropped by 30% when the FACE Act was first signed into law. The law is arguably now more important than ever, since federal abortion protections fell in 2022 and violence against providers and clinics have skyrocketed. The year the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade, there was a 538% increase in people obstructing clinic entrances, a 913% increase in stalking of clinic staff and a 133% increase in bomb threats, according to a National Abortion Federation report.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) introduced the FACE Act Repeal Act of 2025 earlier this year, claiming that President Joe Biden’s administration weaponized the law to prosecute anti-abortion activists. The repeal is part of a yearslong push by the GOP to stoke a false narrative that Democrats are waging a war against the anti-abortion religious right. Republican support for the bill comes less than a month after a California fertility clinic was bombed and one person died.

After a heated debate on Tuesday, the repeal bill passed in a 13-10 vote along party lines. It now heads to the House for consideration.

“NAF has been tracking anti-abortion violence since 1977, and we know this for certain: when the FACE Act is being enforced, it is an effective and important tool to keep abortion providers and their patients safe,” Julie Gonen, chief legal officer at the National Abortion Federation (NAF), said in a Tuesday statement. “It is unconscionable to see anti-abortion legislators trying to repeal a law that has been keeping people safe for decades.”

During Tuesday’s debate, Roy claimed that he had little issue with the actual law and instead worried about overcriminalization and the Biden administration’s “one-sided enforcement of the law.” He noted that he’s received pushback from within the Trump administration over his repeal bill because he said the administration is looking to use the FACE Act to protect churches.

“The previous administration weaponized the FACE Act to prosecute nonviolent pro-life Americans with the harshest sentences,” Roy said, routinely referring to abortion clinics and pro-choice advocates as “anti-life.”

Republicans argued that the law has been disproportionately applied against anti-abortion advocates who protest at abortion clinics. Chairman of the Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said there has “most certainly been egregious abuse” from the Biden administration’s “selective enforcement” of the law.

Roy said in his opening statement that 8% of the FACE Act cases filed under Biden’s Department of Justice were against protesters at anti-abortion centers and 92% were against anti-abortion activists at abortion clinics. Because of this there should be a full repeal of the federal law, Republicans argued.

But several Democrats pointed out that simply looking at the numbers does not prove selective enforcement of the law. Instead, it shows that abortion clinics face a disproportionate amount of harassment and violence from anti-abortion protesters.

“The FACE Act is completely viewpoint neutral in its textual scope and viewpoint neutral in its application,” ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said. “If more people have been convicted of attacking pro-choice abortion clinics than have been convicted of attacking pro-life pregnancy centers, as my friend from Texas suggests, it is because there have been vastly more people attacking abortion clinics than attacking pregnancy centers.”

The only Republican on the committee who did not support a full repeal was Rep. Tom McClintock (Calif.), who said enforcement was abused but the law should instead be revised.

Days into his presidency, Donald Trump announced he would limit enforcement of the FACE Act. He dismissed a handful of current ongoing FACE investigations and instructed prosecutors to apply the law only in “extraordinary circumstances” such as instances of death, extreme bodily harm or significant property damage.

Trump also pardoned 23 people for FACE convictions that ranged from harassing pregnant patients to breaking into clinics and stealing fetal tissue. Several of those pardoned, some of whom were serving prison time, have already said they plan to return to targeting and invading abortion clinics.

Abortion providers, clinic staff and other experts working in the reproductive health field told HuffPost shortly after Trump’s announcement that they were deeply demoralized by the administration’s decision. Some had already seen an increase in aggression and hostility from protesters in the few weeks since Trump took office.

“Unless you have worked at an abortion clinic, you will never understand the terror we face on a daily basis,” Renee Chelian, founder and CEO of Michigan abortion clinic Northland Family Planning, said in a statement following the advancement of the bill to repeal the FACE Act.

Chelian and her staff have survived arson attacks and a chemical bomb, as well as bomb and death threats. Eight of the protesters who attacked Northland Family Planning were convicted under the FACE Act during the Biden administration, but were later pardoned by Trump.

One Department of Homeland Security official seems to think she can throw down with a woman raised by Kris Jenner.

On Wednesday, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, decided to pick a fight with Kim Kardashian after the reality TV star simply exercised her freedom of speech.

Amid the ongoing anti-deportation protests in Los Angeles that were sparked by a rash of terrifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, Kardashian made it clear on her Instagram story Tuesday that her values align with the demonstrators.

“When we’re told that ICE exists to keep our country safe and remove violent criminals — great,” Kardashian began her statement. “When we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up. We have to do what’s right.”

She continued, “Growing up in LA, I’ve seen how deeply immigrants are woven into the fabric of this city. They are our neighbors, friends, classmates, coworkers, and family.”

“No matter where you fall politically, it’s clear that our communities thrive because of the contributions of immigrants,” she wrote.

The beauty mogul concluded, “We can’t turn a blind eye when fear and injustice keep people from living their lives freely and safely. There HAS to be a BETTER way.”

When Kardashian’s statement made its way to X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday, it seemed to really get McLaughlin’s Skims in a twist.

“.@KimKardashian, which one of these convicted child molesters, murderers, drug traffickers and rapists would you like to stay in the county? These are just a few of the convicted illegal criminals who have been picked up in the last 72 hours,” McLaughlin wrote on X, alongside images of a few men who have been detained by ICE in Los Angeles, per some very colorfully worded DHS press releases that include quotes from McLaughlin.

Although McLaughlin didn’t like Kardashian’s statement, plenty of social media users did.

Kardashian, who graduated from law school in May, has an interesting history with the Trump family. In 2018, she met with President Donald Trump during his first term to advocate for prison reform, and later claimed she helped soften his stance on crime (which, apparently, did not work).

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats helped clear the way for passage of a landmark cryptocurrency bill on Wednesday as the industry capitalizes on the tens of millions of dollars it spent on congressional elections last year.

The 68-30 vote to advance the bill occurred amid growing scrutiny of President Donald Trump’s various crypto dealings, which have enriched his family and presented unprecedented conflicts of interest for his administration. Eighteen Democrats voted “yea.” A final vote on passage is expected next week.

The legislation, titled the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, would be a first step toward making the scam-riddled cryptocurrency industry part of the U.S. financial system, establishing federal oversight of stablecoins, which have their value connected to another asset, and raising the prospect of future crypto bailouts. The bill was stalled for weeks by demands for changes from senators on both sides of the aisle that were ultimately blocked by GOP leadership.

HuffPost is dedicated to holding lawmakers accountable and covering how their actions impact you, your community, and the country. Support journalism that demands transparency — join our membership program today.

To its critics, the bill’s progress shows the power of $130 million in crypto campaign cash even as Trump flouts every imaginable standard of good government.

“This bill wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the crypto lobby,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said. “Why is the industry here asking for regulation? They want the benefits of the gold star, U.S. government oversight without really having significant oversight. And that’s the GENIUS Act.”

Democrats had sought to amend the bill to prohibit the president, vice president, and senior government officials from directly or indirectly profiting from a stablecoin venture while in office. In recent weeks, Trump has generated outrage by hosting an exclusive dinner with the president for the top buyers of his personal $TRUMP meme coin, raising corruption, ethics and security concerns. His businesses have moved to expand investments in bitcoin while at the same time his administration is working to reduce regulation of the industry and weaken enforcement against certain cryptocurrency crimes.

Republicans balked at that provision, however, shielding Trump and forcing Democrats who supported the legislation, some of whom had received significant financial backing from the crypto industry, to back down.

“He’s gonna have to abide by all the ethics rules that anyone else will,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost. “What they want specifically is a carve-out to block him. We could not get that in.”

Gallego’s 2024 Senate campaign was aided by $10 million from super PACs financed by three large crypto companies, including the Coinbase digital currency exchange. The money financed positive ads in support of the Arizona Democrat. He’s now one of the strongest advocates of the GENIUS Act in the Senate.

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who benefited from the super PAC spending millions against former Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) in a primary, is also a leading advocate. So is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who is chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this cycle.

Other Democrats who backed the GENIUS Act said their support for the measure had nothing to do with the crypto industry’s massive 2024 campaign spending.

“I got no help from the crypto industry,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.). “I have had no real engagements with that industry, on any political side, you know, I’m just trying to think through this problem that we have right now, which is that, North Korea right now, and cartels and terrorist groups, they are already exploiting this technology for billions of dollars worth of illicit financing, and I want to stop that. So that’s, you know, that’s something that we’re going to try to do.”

Unlike Gallego, who hails from a battleground state, however, Kim had less need for similar backup since he was elected to a safe seat in reliably blue New Jersey. But other Democrats who didn’t face reelection also voted for the bill on Wednesday.

Warren and other critics of the bill said not only was voting for it tantamount to endorsing Trump’s corruption in office, but that it would weaken financial stability. The bill’s haters and supporters agree it would turbocharge the market for stablecoins by putting stablecoin issuers under the supervision of bank regulators.

Warren compared their tactics to banks who lobbied Congress in 2000 for regulations that ultimately let derivatives markets run wild, contributing to the Great Recession. Like the derivatives lobbyists a quarter-century ago, crypto advocates say legislation is needed to protect financial “innovation” and to keep the innovators on American shores.

Under the legislation, companies that issue stablecoins — and pretty much any company could obtain permission to do so — would be required to maintain certain levels of reserves, like a bank does, to prevent panics among stablecoin holders, like what happened in 2022 when the stablecoin Terra lost its “peg” to the value of the U.S. dollar. Democrats pushed for stricter rules for what kinds of assets could count as reserves.

Advertisement

One controversial provision of the bill addresses what would happen if a stablecoin issuer goes bankrupt. Part of the section puts stablecoin holders ahead of other claims in terms of gets paid first, potentially including bank depositors whose deposits are insured by the federal government.

“It’s a way to make sure that U.S. taxpayers bail out any stablecoin shortfalls,” said Warren, an expert on bankruptcy law. “The provision puts people holding stablecoins ahead of depositors in banks. The federal government won’t let those depositors fail, which means the stablecoin guys get theirs first.”

The main argument for the legislation from its Democratic supporters is that people are already buying and selling stablecoins in what has been a legal gray area. When Trump returned to the White House in January, he essentially called off efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce securities laws against the crypto industry.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marines-los-angeles-national-guard-detain_n_684a5371e4b0cf5f0c9b1d25?iz,"LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Marines will join National Guard troops on the streets of Los Angeles within two days, officials said on Wednesday, and would be authorized to detain anyone who interferes with immigration officers on raids or protesters who confront federal agents.

U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the deployments over the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom, sparking a national debate about the use of the military on U.S. soil and animating protests that have spread from Los Angeles to other major cities, including New York, Atlanta and Chicago.

Los Angeles on Wednesday endured a sixth day of protests that have been largely peaceful but occasionally punctuated by violence, mostly contained to a few blocks of the city’s downtown area.

The protests broke out last Friday in response to a series of immigration raids. Trump in turn called in the National Guard on Saturday, then summoned the Marines on Monday.

“If I didn’t act quickly on that, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground right now,” said Trump at an event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

State and local leaders dispute that, saying Trump has only escalated tensions with an unnecessary and illegal deployment of federal troops, while Democrats nationally have condemned his action as authoritarian.

Trump is carrying out a campaign promise to deport immigrants, employing forceful tactics consistent with the norm-breaking political style that got him elected twice.

“President Trump promised to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history and left-wing riots will not deter him in that effort,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

The U.S. military said on Wednesday that a battalion of 700 Marines had concluded training specific to the L.A. mission, including de-escalation and crowd control. They would join National Guard under the authority of a federal law known as Title 10 within 48 hours, not to conduct civilian policing but to protect federal officers and property, the military said.

“Title 10 forces may temporarily detain an individual in specific circumstances such as to stop an assault, to prevent harm to others, or to prevent interference with federal personnel performing their duties,” the Northern Command said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “If any rioters attack ICE law enforcement officers, military personnel have the authority to temporarily detain them until law enforcement makes the arrest.”

U.S. Army Major General Scott Sherman, who commands the task force of Marines and Guardsmen, told reporters the Marines will not carry live ammunition in their rifles, but they will carry live rounds.

Newsom and the state of California have sued Trump and the Defense Department to stop the deployment, maintaining that none of the Title 10 conditions were met to justify military deployment - such as a when the U.S. is under threat from a foreign invasion or rebellion.

California is also seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the National Guard and Marines from participating in civilian law enforcement.

A hearing on that restraining order is scheduled for Thursday in San Francisco federal court.

The Trump administration argued in a court filing ahead of the hearing that the president has the discretion to determine whether a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion” requires a military response.

PROTESTS SPREAD NATIONWIDE

In downtown L.A., shortly before the second night of a curfew over a one square mile (2.5 square km) area, relative calm was broken.

Police said demonstrators at one location threw commercial grade fireworks and rocks at officers. Another group of nearly 1,000 demonstrators were peacefully marching through downtown when police suddenly opened fired with less lethal munitions in front of City Hall.

Marlene Lopez, 39, a Los Angeles native, was demonstrating as flash bangs exploded just a few meters away.

“I am out here because of the fact that our human rights are being violated every day. If we give up, it’s over. We have to stand our ground here in L.A. so that the nation will follow us,” Lopez said.

Other protests have also taken place in Santa Ana, a largely Mexican-American city about 30 miles (50 km) to the south, as well as major cities such as Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston and Washington and San Antonio, Texas.

New York police said an unknown number of people had been taken into custody on Wednesday. On Tuesday New York police said they took 86 people into custody, of which 34 were arrested and charged, while the others received a criminal court summons.

The protests are set to expand on Saturday, when several activist groups have planned more than 1,800 anti-Trump demonstrations across the country. That day, tanks and other armored vehicles will rumble down the streets of Washington, D.C., in a military parade marking the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and coinciding with Trump’s 79th birthday.

His statement signals a more punitive approach toward activists as protests in Los Angeles have spread to other places including Brookhaven, Georgia.

“We are not California or New York,” Carr said. “We are Georgia. We don’t make excuses for criminals here. We prosecute them.”

Domestic terrorism charges can come with a hefty 35-year sentence, and have also previously been levied against protesters in the state who opposed a law enforcement training center dubbed Cop City.

Activists who were forcibly detained by Israeli forces while sailing to Gaza with humanitarian aid say they’ve been facing abuse and threats from authorities while held in inhumane conditions — but are pleading for the public to stay focused on Israel’s destructive campaign in the walled-off Palestinian territory.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which organized the humanitarian mission, said that Israeli forces told detained activists to sign a document admitting “illegal entry into Israeli territory” in order to be deported back to their home countries. While four of them have since been deported, all of the activists strongly rejected Israel’s claim of unlawful entry.

“I did not recognize that I entered the country illegally,” Thunberg told reporters upon arriving in France on Tuesday, saying the document she signed did not include that requirement. “I made it very clear in my testimonial that we were kidnapped on international waters and brought there against our own will and into Israel.”

The activists say authorities were also threatening and abusive. Dr. Baptiste André, a French member of the crew who returned from detention, recalled “acts of abuse” by Israeli forces against the activists — especially to Thunberg, who later said that any conditions she faced “were absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine.”

“As soon as she fell asleep, the immigration services would come and wake her up” by playing loud music and dancing, André said on Tuesday. He also alleged that detainees experienced “difficulties in accessing water and food,” and had no access to toilets.

“As soon as one of the officers felt that I was starting to understand a little of what they were doing, he approached me and said to me, ‘Why are you like this and why do you smell bad?’” crew member and Al Jazeera journalist Omar Faiad said upon returning to France. “I told him, ‘You haven’t let us rest for three days.’”

Eight of the Madleen passengers remain in custody as of Wednesday, according to Adalah, the Palestinian legal group representing the activists. Among the eight is Hassan, who Faiad said was threatened by Israeli forces for refusing to sign the deportation documents.

“I heard the officer directly threatening her, ‘I’ll smash your head against the wall if you don’t sign. We’ll handle this our way,’” Faiad recalled. Thunberg also said that fellow volunteers were treated “obviously in a very dehumanizing way.”

Hassan was first placed in Givon Prison before Israeli forces put her in solitary confinement at the Neve Tirza Prison for writing “Free Palestine” on a wall, according to the FFC. In isolation, she stayed in a “small, windowless cell with extremely poor hygienic conditions and has been denied access to the prison yards.” On Wednesday, she was moved back to Givon.

The European Parliament member is not the only passenger who was allegedly isolated. Brazilian activist Thiago Avila was taken to solitary confinement in Ayalon Prison after he started a hunger and thirst strike. Israeli forces have blocked efforts by both the embassy and Avila’s lawyer to speak with his family, according to his wife, Lara.

“He told [his lawyer] that he was threatened by the Israeli forces and that they said that he would have no contact with anyone — not even his lawyer — that he would be there alone with no light, with no ventilation and, well, you know that’s psychological torture,” Lara Avila said in a recording on Wednesday.

A ruling Wednesday by the Israeli Detention Review Tribunal upheld the decision to hold the remaining eight volunteers in custody, and scheduled the next court hearing for July 8 if the activists aren’t deported before then. Adalah called the ruling “legal cover to arbitrary detention that could last for more than a month, without any judicial oversight, in violation of international law and activists’ rights.”

“Under international law, the detention of the eight remaining flotilla members is arbitrary, unlawful and must be immediately terminated and remedied,” U.N. special rapporteur Francesca Albanese posted Wednesday on X. “The boat must be released. The states of nationality of the unlawfully detained, have an obligation to intervene, decisively and without delay.”

“Please keep your focus on Gaza. People are starving, children are starving. Entire families are surviving without clean water, without food, without medicine – and this is happening on our watch,” detained activist Yasemin Acar said in a message read by her brother. “And by looking away, by staying silent, we’re complicit. There comes a point where looking away becomes a crime, and we’re there now.”

High school senior Kyle has visited Chicago three times over the last two years. The 17-year-old has grown to love the Windy City, the birthplace of one of his favorite indie rock bands, Fall Out Boy. He plans to apply to a prestigious arts college there this fall.

But the New Orleans teen and his family didn’t make these journeys for fun. Chicago was one of the only places where Kyle could continue to access testosterone, part of the gender-affirming care he needed to alleviate his intense feelings of gender dysphoria, after his home state of Louisiana’s ban on care went into effect in January 2024.

Advertisement

“I describe it as getting caught up with other boys my age,” Kyle told HuffPost about taking testosterone. He’s enjoyed hearing his voice deepen and watching his face become more square.

Kyle considers himself lucky as one of the few trans kids in his community that is able to continue accessing care by traveling out of state. He was able to get a $500 grant from the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, to make the trips more manageable. Without financial resources or family support, the vast majority of his trans friends are instead forced to wait until they’re adults to start the process of medically transitioning.

HuffPost spoke with three families of transgender youth — all of whom requested to use pseudonyms or to use first names to protect their privacy — who shared stories underscoring the lengths to which they’ve gone and the distances they’ve traveled in order to access gender-affirming care for their children in the aftermath of a tidal wave of state-level bans on this care.

They may have to continue traveling farther and farther to continue care. Future access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth is now in the hands of the Supreme Court, which is set to issue a ruling this month to decide whether state-level bans on minors are a form of sex discrimination and violate the Constitution.

Currently, more than a third of transgender youth age 13 to 17 live across the 26 states that have passed some form of a ban on gender-affirming care, according to a 2024 report from the Williams Institute.

The case before the highest court, United States v. Skrmetti, involves Tennessee law SB 1, which bars the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for the purpose of gender transition and instead encourages minors to “appreciate their sex” assigned at birth.

Advertisement

The outcome in Skrmetti rests largely on what level of judicial scrutiny, or official skepticism, the justices require Tennessee’s law to be examined under. If the court rules that Tennessee has to apply heightened scrutiny — a more rigorous review given to laws around gender discrimination — the state is more likely to lose. In that case, the courts either could flat-out rule the law is unconstitutional, or more possibly, send the case back down to a lower court for reconsideration.

If, however, the Court sides with Tennessee and allows for rational basis — a review typically reserved for economic regulations and not classifications of race, gender or national origin — this means that state’s ban would remain in effect. Experts worry that could make it more difficult for trans legal advocates to challenge other state bans on gender-affirming care for minors and adults. If the court sides with Tennessee, they say this could open up broader implications for other arenas of legal rights to privacy.

Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University, said that Skrmetti is one of several cases on the subject of rights to privacy and bodily autonomy, which have been under attack in recent decades. He thinks about the fight to uphold transgender rights as having separate but overlapping interests with rights to abortion, marriage equality, family formation and parental rights.

“When you start taking that bundle of sticks, that bundle of rights and you remove one and then maybe chop off another, suddenly that entire bundle is a little less stable,” Kreis said.

During oral arguments on Tennessee’s ban in December, the conservative justices seemed skeptical of trans legal advocates’ arguments that SB 1 violates the Constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, asked at one point if it was best to leave bans on care up to the “democratic process,” seemingly suggesting that the issue should be determined by state law — as is now the case with reproductive health care.

Advertisement

Many legal experts have begun to imagine what the landscape could look like in the event that the court upholds Tennessee’s ban.

“A loss in Skrmetti would give some wind in the sails of conservatives who are trying to chip away at Bostock,” Kreis said, referring to the landmark Supreme Court case which protected employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In Project 2025, conservative advocates signaled their desire to restrict the application of the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in Bostock to advance transgender rights — and so far at least one conservative Texas judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, has worked to minimize its impact.

The possibility of the Supreme Court upholding Tennessee’s ban especially worries families of trans youth within the state.

In Nashville, Diane has worked hard to create an affirming childhood for her soon-to-be-14-year-old trans daughter, Lily. She enrolled her in a trans support group, let her pick out her favorite skirts, and has given her space and encouragement as she figures out the kind of girl she wants to be. After Lily told her parents she was trans at age 11, by cc’ing her parents on an email declaring she used she/her pronouns, Diane quickly saw her daughter shed an “invisible weight.”

But in 2022, the state passed its ban on care for trans youth. Many providers in Nashville abruptly stopped seeing patients before the law even went into effect — and later halted care for cisgender youth that could be seen as “pathways to gender affirmation,” one doctor told HuffPost. Diane’s family began to consider out-of-state options within a few hours’ driving distance of their home, and landed on a children’s hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. They visited the hospital three times over the course of nine months, speaking with therapists, social workers and doctors.

On the last trip, Lily received a hormone blocker insert into her arm to delay the effects of her natal puberty until she turned 14. That same day, Ohio’s Republican legislature overturned a veto from Gov. Mike DeWine, banning gender-affirming care for youth in the state.

Now the family travels to a clinic in Washington, D.C., where they’ve been twice already to establish care — and in their next visit this summer, their doctors will work with the family to determine if Lily is ready to start estrogen therapy. Their insurance doesn’t cover gender-affirming care and they’ve exhausted their airline miles. The trips are difficult for Lily, who has to miss school for these appointments, as well as for Diane, who deals with chronic fatigue from long Covid.

“The idea that I’m letting my daughter follow some whim is insulting,” Diane said. “This is not a whim, this is not a phase — this is who she is.”

Other families in the South have even had to consider traveling internationally in order to get gender-affirming care for their children.

Ana, a language professor in Birmingham, Alabama, said that she ultimately decided to travel with her son back to her home country of Spain to see a doctor that specializes in gender-affirming care after she tried, and failed, to meet with out-of-state providers that had monthslong waitlists.

“It’s like swimming against the current,” Ana said, noting that she hasn’t seen her 17-year old-son smile since January. After he first came out as transgender at 13, he was heavily bullied and ostracized by his friends.

In Spain, Ana’s son (who has dual citizenship) restarted the process of establishing his gender dysphoria diagnosis and a treatment plan from the beginning, even though he had already taken testosterone for three months prior to Alabama’s ban.

Spain allows trans teens to receive hormone therapy and puberty blockers with support of their parents, and allows anyone over 16 to legally register their gender on documents. Ana said her son plans to move to Europe after graduating high school due to the level of anti-trans legislation and rhetoric in the U.S.

“It feels like he’s going to into exile,” she said.

Over the last three years, the rising anti-trans legislation in state legislatures coupled with Trump’s slate of anti-trans executive orders has dramatically shifted the life decisions of trans youth, their families and even trans adults.

Trump has wielded executive orders to threaten to pull federal funding from hospitals that serve LGBTQ+ youth, or schools that allow trans girls to play on female sports teams. Last month, House Republicans passed a massive domestic policy package that would include provisions to bar Medicaid and Affordable Care Act plans from covering gender-affirming care for trans youth and adults alike.

The vast uncertainty of the state of transgender rights — as many legal challenges to state and federal actions make their way through the courts — has many families of LGBTQ+ people holding their breath for the Skrmetti decision. But the uncertainty could swing in multiple ways.

“[Skmretti] isn’t an end-all, be-all. If trans people lose Skrmetti, it’s not supposed to be that forever and ever more states can restrict health care for trans youth,” Ezra Young, a New York lawyer and scholar, said. “The case is very fact-specific. The Supreme Court could say there might be a subset of trans youth for which the state of Tennessee has a special interest in protecting.”

Young said the outcome of Skrmetti and the scope of the ruling entirely rests on how the justices write the decision. He likens the significance of a possible victory in Skrmetti to something like Windsor v. U.S., a 2013 case before the Supreme Court that struck down parts of the Defense of Marriage Act, barring gay and lesbian couples from obtaining certain federal tax benefits.

The Windsor victory was one case in a chorus of early victories for same-sex marriage — but it wasn’t until the court’s 2015 Obergefell decision that protected the fundamental right nationwide to same-sex marriage under the Constitution.

Similarly, the landscape of trans legal rights and representation has shifted dramatically in the last five years, and often delivered a mixed bag of results.

“It feels like we’re left on an island,” said Mariah Moore, the co-director of policy and programs at Transgender Law Center.

“Ever since the Dobbs decision, we’re seeing what happens when lifesaving care is no longer available,” she said, referring to the slate of women dying or suffering pregnancy complications after being denied access to abortion-related care in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling ending the federal right to abortion.

When Moore came out as trans in 2006, she remembers how difficult it was to access gender-affirming care, especially without health insurance.

“Black trans women opened their homes for us Black trans kids to eat, be housed, find the right doctor. That’s the type of things communities did,” she said. “I’m a beneficiary of that care and that’s what was instilled in generations of queer and trans people.”

No matter the outcome this month, Moore said, she knows this isn’t the end in the fight for trans liberation.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday slammed President Donald Trump for uninviting him and his family from the White House picnic.

Paul has opposed the Trump administration’s decision to “actively” seek to suspend habeas corpus. Habeas corpus — the constitutional freedom that translates to “you should have the body” in Latin — ensures that detained individuals, whether or not they are citizens, are able to physically appear in front of a judge.

“I think I’m the first senator in the history of the United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,” Paul told reporters on Wednesday. “I just find this incredibly petty. I mean — I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president.”

The picnic is an annual event held by the White House on the South Lawn, which members from both aisles of Congress typically attend.

“They’ve decided they want to declare war on my family and exclude us from the White House, and I just think it’s incredibly petty,” Paul added on Wednesday, saying that White House staffers are “running sort of a paid influencer campaign against me for two weeks on Twitter.”

Advertisement

Paul said his son, daughter-in-law and infant grandson were supposed to attend the picnic with him. He also added that he did not receive an explanation as to why they all were no longer invited, and he’s not sure if the revoked invitation came from Trump or his staffers.

Habeas corpus is “one most fundamental rights we have,” Paul said. “And the same people that are directing this campaign are the same people that casually would throw out parts of the Constitution and suspend habeas corpus. So, I think what it tells it they don’t like hearing me say stuff like that, and so they want to quiet me down. And it hasn’t worked, and so they’re going to try to attack me.”

Paul has drawn Trump’s ire on more than one occasion in recent days. Earlier this month, Paul voiced concerns about Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” prompting Trump to take jabs at him online.

“Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “He loves voting ‘NO’ on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not. The BBB is a big WINNER!!!”

Paul also criticized Trump’s upcoming military parade on Saturday, Trump’s birthday. Paul told HuffPost the parade reminded him of the Soviet Union and North Korea.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt verbally slapped down a reporter for asking whether President Donald Trump would allow peaceful protests during Saturday’s military parade.

On Tuesday, Trump ramped up his language about demonstrators, warning that anyone who protests at his long-awaited event marking the Army’s 250th birthday will be met with “very heavy force.”

Advertisement

So, it was perhaps to be expected that a correspondent would question Leavitt about the president’s remarks at Wednesday’s White House media briefing.

NOTUS White House correspondent Jasmine Wright asked for a clarification on “what kind of protest President Trump does support or find acceptable?”

Leavitt replied that the president “absolutely supports peaceful protests. He supports the First Amendment.”

Advertisement

“He supports the right of Americans to make their voices heard,” she continued. “He does not support violence of any kind. He does not support assaulting law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their job. It’s very clear for the president what he supports and what he does not.”

Wright again sought clarity, asking: “So if there were peaceful protests on Saturday for the military parade, President Trump would allow that?”

Leavitt then gave the reporter short shrift.

“Of course, the president supports peaceful protests,” Leavitt told Wright. “What a stupid question.”

Advertisement

The $45 million parade in Washington, D.C. — which falls on the president’s birthday — is expected to feature a display of military hardware and thousands of soldiers.

Amid nationwide protests against immigration enforcement raids, Trump issued a warning from the Oval Office on Tuesday.

“If there’s any protest that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force, by the way. And for those people that want to protest, they’re gonna be met with very big force,” the president said.

“And I haven’t even heard about a protest — but you know, this is people that hate our country,” he continued. “But they will be met with very heavy force.”

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are at the “only speaking through friends” part of their breakup.

Vice President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles spoke with Musk on the phone last Friday, after which Musk agreed to walk back some of the more explosive claims he made last week, when he and Trump spent the afternoon feuding online.

Advertisement

Sources familiar with the call confirmed to both CNN and The Wall Street Journal that it was intended to de-escalate tensions between the two parties.

On Monday, the tech billionaire dutifully tucked his tail between his legs and published an apology of sorts.

“I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week,” Musk wrote on social media. “They went too far.”

Advertisement

That’s a strikingly different tone than the combative one he adopted last week, when, in a series of escalating social media posts, Musk attacked the president’s signature piece of legislation for growing the deficit by $2.4 trillion; called for Trump’s impeachment; mulled over starting his own political party; and said the reason the Jeffrey Epstein files haven’t been released is because Trump is in them.

Epstein, a wealthy financier, died in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges in 2019.

“Mark this post for the future,” Musk said in a follow-up to the Epstein charge. “The truth will come out.”

Musk has since deleted the post.

While the former “first buddies” appear to have patched things up a bit, a full rapprochement likely remains out of the question.

“Daily Show” correspondent Desi Lydic roasted Rep. Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) Tuesday after his not-safe-for-work gaffe while naming a law that experts warn may complicate Donald Trump’s military deployment to Los Angeles protests.

Lydic warned that Trump sending the military to demonstrations against his immigration policies could put him on the “wrong side of the law” before flagging concerns tied to the Posse Comitatus Act — a law which, with some exceptions, bars troops from engaging in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Lydic called for more details on the “very serious legal principle” before turning to video of Nunn’s wild on-air fumble during a CNN segment.

“Look, I believe strongly in pussy comitatus...,” Nunn appeared to say in the clip.

The comedian, after pausing for laughter and applause from the “Daily Show” crowd, pressed on.

“Indeed, Trump is truly in violation of ‘pussy cum-in-tatas.’ That’s to say nothing of his violations of the Snatch Act,’” she joked.

She went on to emphasize that Trump is taking an “extreme measure” in Los Angeles.

“The last time ‘pussy cum-in-tatas’ was used it was on your mom last night,” quipped Lydic while the sound of an air horn went off.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.

They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.

Advertisement

Kennedy’s decision to “retire” the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors’ groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy’s desire to reassess — and possibly end — longstanding vaccination recommendations.

On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: “We’re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel – not anti-vaxxers – bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.”

The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.

Advertisement

Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he’s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.

He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He’s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.

Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.

Advertisement

Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.

The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC’s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.

The other appointees are:

—Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.

—Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

—Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.

—Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.

Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel.

Advertisement

During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.

Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel’s recommendation and OK’d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.

In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccinations schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Advertisement

ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one “consumer representative” who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.

Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government’s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.

Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.

Advertisement

“If you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you’re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,” Schwartz said.

The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.

Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.

Advertisement

In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.

On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.

A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.

Far-right influencers are calling on Donald Trump’s supporters to boycott Walmart after one of the company’s heirs took out a full-page ad in The New York Times last Sunday promoting the “No Kings” protests planned for the day of Trump’s military parade this weekend.

The ad purchased by Christy Walton, 76, who inherited a 1.9% stake in Walmart from her late husband John Walton and is one of the richest women in the United States, encouraged Trump critics to mobilize against the president’s costly military parade scheduled for Saturday, Forbes reported. It’s similar to another ad she paid for in the Times back in March.

Trump acolytes including far-right influencer Laura Loomer, White House special adviser Kari Lake and Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna all attacked Walton over the ad.

“Looks like the Walmart dynasty is big mad about China Tariffs,” Luna wrote.

Walmart Chief Financial Officer David Rainey warned investors in an interview with CNBC last month that shoppers will likely see higher prices toward the end of May and in June because of Trump’s tariffs.

A spokesperson for Walmart told HuffPost, “the advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,” noting that “she does not serve on the board or play any role in decision making at Walmart.”

“We condemn violence, including when it’s directed towards law enforcement, and the damaging of property,” the spokesperson said before referring to the ongoing protests in LA, where Trump called in the National Guard. “As a company with associates and customers in the Los Angeles region, we remain focused on their safety and that of impacted communities. “

Nonetheless, the far-right account Libs of Chicago and other users with high followings lashed out at Walmart on X, calling for a boycott of the retail chain.

“Sort of ironic isn’t it? A Walton married a socialist,” Libs of Chicago wrote. “If there was ever a time to boycott Walmart, it’s now.”

A representative for Walton sent HuffPost a statement saying the ad was a “personal” message from her meant to people encourage to “engage peacefully and civically” during the Saturday protests, and was unrelated to anti-ICE protests unfolding in Los Angeles.

Walton has “provided no funding to organizations or individuals involved in the demonstrations in Los Angeles or other cities, nor has she provided any funding to those organizing the upcoming events,” the statement said.

“Her interest is simply in encouraging people to listen to one another, participate in their communities, and productively engage on the issues they care about,” the statement continued. “She believes while we have the right to protest, we do not have a right to violence. She condemns violence in all forms and her message promotes civic engagement, peaceful dialogue, and the sharing of diverse views and voices.”

The president, who also used force against protesters in his first term, threatened that anyone who came out to protest the military parade will be met with “very heavy force.”

Disney and NBCUniversal joined forces in the first lawsuit of its kind against the artificial intelligence image company Midjourney on Wednesday, accusing it of copyright infringement.

“We are bringing this action today to protect the hard work of all the artists whose work entertains and inspires us and the significant investment we make in our content,” Kimberly Harris, NBCUniversal’s executive vice president, told CNBC.

The companies’ lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Midjourney sought “to reap the rewards” of Disney and Universal-copyrighted characters by selling an AI image-generating service “that functions as a virtual vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies” of their copyrighted works.

“Midjourney is the quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism,” the lawsuit reads. “Piracy is piracy, and whether an infringing image or video is made with AI or another technology does not make it any less infringing.”

Midjourney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The AI company made $300 million last year from its image service, which allowed subscribers to simply enter a text prompt to request any of the Disney or Universal characters to perform an action, according to the lawsuit. The AI then generates and displays a high-quality image of the character.

The lawsuit lists several Disney or Universal-owned characters Midjourney generated, including Shrek, Darth Vader, Thanos from the “Avengers” series, and the Minions characters from “Despicable Me.”

Horacio Gutierrez, chief legal and compliance officer for The Walt Disney Company, said in a statement to HuffPost that Disney’s “world-class IP is built on decades of financial investment, creativity and innovation—investments only made possible by the incentives embodied in copyright law that give creators the exclusive right to profit from their works.”

He added, “We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly as a tool to further human creativity.”

The lawsuit contends that “Midjourney could easily stop its theft and exploitation” of intellectual property since the AI service controls what copyrighted content it selects.

Advertisement

However, Midjourney chose not to use copyright protection measures, even when Disney and Universal sent cease-and-desist letters, according to the suit.

The lawsuit accuses Midjourney of promoting its AI tools using Disney and Universal characters, and says the AI company has already begun using such characters to train its video service. The companies are now asking for a jury trial to determine damages, which could include some of Midjourney’s profits.

The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman said she doesn’t believe Donald Trump will actually attempt to run for a third term as president.

But she has warned that his allies may try to find other ways to keep him in power beyond 2028.

In an interview with Vanity Fair’s Natalie Korach to promote the updated paperback edition of her 2022 book “Confidence Man: The Making Of Donald Trump And The Breaking Of America,” Haberman noted that Trump has been “encouraging” speculation about a potential third term, even though it’s constitutionally barred.

Trump “clearly enjoys knowing that it bothers Democrats that he says this,” she said, highlighting a “troll aspect” to Trump’s behavior.

“All of his trolls” start like that, Haberman added, likening the strategy to Trump’s ongoing rhetoric about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. “He socializes them,” and “they take on a life of their own,” she added.

Haberman, though, said she’s skeptical Trump will seriously pursue a third term.

“For a variety of reasons, including the fact that he is going to be 80 next year,” she said. Trump turns 79 on Saturday.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will start “phasing out” the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the end of this hurricane season and reduce the amount of federal money that’s given towards disaster relief in the future.

“The FEMA thing has not been a very successful experiment. Very, very expensive and it doesn’t get the job done,” he told reporters from the White House while criticizing the agency’s recent handling of Hurricane Helene, which caused $78.7 billion worth of damage in six states, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Any federal disaster aid will instead come directly from the White House. Exactly who will handle this is not yet certain, he said.

Trump has repeatedly said that states should bear their own recovery costs, and in March he signed an executive order that directs state and local governments to “play a more active and significant role” in preparing for disasters.

“If a certain state, as an example, gets hit by a hurricane or tornado … the governor should be able to handle it. And frankly, if they can’t handle the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor,” Trump said Tuesday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, echoed Trump’s remarks during the press conference, saying removing the agency will “empower governors to go out and respond to emergency situations.”

“People are responsible to respond to their own people closest to home,” she said.

The hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. NOAA has predicted a 60% chance of above-normal hurricane activity.

Local and state governments are already in charge of handling their own natural disasters. FEMA steps in to offer help and reimburse communities for disaster response and recovery projects if it’s requested.

“The locals are in charge of their county and their situation and the state of North Carolina advises FEMA on what we need,” Justin Graney, chief of external affairs for North Carolina Emergency Management, told NPR back in March.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), whose state has experienced four of the nation’s top seven costliest hurricanes, has similarly criticized FEMA’s recent hurricane response, calling its processes too bureaucratic. He expressed indifference on Trump dismantling the agency when questioned by reporters late last month.

“On the core prep, response and then stabilize and get people back to normal, just know that we’ve never relied on FEMA for any of that here in the state of Florida,” he said.

Recent FEMA grants to the state have included over $1 billion given after Hurricane Ian in 2022.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein (D), whose state continues to recover following Hurricane Helene’s devastating hit last fall, has voiced the opposite while urging the agency to be “fixed” rather than destroyed.

“The Governor has been clear on this: Eliminating FEMA would be a man-made disaster; we need FEMA to help us address natural disasters. Let’s work together to improve FEMA so we are ready for future disasters,” a spokesperson for his office told HuffPost on Wednesday.

The amount of money doled out by FEMA has significantly risen over the last decade, but this has been partially blamed on the rising number of catastrophic storms.

Within the last 20 years, the U.S. has experienced its top five costliest storms on record. Hurricane Helene, which ranks seventh in terms of cost, caused $78.7 billion worth of damage in six states, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

The federal government’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which provides FEMA with its funding, has reported its annual spending more than tripling in the years since 2005, when hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma resulted in record aid spending. Prior to 2005, the DRF’s spending averaged about $5 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Stephen A. Smith is once again teasing a potential run for the White House.

The ESPN sports analyst was asked in an interview published Tuesday if he would rather win an Oscar or a presidential election, and while he firmly chose the trophy, Smith hasn’t shut the door on politics — and said some people have already “been trying to coax” him into running.

“I’ve had strategists reaching out to members of my team … so they could talk to me about it,” Smith told The Hollywood Reporter. “Ro Khanna, I will give you that name, is a [progressive Democrat] representative out of California and has spoken publicly about me.”

“Steve Bannon on the right, which I’m not flattered by this, but he’s throwing my name out there,” he continued, referring to the former Donald Trump adviser. “It’s not something I’m pursuing. I just signed a hefty new contract with ESPN. I’m not trying to give up my money. I’m a proud capitalist.”

The clincher: “But I keep my options open because you never know what would happen.”

The sports analyst ultimately acknowledged that he isn’t “qualified to be a politician” and claimed he’s never “had any interest” in being one. He also said America’s political duopoly can’t even “come together for a cup of coffee” and that this has to change.

While Smith decried the poll results at the time as a sign of how “pathetic” the Democratic Party is today, he said Tuesday there’s “nothing but chaos and deprivation in the streets of America” — and spoke like he might want to throw his hat in the ring to change that.

“I’m a moderate, and my objective would be trying to pull both sides closer to the center,” he said. “Let’s stop with the MAGA, right stuff. Let’s stop with the progressive left. Let’s start with everybody from the extremists on the right, to the AOCs and Jasmine Crocketts on the left.”

While Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) are rarely described as “extremists” by non-Republicans, Smith argued that the country must ensure “that the interest of the majority is served instead of surrendering to the fringes.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has admitted to using an artificial intelligence program to help determine which of the documents to declassify about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Addressing a technology conference Tuesday, Gabbard championed the use of AI in helping America’s intelligence services save time and money.

Advertisement

Coming into the role earlier this year, she said, she was confronted with “a deluge of day-to-day tasks and churn” that can “quickly suck up all of the time in the day.” She argued deploying AI to scour top-secret files has been “a game changer.”

In particular, she cited how AI was used by her department to decide which documents should be made public, and used the example of the material related to the assassinations of President Kennedy and his brother New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to declassify documents related to both assassinations, as well as the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., making good on a campaign trail promise. Past attempts to release the records were stymied by internal reviews and redactions.

“We have released thousands, tens of thousands of documents related to the assassinations of JFK and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy,” Gabbard told the Amazon Web Services Summit in Washington, per a transcript on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s website.

“And we have been able to do that through the use of AI tools far more quickly than what was done previously, which is to have humans go through and look at every single one of these pages.”

She added the AI tools were looking for issues “that might be sensitive for living family members to be made aware of.”

Gabbard continued that the intelligence service has been able to aggregate data more quickly by using AI. She pointed to how 10,000 hours of media now takes one person just an hour to process, rather than eight people spending 48 hours combing through the same information.

Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress who switched parties last year, coordinates the work of 18 intelligence agencies.

In March, Trump signaled 80,000 pages related to President Kennedy’s death would be released

The vast majority of the files posted on the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration’s website were previously publicly available.

Some of the unredacted documents released included sensitive personal information such as Social Security numbers.

President Kennedy’s fatal shooting in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, has spawned countless conspiracy theories.

WASHINGTON ― National Institutes of Health director Jayanta Bhattacharya got a cool reception from Democratic and Republican senators on Tuesday as he defended his agency’s budget request for 2026, which would slash billions in cutting-edge biomedical research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and other health conditions.

NIH is considered the crown jewel of American science and the global leader in biomedical research and innovation. Senators in both parties are proud of its success and of their own roles in boosting its funding over the years in support of medical breakthroughs.

So Bhattacharya had to know his budget request would land with a thud as he presented it to a Senate appropriations subcommittee. He kept trying to square two things that didn’t make sense: that Trump is committed to preserving America’s role as the leader in biomedical research, and that his proposed $18 billion in cuts to the agency next year ― or 40% of its entire budget ― won’t hamper that.

Senators didn’t buy it. At times, Bhattacharya didn’t seem to want to defend it, either.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who chairs the full Senate Appropriations Committee, called the administration’s proposed cuts to NIH “so disturbing.”

“It would undo years of congressional investment in NIH, and it would delay or stop effective treatments and cures from being developed for diseases,” Collins said. “We also risk falling behind China and other countries that are increasing their investment in biomedical research.”

Advertisement

In particular, she asked why the administration is calling for the cutting of funding by 40% for the National Institutes of Aging, which funds most Alzheimer’s research, when it’s been successfully developing breakthrough drugs and blood tests.

Bhattacharya, without defending his own proposed cuts, said “the intention” of the Trump administration is to lead the world in biomedical research, suggesting Congress could make a counteroffer and potentially propose more spending.

“The budget is a collaborative effort between the Congress and the administration,” he said.

Collins simply replied, “We look forward to working with you to remedy these problems and the deficiencies in the budget.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the appropriations panel, ripped the administration’s “catastrophic” cuts to NIH to date. She said Trump has so far forced out nearly 5,000 employees, prevented nearly $3 billion in grants from being awarded, and terminated nearly 2,500 grants totaling almost $5 billion for life-saving research.

“The Trump administration is already systematically dismantling the American biomedical research enterprise that is the envy of the world, throwing away billions in economic activity in every one of our states,” Murray fumed. “This budget proposal would effectively forfeit our leadership in research innovation and competitiveness to China.”

She tangled with Bhattacharya over one of dozens of clinical trials that have been halted due to frozen NIH funds: a 23-year research effort to develop an HIV vaccine. Scientists there are on “the cusp of a functional cure for HIV,” she said, and now 6,000 people in that trial have been cut off from treatment.

Bhattacharya jumped in to say he is “absolutely committed” to supporting research on HIV.

“But you did terminate the HIV research at Fred Hutch that, again, was on the cusp of a treatment for 6,000 patients nationwide,” Murray replied, referring to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.

“You did do that,” she said, as they talked over each other.

“I’d have to get back to you on that,” said Bhattacharya.

“You did do that,” she repeated.

After more back and forth, the NIH director said again, “The budget request is a work of negotiation between Congress and the administration.”

Minutes later, he said it yet again, as Murray pressed for details on how many fewer clinical trials there would be next year because of the Trump administration’s proposed cuts.

“I’ll say this,” Bhattacharya declared. “The budget itself is a negotiation between Congress and the administration.”

He said it several other times, too. In fact, it became clear this was the NIH director’s go-to line for defending his own devastating budget request. It simultaneously allowed him to stand by his bosses ― Trump, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ― while not exactly arguing in support of its specific cuts.

“President Trump has committed that the U.S. be the leading nation in biomedicine in the 21st century,” he said at one point. “I entirely support that goal.”

“Well, I do too, but it’s hard to understand how we’re going to get there when the budget slashes funding,” replied Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). “Particularly in critical areas of research where our most critical competitor, the Chinese, are increasing funding in those areas and we’re slashing the budgets.”

Bhattacharya didn’t respond.

It’s possible he may not have agreed with some of his own budget’s cuts. Bhattacharya certainly had a hand in crafting his agency’s budget, but so did other officials at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services. Before becoming NIH director in April, Bhattacharya was a professor of medicine, economics and health research policy at Stanford University. He knows how vital and highly esteemed NIH is, worldwide.

Why not put it on Congress to save it?

“You say this is a collaborative effort, and you’re absolutely right, and I encourage Congress to exert its authorities,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas). “If Congress were to provide additional dollars above and beyond the president’s budget request, how would we as a committee and how would you as NIH recommend for us to prioritize that spending?”

Bhattacharya said he’s focused on the “real health needs” of Americans, like diabetes and cancer, and on the “need to think big” for advancing science.

Advertisement

“Again, the budget, it’s a collaborative effort,” he said. “But I think it’s going to be important that we address the real problems in science and the real needs of the American people with whatever budget comes out. That’s my job.”

Moran redirected Bhattacharya back to the need for more funding at NIH.

“I assume that means we need more resources,” said the Republican senator. “And that you would put them to good use. Is that accurate?”

WASHINGTON – The American Bar Association on Tuesday responded to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s stunning decision to cut the organization out of the process of vetting President Donald Trump’s nominees to lifetime federal judgeships, calling the move “deeply disturbing” and unprecedented.

In a lengthy letter to Bondi, ABA president William Bay refutes several accusations she made last month about the nonpartisan organization being an “activist group” that invariably favors judicial nominees put forward by Democratic presidents.

“The ABA is both surprised and disappointed that the Justice Department has decided for the first time in 72 years to (a) block access by the Standing Committee to judicial nominees and (b) to restrict access of the Standing Committee to information that is relevant in evaluating judicial nominees,” Bay said.

“The changes the Justice Department is apparently imposing will likely result in less transparency in the process of confirming nominees to lifetime appointments on the federal bench and appear to be based on incorrect information set forth in your letter,” he said.

Bay said the ABA has always occupied a unique rule in vetting judicial nominees because nobody else does “the type of in-depth, independent evaluation” the association does. Among other things, the ABA extensively reviews a nominee’s past legal writings, routinely interviews dozens of judges and lawyers who know a given nominee and conducts an extensive interview with each nominee.

Advertisement

Bay emphasized that ABA, which is America’s main legal organization, doesn’t advocate for any nominees or evaluate any nominees’ ideologies. It keeps its evaluations confidential and, he argued, it has a public service responsibility to the Senate and the general public.

“Your statements that the ABA is an activist organization and the suggestions that what the ABA may or may not support somehow permeates the ratings process are unsupported by the facts,” Bay told Bondi.

He added, “It is deeply disturbing that the Justice Department has decided to restrict access to judicial nominees without justification or basis.”

On top of everything, the ABA president says he never even got Bondi’s letter. He read about it on social media and is still waiting to receive it.

“We await receipt of the letter sent to us by your office,” he said.

Here’s a copy of Bay’s letter to Bondi:

So far in his second term, Trump has only nominated five people to lifetime federal judgeships. They more or less fit the bill of his first-term court picks: They all have records of attacking abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and civil rights. They’re all white. They’ve all faced condemnation from progressive and nonpartisan groups for being too ideologically extreme.

True crime is where our audience went and we met it there with, I like to think, an arsenal of journalistic talents: expert storytelling that captures victims, families and killers in all their human, complicated glory; the highest standards of fairness; and maybe just as important as anything else, true respect for the lives that are taken and the loved ones left behind.

Still, I admit the subject matter is dark. Nearly every episode involves a murder, or at least a disappearance. We do some powerful stories about the wrongfully convicted, but those people are usually convicted of killing someone. Death almost always figures into what happened in one way or another.

I work on the “open” of the show: the minute and a half at the top that highlights the most dramatic parts of the story. It includes things like: how many hearts the victim touched, how shocking the crime was, and how depraved the killer’s actions were. In short, it’s made up of the saddest, starkest, most potent stuff. Like my colleagues in this strange, very particular universe, I have developed an eye for small moments that reveal deep emotion, whether it’s anger or grief. And I’ve written the words “a chilling discovery,” “a savage assault,” and “a bizarre twist” more times than I care to count.

So, yes … dark. And, of course, heartbreakingly sad.

But depressing? No.

Many of our greatest and most popular writers — including Stephen King, Gillian Flynn, Edgar Allen Poe and Agatha Christie, to name just a few — wrestle almost exclusively with sinister themes, like violence and murder. People don’t tend to think of their work as “depressing.” Spine-tingling? Yes. As well as engaging. Thought-provoking.

I would argue one of the reasons great writers engage with this material is that the stakes in a murder mystery are so high. A human life is taken. In Michael Cunningham’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Hours,” Virginia Woolf says, “Someone has to die in order that the rest of us should value life more. It’s contrast.”

But dark stories offer a flip side as well: the possibility for redemption, hope and understanding. This is such a fundamental paradigm that it resonates even with children. Studies show that fairy tales, many of which are scary, help children process difficult emotions like fear, envy and loneliness. This reassures children that they are not alone and that they’re “normal.” Fairy tales give children a safe place to explore these feelings and can teach them how to express and deal with them in an effective, constructive way.

For grown-up readers, different kinds of mysteries may offer different kinds of sustenance. In an astute essay for Time magazine, award-winning novelist Tana French argues these stories mostly fall into one of two camps. The first, like those written by Christie, are about restoring order and seeing justice meted out. Her offerings are tidy, self-contained, feature a satisfying resolution — and go perfectly with a cup of tea. “In a world that can often be chaotic and reasonless, we need these stories,” French writes.

Others, which French dubs “wild mysteries,” ask us to engage with deeper questions about human nature. “What are we capable of? How much of who we are is determined by choice, by circumstance, or by nature?” French asks. “The questions stay unanswered because they’re unanswerable.”

I like to think “Dateline” gives viewers a bit of both kinds of stories. By the end of the hour, you will (almost always) know who committed the crime. You will know how. You will usually know why. But we take on the deeper, thornier questions, too, like how well do we ever really know another person — even one we’re married to? Can a person simply snap? And, in an increasingly complicated world, what constitutes justice?

I know some people say that shows like “Dateline” serve up the trauma and pain of real people for the entertainment of our viewers. But the show’s producers tell me that the victims’ loved ones say talking about the case provides a kind of balm. They refer to their experience working with “Dateline” as cathartic and say it leaves them feeling “lighter.” They feel like someone “important” is really listening to them and they trust that we will take their story seriously and tell it correctly. It can be a truly transformative experience for them.

One producer also told me that “Dateline” creates “an important historical record of serious crime. Something that people can always look back on to see what really happened, told by the people it happened to.” In these times of rampant mis- and disinformation, this is no small thing.

I believe our stories also resonate with viewers because, though the terrible people are truly terrible, the heroes we feature really are heroic — whether it’s the detective who picks up the ice cold case and keeps digging until she finds the truth or the prosecutor who refuses to give up on the impossible-to-prove case or the sister whose hands grow raw from putting up “missing” posters.

These people’s resilience struck me in an especially personal way several years ago. Though I’m fortunate to never have experienced violent crime, my mother died when I was a child. One otherwise-unremarkable day, I realized that I was older than she was when she passed. I thought I’d made my peace with her death years earlier, but on that day I was suddenly acutely aware of just how little time she’d been given on this planet. I was stewing in the sour juice of helplessness, bitterness and sadness when I started working on my next “Dateline” story. As I began to go through the interview tapes to find the best soundbites, I found myself appreciating the friends and family members of the victim in a way I never had before. They had confronted the most terrible thing life could throw at them and somehow kept going in surprising, inspiring ways.

The same is true of the loved ones in most of our “Dateline” stories. Some of these people have actually helped solve cases. Others have found inventive ways to help other families going through similar trauma. But no matter what they’ve experienced, there’s one thing they all share: Despite any apprehension about becoming public people — which in this day and age can be unpleasant or even dangerous — they went on national TV to make sure we knew who their murdered cousin, aunt or friend was. They spoke up to keep their memories alive.

Their unbelievable strength has moved and healed me. I now carry some of their words around with me, like an aspirin for a headache, or a railing when I feel wobbly.

I work on a program that some have called “The Murder Show.” They’re not wrong, but maybe toiling in a dark world makes the light more visible. Maybe it’s only because of sadness that we even know and understand joy. Maybe it’s injustice that allows us to appreciate justice.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latine-chefs-mixologists-resist-anti-immigrant-rhetoric_n_68485248e4b0682b100c248c,"In restaurants and bars across the country, a generation of Latines in the hospitality industry are quietly but powerfully resisting erasure. With intention and authenticity, these culinary visionaries are reshaping narratives about Latinidad — on their own terms. And that’s especially important today, in a political climate where anti-immigrant rhetoric echoes louder each election cycle.

Regardless of your position in the hierarchy of power, resistance is key. And bringing your authentic self to work every day not only enriches the community but proves to bigots that our voices — and our flavors, our influence and our values — will not be silenced. We spoke with industry tastemakers about how they’re getting creative with their recipes and claiming their space in the process.

At Lala, a restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico, co-owned by Bad Bunny and recently named one of Time magazine’s “greatest places,” Chef Guillermo López Folch breaks out of the box Latine chefs are often confined to, bringing a wealth of experience from some of the world’s top kitchensv — including over a decade at Michelin-starred restaurant Le Bernardin in New York.

Now back on the island, he channels that pedigree into a space that blends precision with rebellion. “I’m not going to please everyone, and that’s OK. You’ve got to stay true to what you believe. That’s the most Puerto Rican thing about us. We never back down,” López Folch tells HuffPost.

Advertisement

The temptation to “Americanize” dishes? He laughs.

“No, never,” López Folch says. “Sometimes we push aside what we eat daily, downplaying it — like arroz con salchichas — and then we realize it’s actually gold. That’s our soul food.”

Advertisement

His perspective is deeply rooted in both identity and humility. “We never opened Lala thinking we’d end up [with multiple accolades.] But maybe that’s the point—we’re not trying to impress, just express,” he says. “Just by showing up and doing what we do, sin miedo, we make our point.”

The spirit, equally infused by Bad Bunny, whose birth name is Benito Martínez Ocasio, is part of a wider cultural movement — one rooted in radical authenticity. “Benito always says, you gotta be you,” López Folch says. “He puts plastic chairs from la casa de abuela in his album and doesn’t care if people don’t get it. That’s power.”

As political rhetoric grows increasingly anti-immigrant, López Folch leans into the quiet resistance of his craft. “We’re living through a time that we can’t even compare to anything in the past, so it’s always important to express who you are, where you come from,” he says. “That’s the beauty of this industry — it unites people.”

Advertisement

And sometimes, that unity starts with a single bite. “A good plate of food disarms whoever,” he explains. “They might be angry at you, but then they take a bite and go, ‘Shit, this is delicious.’” For López Folch, that moment of shared humanity is enough, adding, “That’s how we speak.”

Carol Reyes

At first glance, Bóveda doesn’t fit the mold of a Latine restaurant — and that’s exactly the point. Chef Carol Reyes, recently nominated for a 2025 James Beard Award in the Best Chef: South category, is carving out a different lane. Her food isn’t traditional fare; it’s refined, seasonal, and minimalist. But her ingredients are local, her flavors intentional, and her purpose deeply rooted in identity.

“My food isn’t defined by geography. It’s defined by technique. My cuisine isn’t about pleasing everyone,” Reyes says. “If I start doing what Americans like just to satisfy them, I stop being me. My cuisine loses its essence.”

It’s a bold stance, especially in a moment when the pressure to conform —culturally, commercially, and politically — is so high. But Reyes doesn’t see resistance as performative. For her, it’s about presence. “We’re not in the United States,” she says of Puerto Rico, “but we’re Latino. We’re rubbing shoulders with the rest. Being nominated alongside chefs from across the U.S. shows that we are on the same level. And as a woman, even more so.”

She also believes gastronomy can be a form of protest, even if it’s subtle. “Chefs are ambassadors. Food defines a country. And if I’m doing my job right, then every plate that leaves my kitchen says something about who we are as Puerto Ricans.”

“You’ll be surprised by the amount of Ecuadorians that right now we have in the New York market that I’m taking not only bartender positions, but leadership positions,” says chef and mixologist Marcelo Chasi, who was born and raised in Ecuador. “So it’s great to see. I love that.”

Chasi, who is also a brand ambassador of Herradura tequila, stressed the importance of bringing your most authentic self to work every day, especially if you’re responsible for setting the tone of a hospitality space. “Depending on the focus of the event, we want to introduce people to fun elements that they might not be familiar with,” he says, describing how even a cocktail can transport you. “Recently, I featured a clarified cocktail with Herradura reposado that was made with banana. Ecuador is a country known for bananas, and we have signature drinks that feature it.” Incorporating simple yet emblematic flavors is one way Chasi says he literally brings his culture to the bar.

And while Chasi is hell bent on a good time, he expresses that the table management (as he calls it) was raised with — and how important it is to honor the ritual of eating and drinking. Intentional eating and drinking, for him, means taking your time to taste the ingredients and savor the entire experience.

Today, regardless of what space Chasi is in, making connections is crucial. “I like to acknowledge and greet everyone in the room individually,” he says. “That’s something very important, because you don’t generalize people. You make it personal.”

For Hugo Gamino, food isn’t just sustenance — it’s survival, storytelling, and an act of defiance. Based in Phoenix, Arizona, and serving as head of culinary strategy at Hispanic Kitchen, Gamino draws a direct line between his plates and his Mexican heritage. “My cuisine dates back to the Mesoamericans, told in a modern way,” he says. “A reflection of my Mexican roots, my food is a lifeline to who made me and what I want to keep alive.”

Early in his career, Gamino admits, he faced pressure to “Americanize” his dishes to gain a seat at the table. “As a young chef, I allowed persuasion to alter my menu. But as I’ve aged, I’ve realized the privileged never alter themselves. Now, I meet their privilege with the transparent, authentic dishes my ancestors passed to me.”

Gamino feels an acute responsibility to use his platform to highlight the immigrant story.

“Now more than ever, our cuisine is crucial. When I cook, I’m telling a story — not just my own, but of my people. My success was built on the sacrifices of immigrants in my family. I don’t allow my food to be a holiday or a month; I cook bolder and as authentically as I can.”

Advertisement

For Gamino, food is indisputably political. “I’m an activist who happens to write and cook. My dishes are a vessel for justice,” he says. As the son of immigrants, he sees every meal as an opportunity to counter stereotypes and showcase the resilience and values of his community. He explains, “Food has allowed me to show a transparent viewpoint of who we really are.”

Mario Pagán

As the host of the inaugural Puerto Rico Wine and Food Festival and the visionary behind acclaimed restaurants like Mario Pagán and Chayote in Winter Park, Florida, Chef Mario Pagán doesn’t just cook Latine food; he redefines it. His cuisine, a “modern twist on Puerto Rican flavors,” weaves together the Caribbean’s depth with contemporary techniques. Dishes like his ropa vieja lasagna challenge expectations of what our food can be.

Pagán reframes the concept of fusion by acknowledging our right to experiment with food. “Yes, I’ve Americanized some of my dishes. But it’s about delivery and storytelling — simplifying our caldos and sancochos without stripping away their meaning,” he says. His success shows that adaptation doesn’t have to mean assimilation.

Pagán views his role as both chef and cultural torchbearer. “We are a major force in the United States, especially in Florida,” he says. “Even when my restaurant isn’t explicitly Puerto Rican, everyone knows I’m Puerto Rican. The food reflects that.”

You’ve probably seen Ming-Na Wen wielding a sword, outsmarting enemies or saving the galaxy — often all at once. The actor has spent decades portraying warriors, leaders and legends across some of the world’s biggest franchises, from Disney’s “Mulan” to Marvel’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to “The Mandalorian.”

But in her latest role as Dr. Fong in “Karate Kid: Legends,” Wen reveals a different kind of strength — one rooted in grief, compassion and the quiet determination of a mother trying to protect what’s left of her family.

Advertisement

“Dr. Fong was really well written, even though she was a supporting role,” Wen told HuffPost. “There was so much that I could infuse [from] my own experience as a mom for the last 24 years of my life.” (Watch the full interview above.)

In “Karate Kid: Legends,” which hit theaters on May 30, 2025, Wen plays the mother of the film’s lead, Li Fong. After the death of Li’s older brother — who was fatally stabbed following a martial arts tournament — Dr. Fong makes the difficult decision to uproot their lives. She accepts a job in New York City and moves Li across the country, asking him to give up martial arts entirely. While her actions are meant to safeguard her son after unimaginable loss, they’re misconstrued as an attempt to dictate his life.

For Wen, 61, the opportunity to portray an Asian mother who isn’t defined by stereotypical rigidity was not only rare — it was long overdue. Over the years, Hollywood has often leaned into narrow depictions of Asian moms: strict, stoic and overbearing. But Dr. Fong, Wen says, pushes against that trope. She’s thoughtful. Grieving. Protective, yes — but not controlling.

“We were both on the same page about not making Dr. Fong into this sort of Tiger Mom,” Wen explains. “You want to be able to feel this person and where her heart is. That was one of my [focuses] — and of course, dealing with grief. And in a lot of ways, Asians, we don’t like to cry in front of people. There’s this kind of quiet dignity that she has as she’s dealing with her personal loss.”

That quiet resilience, Wen says, is more than just a character trait — it’s a reflection of many real-life immigrant experiences, including her own. “I had a very strong mother,” Wen tells me, explaining that she is “still struggling with the language, and her own acceptance of certain things that are very American, like where everything is open, you hug each other all the time, you say, ‘I love you.’ She never used to say those things.”

Advertisement

Wen also drew inspiration from her mother-in-law. “I didn’t want Dr. Fong to have an accent, because my mother-in-law doesn’t have an accent. ... Why are we still playing roles where we have to have these stereotypical accents? I wanted to showcase a more modern take. And not have anyone question it, either.”

By making that choice, the film’s portrayal of Asian American characters moves beyond a single narrative of the immigrant experience and instead reflects a broader, more nuanced spectrum of identities and backgrounds.

It’s that blend of authenticity and intentionality that makes Wen’s portrayal feel groundbreaking. But for her, representation isn’t just about visibility — it’s about emotional connection.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/indigenous-storytelling-set-design-reservation-dog_n_683f40bee4b016ce65683a5b,"During the past five years, there has been a welcome surge of insight into contemporary Indigenous culture through TV and film. That crucial storytelling happens not just through honest dialogue and scripts helmed by Indigenous writers, but also in how we see characters living onscreen. It’s in what their homes look like and the cultural pieces that emphasize their values. All of it matters, and all of it is intentional.

If you have watched the Emmy-nominated TV show “Reservation Dogs” and the Lily Gladstone–led film “Fancy Dance,” you’re already familiar with Tafv Sampson’s work. The Muscogee set designer is known for creating authentic, lived-in scenery that feels like home for the Indigenous actors on set and welcomes viewers into the featured tribal communities. The characters she develops tend to become one with their surroundings, and that’s by design.

“With ‘Rez Dogs,’ we were making something in a real community, which is pretty rare in TV and film,” says Sampson, who even took an acting turn on the show. “Working with all these people in the community and bringing their special objects into the set made me think about why these things are so important to us. We hold onto these relics that are passed down generation after generation so we can share them and tell stories about them.” For her, the oral tradition so integral to Native cultures is fueled by these pieces.

Sampson’s visual storytelling is also at times bolstered by personal belongings contributed by the production’s cast and crew members. Memorable instances include the “Rez Dogs” Season 2 episode “Mabel,” which follows a grieving teen processing the loss of her grandmother and features blankets, photographs, and other family heirlooms to reflect a life well-lived and an elder well-loved. These seemingly simple objects infuse scenes with energy and meaning.

Those artfully incorporated details delight even directors, who often aren’t interacting with Sampson all that much beyond brainstorming sessions. “One of my favorite moments working with Tafv on ‘Fancy Dance’ was entering this home where an older person lived and discovering a Big Gulp cup sitting on the table with this piece of chewed gum on top,” says Seneca–Cayuga writer and director Erica Tremblay, who was named to HuffPost’s 2023 Culture Shifters list.

“She thinks about even the tiniest minutiae of what a space should be and fills it with these thoughtful details,” Tremblay adds. “So even though the camera may never actually see that level of detail, it creates this environment for your actors to inhabit, take signals from, and communicate with — it really affects their understanding of their own characters.”

That level of intentionality has earned Sampson accolades as well as abundant admiration from Native creatives and audiences alike. Throughout it all, her goal has been to enhance representation while upholding a family tradition in film. Sampson’s grandfather, the trailblazing Muscogee actor Will Sampson, and her late father, actor and activist Tim Sampson, both brought authenticity to their careers, subtly informing non-Natives about Indigenous culture through their craft.

Working on these shows set and shot in Oklahoma, where the Muscogee people settled after being forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands and enduring the Trail of Tears, has given Sampson a deeper connection to her community and her culture (she grew up in Portland and Los Angeles). Although she never met her grandpa — he died two years before she was born — his legacy looms large in the Sooner State.

“Because I didn’t grow up in [the Muscogee] community, I didn’t hear much about him other than family stories,” Sampson says. “But since I’ve started spending more time in Oklahoma, everyone comes up to me to talk about him. It makes me so proud — and also gives me a lot to live up to.”

She recently wrapped a six-month stint in Oklahoma working on “The Lowdown,” a new crime noir show from “Rez Dogs” showrunner Sterlin Harjo (Muscogee/Seminole) set to debut in September. Like Tremblay, Harjo entrusted Sampson with the ability to create these worlds.

“We don’t even have to talk too much about things — she just understands it,” Harjo says. “There’s a spirituality and an energy to her design work that permeates the story and the characters. It gives the story something firm to stand on. Everyone feels it, and the actors and crew tell the story better and work harder because of the care and specificity that Tafv brings to her work.”

In addition to set decorating, she’s also finishing a screenplay that her father started, based on his time at the Sequoyah Indian boarding school. Sampson is also in the process of launching a company to highlight Native artisans through limited-edition collaborations.

A scan of my Gmail account indicated I have received more than 50,000 messages in the 10.1 years I've used the service. Immersion identified 189 collaborators, and it predicted how many new collaborators I would have this year, as well as the number of messages I would send and receive through the rest of 2014.

Email metadata is easy to access but difficult to delete. MakeUseOf's Guy McDowell explains how to view header information in Gmail messages, and how to decipher the metadata that gets attached to your mail. The eDiscovery Evangelist explains all the types of metadata that are included with your messages and includes a link to the metadata definition in the Internet standards document RFC 2822.

As The Guardian's Guide to Metadata explains, there's not much you can do about most of the metadata associated with an email, apart from disabling location services on your phone. However, you can remove metadata from the files you attach to emails. Here's a guide to deleting metadata from Office files, PDFs, and images.

Strip the metadata from your files

Microsoft offers the free Document Inspector for removing ""personal or sensitive information"" before you share an Office file. The Microsoft Support site provides specific information on deleting metadata from Word 2013 and Word 2010; Excel 2013 and Excel 2010; PowerPoint 2013 and PowerPoint 2010; Word 2007, Excel 2007, and PowerPoint 2007; and Word 2003, Excel 2003, and PowerPoint 2003.

Likewise, Adobe's Help site explains how to remove metadata from PDFs in Acrobat X Pro and Acrobat X Standard. A thread on B4Print.com's forum provides step-by-step instructions for excising metadata, or ""hidden content,"" from PDFs using the Examine Document tool in Acrobat 9.

Windows Explorer (File Explorer in Windows 8.1) lets you view and delete metadata from a file via the Properties dialog box. The quickest way is to click Properties > Details > Remove Properties and Personal Information > ""Create a copy with all possible properties removed.""

However, as MakeUseOf's Chris Hoffman points out, this method may not work when you try to clean the EXIF metadata from image files. Hoffman recommends the free Metability QuickFix program for removing GPS data from multiple photos at once.

Another metadata-removal tool for Windows image files is the free JPEG & PNG Stripper from Steel Bytes. Mac OS X users can delete EXIF data from image files by using the free ImageOptim program, as described on OS X Daily.

Photography Life's Nasim Mansurov explains how to remove EXIF and XMP data from files in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Mansurov's tutorial includes a link to Phil Harvey's free ExifTool.

Don't tag your location to your phone's photos

Facebook, Twitter, and other social sites and image-sharing services automatically hide the location information and other metadata attached to the images you upload to prevent viewers from downloading the information along with the photo. However, you're still sharing the data with the service itself. Maybe you're OK with that, and maybe you'd prefer to prevent the services from knowing where you were when you took the photo.

To disable location services for the camera in an iPhone or iPad, choose Settings > Privacy > Location services and toggle Camera to off.

As Martin Brinkmann explains on the gHacks site, the simplest way to remove GPS data from images on Android phones is to use the free Image Privacy app, which adds a ""Strip metadata"" option to the Android Share menu. After you select the option, the menu reappears following a short delay. Now when you select a service (Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Flickr, etc.), the image is uploaded minus its location data.

Another option for removing location information from images is the free VerExif.com service. (Note that the site opens in Spanish by default but can also be viewed in English.) Select the Choose File option, navigate to and select an image, and click Open. You can either remove the EXIF data or view it; the remove option also appears on the view screen.

VerExif.com works on only one image file at a time, unlike the programs referenced above that let you remove location information from multiple image files at one time.",Technology

Brian Wilson, one of the founding members of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82.

“We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,” a statement on Wilson’s Instagram reads. “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy”

Wilson’s death comes about a year and a half after his wife, Melinda Ledbetter, died. Ledbetter was often credited with getting Wilson healthy after he was under the controversial “24-hour therapy” of psychologist Eugene Landy.

Wilson’s family didn’t specify how Wilson died. He had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder, and since 1965 had regularly experienced auditory hallucinations.

In 2024, a judge found that Wilson should be put in a conservatorship because of his “major neurocognitive disorder.”

The creative driving force behind the Beach Boys, Wilson wrote and co-wrote what would become some of the most memorable songs in U.S. history during his life. All told, Wilson had his hand in more than two dozen Top 40 hits over the course of his life, most of which came in the 1960s, including “Good Vibrations,” “Surfin’ U.S.A.,” “Fun, Fun, Fun,” “I Get Around” and “Barbara Ann.”

“I wanted to write joyful music that would make other people feel good,” Wilson said during The Beach Boys’ induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. “That’s what I tried to do.”

But there is little question that Wilson’s enduring legacy will be 1966’s “Pet Sounds,” the album Rolling Stone once proclaimed to be the second best of all time. Wilson was inspired to write “Pet Sounds” after hearing The Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” which opened his eyes to what a fully formed album could be. Wilson later said he told himself, “If I ever do anything in my life, I’m going to make that good an album.”

In Paul McCartney’s eyes, he did. The former Beatle has said that “Pet Sounds” has repeatedly brought him to tears throughout his life, and he counts one of the tracks on it, the simultaneously soothing and complex “God Only Knows,” as his favorite song of all time. “No one’s musical education is complete without hearing that album,” McCartney once said.

Just as “Rubber Soul” pushed Wilson to make “Pet Sounds,” “Pet Sounds” pushed the Beatles to make perhaps their most famous album: “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”

“Without ‘Pet Sounds,’ ‘Sgt. Pepper’ never would have happened,” Beatles producer George Martin once said. “‘Pepper’ was an attempt to equal ‘Pet Sounds.’”

Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, in Inglewood, California, and raised in the nearby city of Hawthorne by his parents, Murry Wilson and Audree Neva. The oldest of three boys, all of whom would eventually join the Beach Boys, Brian was physically and emotionally abused by his father from a young age.

“I had a good childhood — except for my dad beating me up all the time,” he once said.

But Wilson and his two brothers, Dennis and Carl, nevertheless came to adopt their father’s love of music in spite of his abuse and Brian’s near-deafness in one ear. Together, they learned to harmonize in the living room and eventually formed a band called the Pendletones, which their label later renamed the Beach Boys, even though Brian didn’t know how to surf.

Thus began a prolific half-decade of Wilson’s writing career. Between 1962 and 1967, when Brian was in his early 20s, The Beach Boys released 13 albums in total and enjoyed massive success. But the lifestyle took its toll on Wilson, who suffered a nervous breakdown while touring in 1964 ― the same year he married his first wife, Marilyn Rovell ― and would go on to struggle with both drug and alcohol abuse and “schizoaffective disorder, which is ... manic depressive with auditory hallucinations,” as his second wife, Ledbetter, later described it.

It was in this way that one of the Beach Boys’ albums, “Smile,” didn’t see the light of day for 37 years, leading to decades of whispers, wonder, theories and gossip. Asked in 2011 why “Smile” took so long to put out, Wilson replied in his usual laconic manner, “Because we were on drugs and we didn’t really know how to finish it.”

By the 1970s, Wilson’s life, let alone his career, was in shambles. His weight ballooned to more than 300 pounds as he struggled with addiction and became a recluse in his California home for several years. According to Biography.com, Wilson could sometimes be spotted at clubs in the city, not in his right mind and wearing only a bathrobe and slippers.

Soon after, Landy came into Wilson’s life, employing the controversial “24-hour therapy” regimen that got Wilson off drugs but made him utterly dependent on Landy, who came to dominate Wilson’s life both creatively and financially.

Eventually, Wilson’s family had to sue Landy in the early 1990s to obtain a restraining order against the psychologist, who subsequently handed over his license. (Wilson and Landy’s relationship is portrayed in the critically acclaimed 2015 film “Love & Mercy,” named after his 1988 solo song.)

In the 34 years since his legal separation from Landy, Wilson’s general condition improved. He married Ledbetter in 1995. He was father to seven children: Carnie and Wendy of Wilson Phillips fame from his first marriage, along with five children he adopted with Ledbetter.

Advertisement

Wilson released a series of solo albums over the years, and in 2004, he finally unveiled “Smile” to widespread critical acclaim. That year, while talking with Larry King, Wilson said, “I’ve got a happy life ... I’m not as depressed as I was. I get depressed now and then, but not very much anymore.”

Despite suffering from lifelong stage fright, Wilson started to tour once again, his calming harmonies filling the air and soothing both the audience’s pain and his own.

Ye has apparently switched up his moniker yet again, nearly four years after he legally renounced his birth name, Kanye Omari West.

In business documents obtained by multiple outlets on Tuesday, the rapper was listed under the name “Ye Ye.” West’s chief financial officer, Hussain Lalani, reportedly filed the documents with the California Secretary of State.

“Ye Ye” was listed as the “manager or member” of West’s companies Yeezy Apparel, Yeezy Record Label and Ox Paha Inc. in the documents, according to E! News.

It’s unclear whether the “Power” musician, who has not publicly announced his new moniker, has filed separate documents to legally change his name again.

Ye’s representatives did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

In October 2021, a Los Angeles judge approved the 24-time Grammy winner’s petition to officially change his name to Ye after he requested the name change in August.

Brooke Shields admitted in a recent podcast that she once interrupted Meghan Markle during a panel over a story that was “so serious,” and now the episode apparently has been deleted.

The actor, 60, made the admission while chatting with King Charles’ goddaughter India Hicks during an episode of the latter’s podcast, which was released earlier this month. The podcast is no longer visible on Hick’s website, multiple outlets reported.

During the episode, Shields reflected on a SXSW panel led by Katie Couric that she and Meghan participated in. The panel, “Breaking Barriers, Shaping Narratives: How Women Lead On and Off the Screen,” took place back in March 2024. (Watch video of the panel here and skip to about the 6:30 mark for the comments in question.)

But according to the “Mother of the Bride” star, her interaction with the Duchess of Sussex didn’t quite go according to plan.

Recalling that Markle told a story during the panel that involved her writing a letter “advocating for women” at the age of 11, Shields told Hicks that she found the “Suits” actor’s anecdote to be out of place and too “serious.”

“Katie asks the first question to Meghan and [she] talks about how at a young age, she was already advocating for women,” Shields began. “She starts talking and telling a story about how when she was 11 — and she keeps saying, ‘Well, when I was 11, I saw this commercial and they were talking about how washing dishes … was for women.’”

“And [Markle] said, ‘I didn’t think only women wash dishes. It wasn’t fair. So I wrote to the company,’” Shields continued. “She kept saying she was 11! She [wrote] some company, they changed the text, they changed the commercial.”

Shields claimed that she interrupted Markle’s story in an effort to uplift the mood of the panel.

“I go, ‘Excuse me, I’m so sorry, I’ve just got to interrupt you there for one minute,’” Shields recalled telling Markle. “I was trying not to be rude, but I wanted to be funny because it was so serious.”

Advertisement

Shields said she then cracked a joke to the audience, telling them, “I just want to give everybody here a context as to how we’re different. When I was 11, I was playing a prostitute.”

Her joke was in reference to her lead role in 1978′s “Pretty Baby” — a film based on a young girl who was sexually exploited by being forced into prostitution by her mother at the age of 12.

“The [venue] went insane and then luckily it was more relaxed after that,” Shields added.

The “That’s ’70s Show” alum told Hicks that at the time she hoped Markle didn’t consider her actions to be “rude.”

Advertisement

“I was like ‘I hope she doesn’t think I’m rude. I’m not being rude.’ It was just too precious, and I was like, [the audience is] not going to want to sit here for 45 minutes and listen to anybody be precious or serious,” Shields explained.

HuffPost has reached out to reps for Shields and Markle for comment.

Social media users on X, formerly Twitter, shared mixed reactions over the reportedly deleted clip online.

Stephen A. Smith is once again teasing a potential run for the White House.

The ESPN sports analyst was asked in an interview published Tuesday if he would rather win an Oscar or a presidential election, and while he firmly chose the trophy, Smith hasn’t shut the door on politics — and said some people have already “been trying to coax” him into running.

“I’ve had strategists reaching out to members of my team … so they could talk to me about it,” Smith told The Hollywood Reporter. “Ro Khanna, I will give you that name, is a [progressive Democrat] representative out of California and has spoken publicly about me.”

“Steve Bannon on the right, which I’m not flattered by this, but he’s throwing my name out there,” he continued, referring to the former Donald Trump adviser. “It’s not something I’m pursuing. I just signed a hefty new contract with ESPN. I’m not trying to give up my money. I’m a proud capitalist.”

The clincher: “But I keep my options open because you never know what would happen.”

The sports analyst ultimately acknowledged that he isn’t “qualified to be a politician” and claimed he’s never “had any interest” in being one. He also said America’s political duopoly can’t even “come together for a cup of coffee” and that this has to change.

While Smith decried the poll results at the time as a sign of how “pathetic” the Democratic Party is today, he said Tuesday there’s “nothing but chaos and deprivation in the streets of America” — and spoke like he might want to throw his hat in the ring to change that.

“I’m a moderate, and my objective would be trying to pull both sides closer to the center,” he said. “Let’s stop with the MAGA, right stuff. Let’s stop with the progressive left. Let’s start with everybody from the extremists on the right, to the AOCs and Jasmine Crocketts on the left.”

While Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) are rarely described as “extremists” by non-Republicans, Smith argued that the country must ensure “that the interest of the majority is served instead of surrendering to the fringes.”

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marines-los-angeles-national-guard-detain_n_684a5371e4b0cf5f0c9b1d25,"LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Marines will join National Guard troops on the streets of Los Angeles within two days, officials said on Wednesday, and would be authorized to detain anyone who interferes with immigration officers on raids or protesters who confront federal agents.

U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the deployments over the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom, sparking a national debate about the use of the military on U.S. soil and animating protests that have spread from Los Angeles to other major cities, including New York, Atlanta and Chicago.

Los Angeles on Wednesday endured a sixth day of protests that have been largely peaceful but occasionally punctuated by violence, mostly contained to a few blocks of the city’s downtown area.

The protests broke out last Friday in response to a series of immigration raids. Trump in turn called in the National Guard on Saturday, then summoned the Marines on Monday.

“If I didn’t act quickly on that, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground right now,” said Trump at an event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

State and local leaders dispute that, saying Trump has only escalated tensions with an unnecessary and illegal deployment of federal troops, while Democrats nationally have condemned his action as authoritarian.

Trump is carrying out a campaign promise to deport immigrants, employing forceful tactics consistent with the norm-breaking political style that got him elected twice.

“President Trump promised to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history and left-wing riots will not deter him in that effort,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

The U.S. military said on Wednesday that a battalion of 700 Marines had concluded training specific to the L.A. mission, including de-escalation and crowd control. They would join National Guard under the authority of a federal law known as Title 10 within 48 hours, not to conduct civilian policing but to protect federal officers and property, the military said.

“Title 10 forces may temporarily detain an individual in specific circumstances such as to stop an assault, to prevent harm to others, or to prevent interference with federal personnel performing their duties,” the Northern Command said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “If any rioters attack ICE law enforcement officers, military personnel have the authority to temporarily detain them until law enforcement makes the arrest.”

U.S. Army Major General Scott Sherman, who commands the task force of Marines and Guardsmen, told reporters the Marines will not carry live ammunition in their rifles, but they will carry live rounds.

Newsom and the state of California have sued Trump and the Defense Department to stop the deployment, maintaining that none of the Title 10 conditions were met to justify military deployment - such as a when the U.S. is under threat from a foreign invasion or rebellion.

California is also seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the National Guard and Marines from participating in civilian law enforcement.

A hearing on that restraining order is scheduled for Thursday in San Francisco federal court.

The Trump administration argued in a court filing ahead of the hearing that the president has the discretion to determine whether a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion” requires a military response.

PROTESTS SPREAD NATIONWIDE

In downtown L.A., shortly before the second night of a curfew over a one square mile (2.5 square km) area, relative calm was broken.

Police said demonstrators at one location threw commercial grade fireworks and rocks at officers. Another group of nearly 1,000 demonstrators were peacefully marching through downtown when police suddenly opened fired with less lethal munitions in front of City Hall.

Marlene Lopez, 39, a Los Angeles native, was demonstrating as flash bangs exploded just a few meters away.

“I am out here because of the fact that our human rights are being violated every day. If we give up, it’s over. We have to stand our ground here in L.A. so that the nation will follow us,” Lopez said.

Other protests have also taken place in Santa Ana, a largely Mexican-American city about 30 miles (50 km) to the south, as well as major cities such as Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston and Washington and San Antonio, Texas.

New York police said an unknown number of people had been taken into custody on Wednesday. On Tuesday New York police said they took 86 people into custody, of which 34 were arrested and charged, while the others received a criminal court summons.

The protests are set to expand on Saturday, when several activist groups have planned more than 1,800 anti-Trump demonstrations across the country. That day, tanks and other armored vehicles will rumble down the streets of Washington, D.C., in a military parade marking the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and coinciding with Trump’s 79th birthday.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said people who loot or assault law enforcement will be subject to arrest after the Trump administration called in troops to Los Angeles against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) wishes.

“President Trump is going to make America safe again. We’re going to protect Americans, and that includes Californians. If Gavin Newsom isn’t going to protect them, we are,” Bondi told Lawrence Jones III on “Fox & Friends” Wednesday.

“If you loot a business in California during this, we’re charging you with robbery under the Hobbs Act,” Bondi warned. “No longer are the days of non-prosecution for looting. It’s a criminal act. You’ve seen on the news, all these stores being burglarized, vandalized.”

“All of our police officers, all of our federal, state, local law enforcement officers, being abused out there trying to keep California safe. Jointly, we’ve all made over 190 arrests, more coming. If you hit a police officer, if you assault a police officer, state or federal, we are coming after you,” Bondi continued.

Bondi joins the litany of Republicans, including President Donald Trump, painting a picture of a lawless Los Angeles where “riots” are underway and “insurrectionists” are taking over, inviting immediate comparisons to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, that aimed to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The demonstrations in Los Angeles, which are largely peaceful, popped up as a result of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across California.

Trump signed an order authorizing at least 2,000 National Guard troops to be sent to Los Angeles, despite Newsom’s opposition, on Saturday. Then the Pentagon deployed an additional 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines.

Since the start of the protests, the Los Angeles Police Department has arrested 385 people, USA Today reported on Wednesday. Moreover, ICE agents have detained 330 immigrants in Los Angeles so far, White House officials said.

Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday that is set to continue for an unspecified amount of time.

Newsom struck back at the Trump administration on Monday by filing a lawsuit over Trump’s commandeering of the state’s National Guard troops. The following day, he filed a motion seeking an emergency order to stop the Trump administration’s “unlawful militarization of Los Angeles.”

Bass and Newsom have said that the federal government’s actions are escalating tensions and testing how far this administration can take authoritarianism.

“This was provoked by the White House. The reason why? We don’t know,” Bass said at a press conference on Wednesday. “I posit that maybe we are part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor, power from a local jurisdiction.”

She also claimed the Trump administration’s actions show it is deliberately “trying to cause fear and panic.”

In an urgent address on Tuesday evening, Newsom said the issue is bigger than Los Angeles.

“When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commandeer the National Guard, he made that order apply to every state. This is about all of us. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here,” he said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/environmental-racism-indigenous-cara-romero-photographer_n_67e157dee4b003e4b67d857f?origin=top-ad-recirc,"“I’ve been an environmental activist my entire life,” says Native American photographer Cara Romero, who recalls growing up in the ’80s on the Chemehuevi reservation in the Mojave Desert of California. There she watched the strong example set by female relatives such as her grandmother, who at the time, was the chairwoman of their tribe.

“I was raised in a very pristine environment with an intact, undisturbed ecosystem and lots of flora and fauna,” Romero says. “I watched the world around us become very developed, and witnessing that level of encroachment happen within my lifetime made me want to be a protector of what we still have. As Native people, we’re really the guardians of the land and water.”

Though Romero has plenty of advocacy experience under her belt, her primary medium for affecting change is fine art photography — she’s had exhibits, over the past decade, at both the The Met and the Museum of Modern Art. Much of her otherworldly imagery examines the intersection of Indigenous tradition and environmental development in an evocative yet nuanced way that leaves a lasting impression on its viewers.

“These guys are representing time travelers and spiritual beings—as though our ancestors are in the landscape experiencing all of these windmills coming in,” says Romero, who now lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “On paper, this area might look like it’s devoid of so-called ‘cultural resources,’ but from this vantage point, you can see the former tide pools where the tortoise grew. You can see how the flora and fauna are affected, with the development impeding bird and mountain sheep migration.”

It’s called “Evolvers,” she says, because while humans are embracing renewable energy, we still need to acknowledge that big energy development often happens in the backyard of people of color — particularly Native people.

That large-scale image is one of more than 60 photographs currently on display at Dartmouth College’s Hood Museum of Art as part of Romero’s first major solo exhibition, ”Panûpünüwügai (Living Light),” which will be on view at various U.S. cultural institutions through 2027. In it are two particularly compelling sections that touch on the themes of environmental racism and ancestral futures — complementary and simultaneously antidotal ideas. These concepts are presented with Romero’s signature mesmerizing playfulness.

“There are many ways of being an activist in addition to being a frontline fighter, and I believe that art can be a powerful mechanism for social change, because it disarms people,” she says. “People are drawn by its beauty and then as they look closer, they realize they’re seeing some difficult subject matter. I hope my photography allows people to bring their own experience while also considering some of these topics in a way they’ve never done before.”

While it has a documentary-like feel, Romero’s photography is actually very editorial in nature, often the result of extensive planning and even world-building at times. Her outside-the-box approaches — such as shooting underwater — make for ethereal, haunting imagery that tells a story through its mystical realism.

Romero is quite clear that her main audience is her fellow Native Americans. With her art, she aims to be in conversation with them about colonialism-driven issues impacting tribal communities, including land loss, environmental exploitation, resource extraction and the like.

But she does believe this honesty running through her work appeals to non-Native viewers, too. “I’m not trying to pander to a non-Native audience when I’m making art, but I think my work provides an authenticity that they need,” she says. “If telling our truths can improve folks’ understanding, empathy and humanization of Native peoples and our issues, that’s only going to benefit all of us, especially our youth.”

Her current exhibition culminates with a photograph titled “The Zenith,” which depicts an astronaut floating in space alongside corn cobs, set in a technicolor room with dozens of heirloom corn cobs descending from the ceiling. It’s meant, Romero says, to represent the collision of the past and the future, as the plant has played an important cultural and culinary role for many Indigenous communities for millennia.

“These cultural landscapes encompass mythos, spirituality, Indigenous science, and the health of our planet,” she says. “Without understanding how we’re in relationship with the world around us, we’re going to continue in this devastating direction. For centuries, Native peoples have been saying that we can’t treat the earth this way without consequences, and now, she’s trying to take care of herself.”

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ramadan-muslim-fasting-iftar-eating-disorder-health_n_67d87187e4b0dade360d022a?origin=top-ad-recirc,"For the millions of people in the U.S. observing Ramadan this year, the holy month is a time of fasting, prayer, and spiritual reflection. From dawn to sunset, we abstain from food, drink (yes, including water), sex and even negative thoughts as much as possible, all in the name of discipline and gratitude to Allah.

But for Muslims with eating disorders, fasting during Ramadan isn’t just a spiritual challenge — it can be a mental minefield. Instead of strengthening the connection to faith, it can trigger harmful behaviors, amplify anxieties around food, and spark an exhausting tug-of-war between religious devotion and personal well-being.

According to the Quran, those who are sick, menstruating, pregnant or facing undue “hardship” are exempt from fasting and can compensate by fasting later or practicing altruism by feeding someone in need. While this is the known rule, cultural stigmas surrounding mental illnesses such as eating disorders don’t always inspire compassion and understanding from the community.

The result? Muslims with eating disorders are often left to navigate this deeply personal battle alone, with little support and even less awareness. Many Muslims with eating disorders are faced with difficult questions: Should they fast during Ramadan, even if it harms their recovery? Can they honor their faith while also prioritizing their health? And how do they navigate a month so centered around food (or the absence of it) when their relationship with eating is already so fraught?

Mosammat “Mo” Alam, an Atlanta-based Muslim mental health counselor who primarily works with adolescents struggling with eating disorders, tells me that she worries about the consequences of a community that prescribes prayer as the solution to all struggles. “Fasting can be a slippery slope back into a full-blown eating disorder if the person hasn’t reached a point of full acceptance with their body,” Alam says. “In my professional opinion, the best way to support someone struggling with an eating disorder during Ramadan is to support them in not fasting.”

Advertisement

But while the solution may seem simple, the reality is much more complicated. Tanjeela, 25, recalls that her relationship with food was shaped by binge eating disorder long before she even understood it was a problem (Editor’s note: Some sources in this piece preferred to go by their first names only for privacy.) “I didn’t recognize it as a disorder at the time ... people around me saw it as a personal failing or a lack of discipline,” she says. “And I always believed that about myself.”

As Tanjeela grew older, she realized her eating habits were tied to deeper struggles with depression and anxiety. Therapy became a crucial turning point — not just in addressing her eating patterns, but in healing the mental health challenges that fueled them. But each year when Ramadan rolled around, it presented a unique set of difficulties.

“Growing up, the pressure to fast made managing my relationship with food even more difficult,” she says. And this shame around not fasting like her peers led her to hide the truth. “I would lie about fasting, pretending I had made it through the day just to avoid judgment. I’d even go as far as to say I got my period when I really hadn’t.”

My family saw fasting as something you just did, no questions asked. Farah, 22

Suha, 26, also understands the mental gymnastics that come coupled with observing Ramadan as someone with a complicated relationship with food. Her disordered eating patterns fluctuated between extreme restriction, bingeing and long periods of starvation. “While fasting, I would think to myself, ‘Hey, I starve myself anyway, at least this time I am getting good deeds for it,’” she tells me. “Looking back, I realize that validating restrictive eating patterns through something as spiritual as fasting was not healthy.”

Alam emphasizes how important it is for people with disordered eating patterns to challenge their beliefs when it comes to why they restrict their eating. “When such thoughts are arising ... you want to make sure this is your logical voice and not the voice of your eating disorder in the driver’s seat,” she says.

Fasting, in our spirituality, is often seen as a means of practicing self-control. But for Suha, embodying this “strength of will” meant pushing herself past the limits of what fasting required. She found herself skipping iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) and extending her fasts well beyond sunset. “I think a part of me wanted to assert control over at least one thing in my life, which manifested in unhealthy cycles of restriction and bingeing,” she says. It wasn’t until she became more self-aware of these harmful cycles that she sought a path toward balance.

This theme of control is one that’s common in those with disordered eating, Alam explains. “The person struggling with the eating disorder has this notion that because they are able to eat less, restrict food groups, or completely just not eat, they’re in control,” she says. But this often leads to spiraling — which is the exact opposite of feeling in control.

Farah, 22, grew up in a household where fasting during Ramadan was non-negotiable. “My family saw fasting as something you just did, no questions asked,” she says. “It didn’t matter if I was struggling with my mental health or my relationship with food. Not fasting wasn’t an option.”

This expectation prevented Farah from openly discussing her struggles with bulimia — so much so that she didn’t realize until this Ramadan that she even had an eating disorder. “I never told my family or religious leaders about [my struggles]. It didn’t feel safe. The response would have been judgment, not support,” she says.

But a recent health scare shook things into perspective for Farah. While she couldn’t turn to her family, she knew that something definitely had to change — and that began with acknowledging that she had a problem and seeking out help where she might be able to get it. “I have a weak immune system, and a big part of the issue was that I wasn’t nourishing my body with what it needed to support my health,” she tells me.

For many Muslims with eating disorders, the tension between religious obligation and personal well-being can feel isolating. “Balancing my personal health needs with religious and community expectations around fasting has been a journey,” Tanjeela says. “But I’ve grown a lot in the process. I’ve learned to set boundaries and, more importantly, to not feel ashamed for having them.”

But Islam is ultimately rooted in mercy, not punishment, Tanjeela says, adding that “fasting isn’t meant to harm us. If someone is struggling, they deserve compassion, not judgment.” Recovery, for her, means shifting focus to what she believes is the true essence of the month: engaging in prayer, reading and light movement like walks that help her reset her mind. “I remind myself that the discomfort is temporary, but the sense of accomplishment and connection to my faith lasts far beyond the fasting hours,” she says.

Suha, who has learned to approach food with more mindfulness through research, is on a journey to adopt a plant-based lifestyle. While she used to rely on societal norms to dictate her food choices, learning more about where food comes from, how it’s made, and how it affects her body has slowly shifted her thinking into one of creativity and abundance rather than restriction. She finds herself actually excited to try new recipes. “Now, I focus on properly fueling my body. Fasting isn’t about deprivation — it’s about intention and reflection. I’m working on making sure my eating habits reflect that.”

And to her surprise, her family’s been understanding of her journey since she’s opened up about her change in lifestyle. “I was expecting ridicule and confusion, but instead, they’ve been kind and accommodating … definitely not what I anticipated, but I’ll take it,” she says.

Farah’s is more of an uphill battle as she comes to terms with her eating disorder for the first time. She’s leaning on a support system outside of her family. “While I may not be able to change my family’s mindset, I’ve found that surrounding myself with supportive friends who accept and encourage me is crucial,” she says. Having an Islam-informed therapist has also been a game-changer for her. “It creates a safe space where I can navigate my challenges while staying true to my identity.”

One of the biggest lessons Farah is learning in therapy right now is how to speak up for herself — and it’s has been one of the key factors behind her struggle with food. “The experiences I’ve been through made me believe I wasn’t deserving, and without realizing it, restricting my eating became a form of unconscious self-punishment,” she says.

Alam explains, when I talk to her about how eating disorders form, that disordered eating is often a form of self-harm. Low self-esteem, feelings of unworthiness, the need for control and perfectionism can all feed into the emergence of a strenuous relationship with food, she says. These issues can become even further established when cultural norms, religious expectations, and familial pressure clash with healthy boundaries. This is why Alam says that when treating eating disorders, it’s important to pinpoint the underlying issues behind these conditions and work to treat them.

This Ramadan, both Tanjeela and Suha are finding an approach that prioritizes both well-being and religious observance is possible, whether through setting personal boundaries, seeking professional guidance or adapting their participation in a way that supports their health.

As Farah navigates this new terrain, she’s proceeding by giving herself grace. “I remind myself that if I need to break my fast or choose not to fast for any reason, it’s OK,” she says. “I am valid. My worth isn’t determined by my ability to fast — it’s about how I take care of myself in the process.”

Just as it turned 100 in 2016, America’s National Park Service (NPS) began to officially recognize the contributions that LGBTQ+ Americans have made to the rich and diverse history of the United States.

Given the groundbreaking importance of New York City’s Stonewall Inn to global queer history, the National Park Service (NPS) fittingly named New York City’s Stonewall National Monument as its first site dedicated to preserving LGBTQ+ heritage. Since then, several other NPS sites nationwide have been acknowledged both officially and unofficially for their important ties to the queer past.

Stretched across the country and spanning many eras, these places tell inspirational stories of bravery and individualism that deepen our understanding of American history. All free to the public, visits to the following six NPS-managed sites illuminate legacies not just of LGBTQ+ America, but of America itself.

Stonewall National Monument, New York City

On a warm summer night in 1969, long-brewing tensions between New York’s LGBTQ+ community and its police force finally came to a boil. In the face of yet another NYPD raid on Greenwich Village’s Stonewall Inn in the early morning hours of June 28, frustrated bar-goers had finally had enough, and they put up a collective fight. The Stonewall rebellion raged on for days and swelled across the Village, marking the birth of the modern queer movement and making legends out of key participants like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.

“Stonewall was about the fundamental right to live authentically,” says Ann Marie Gothard, co-founder of the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center. “That spirit of resistance and the demand for equality still exist today. Stonewall serves as a reminder that progress isn’t given, it is continually fought for. It also serves as a powerful reminder that we all stand on the shoulders of previous generations.”

Established in 2016, the Stonewall National Monument became the first of its kind dedicated specifically to American LGBTQ+ rights and history. In addition to the Stonewall Inn, the monument encompasses Christopher Park and several surrounding streets where the 1969 riots took place. The interpretive Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center opened last year and includes innovative exhibits like the Mothers of STAR AR Experience, which brings trans and queer icons like Johnson and Rivera back into the Stonewall space.

“Through the Visitor Center, we hope to connect contemporary queer individuals to history while fostering a sense of belonging and community, prompting a call to action for continued progress toward full equality and acceptance for all,” says Gothard.



Good to know: The Stonewall Visitor Center at 51 Christopher Street offers extended June opening hours for Pride month, Monday to Wednesday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Thursday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Regular opening hours are Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Vicksburg National Military Park, Mississippi

Waged for over six weeks in mid-1863, the Siege of Vicksburg in western Mississippi was one of the Civil War’s most grueling and decisive conflicts. More than 110,000 soldiers from across the Union and Confederacy took part in the fighting, including 19-year-old Albert Cashier of the 95th Illinois Infantry.

After the war, Cashier returned to Illinois and settled in the little town of Saunemin about 90 miles southwest of Chicago, where he lived quietly for decades—until his gender assigned at birth was revealed, threatening his military pension.

“Cashier served in Civil War fighting at Vicksburg, the Red River expedition, the Battle of Nashville, and more,” explains Rob Sanders, author of the children’s book The Fighting Infantryman: The Story of Albert D.J. Cashier, Transgender Civil War Soldier. “Every step this transgender soldier took during his three years of service was historic. In old age, when Albert’s right to receive a military pension was questioned, the army finally declared in writing: ‘Identity may be accepted.’ Albert thus became the first transgender soldier in the United States to receive a military pension.”

Today, the 2,500-acre Vicksburg National Military Park preserves the site of the siege, including 1,325 historic monuments and markers, a 16-mile tour road, and a 12.5-mile walking trail. The park’s Illinois State Memorial, located on Union Avenue at milepost 1.8, honors Cashier and his fellow Illinoisan veterans of the siege.

Good to know: The Vicksburg National Military Park Visitor Center at 3201 Clay Street is open Wednesday to Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Vehicle access to the park’s tour road is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., with last entry at 4:40 p.m.

President's Park, Washington, DC

The District of Columbia’s President’s Park is arguably the most cherished of America’s national parks, including as it does the White House, the official residence of the U.S. president. Less known to the general public is that President’s Park also figures prominently in the LGBTQ+ history of DC and the nation.

“The history of President’s Park illustrates the enormous progress gay men and lesbians have made in America, as well as the ways in which LGBT history is intertwined with the broader American story,” says James Kirchick, author of Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington.

“Beginning in the late 19th century, directly across from the building where the most powerful man on earth resides, some of the capital’s most despised citizens—gay men—congregated under cover of night in Lafayette Square,” Kirchick explains. “For decades, the seven-acre grounds were the most popular nocturnal ‘cruising’ site in the city, a place for men leading secret lives to meet one another anonymously.”

Later, President’s Park would serve as the site of one of America’s first protests for gay rights. “On April 17, 1965, under the auspices of the Mattachine Society of Washington, a group of openly gay men and women met outside the White House to hold the first organized picket for gay rights on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Kirchick says.

Good to know: The White House Visitor Center at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue NW is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.

She would go on to inspire generations of feminists, but Rosie the Riveter’s status as a cultural icon began during World War II, when her bandana-clad, muscle-flexing character was created to inspire women to work in factories and shipyards in support of the American war effort.

In 2000, the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park was established as a national park on the site of the former Richmond Shipyards near San Francisco. More ships were built at Richmond than at any other shipyard during World War II, and women made up much of its work force.

Today, the park showcases the rich tapestry of Americans who came together to support the Allied cause. The exhibition “LGBTQ Histories: Stories from the WWII Home Front,” created by independent public historian Donna Graves and now-retired park ranger Elizabeth Tucker, highlights the experiences of LGBTQ+ people in the San Francisco Bay area during the war.

“We believe it is the first LGBTQ+ exhibit at a national park, and it was opened to enthusiasm in 2016,” says Graves. “I continue to be amazed at how it speaks to issues we address today, from housing and health care to climate change.

Good to know: The Rosie the Riveter Visitor Education Center, located within the historic Ford Assembly Plant complex at 1414 Harbour Way South, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Fire Island National Seashore, Ocean Beach, New York

Fire Island has been a popular LGBTQ+ travel destination since the 1930s. It’s also home to the historic Fire Island Lighthouse built in 1858 and it features a keeper’s house, scenic views, and walking/biking paths such as Fire Island Lighthouse Trail, a six-point-five mile out-and-back trail near Bay Shore. Photograph by John Geldermann, Alamy Stock Photo

New Yorkers have been drawn for decades to Fire Island, the beachy 30-mile-long barrier island tucked just beneath Long Island. Twenty-six miles of it are now protected as Fire Island National Seashore, easily accessible by a half-hour ferry ride from the mainland.

“There are very few places like Fire Island, which has been a summer destination for queer people since as early as the 1930s,” explains Jack Parlett, author of Fire Island: A Century in the Life of an American Paradise. “The communities of Cherry Grove and Fire Island Pines—both of which were initially developed with heterosexual families in mind—were transformed by the queer people from the city who discovered them and decided to make a home there.”

These enclaves have been bastions of art, drag, disco, and sexual liberation, Parlett says. “They have also weathered numerous challenges in the last century, from homophobic policing to the devastation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” he adds. “Fire Island is also important to modern queer America, in part, because of its cultural heritage. It is a place where many beloved queer artists and writers have found solace, including James Baldwin, Patricia Highsmith and Frank O'Hara. Also, the parties are great.”

Good to know: From mid-May to mid-October, visitors most commonly access Fire Island by ferry from the Long Island towns of Bay Shore, Sayville, or Patchogue, all reachable by car or the Long Island Railroad.

Frances Perkins National Monument, Newcastle, Maine

Her name might not be widely known, but all working Americans owe Frances Perkins a debt of gratitude. As Franklin Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor and the first woman to ever serve in a presidential cabinet, Perkins was instrumental in developing Social Security and forging federal relationships with labor unions. Perkins was one of only two Roosevelt cabinet members to serve for his entire 1933-1945 presidency, making her the longest-serving U.S. Labor Secretary in history.

Established as a national monument in 2024—one of the newest in the National Park Service system—the Frances Perkins Homestead in Newcastle, Maine had been in the Perkins family since the mid-18th century. It now encompasses the Frances Perkins Center, dedicated to highlighting Perkins’ achievements.

“Perkins was the most effective social progressive in American history, responsible for crafting workplace safety laws that are universal today,” says Kirstin Downey, author of The Woman Behind the New Deal, the definitive Perkins biography, “and as the primary architect of the Social Security program, which has provided an economic bedrock for generations of Americans.”

Downey says Perkins’ complex personal life included a marriage to a man and a series of intense relationships with women who shared her progressive ideals. “She was probably the first [cabinet member] to live openly with a person of the same sex, Mary Harriman Rumsey,” Downey adds. “She was supportive and encouraging of same-sex relationships, which she viewed as marriages.”

Good to know: Accessible only by car, the Frances Perkins National Monument is located at 478 River Road. The Brick House residence remains closed for restorations during 2025, but from June 19 to September 28, the Welcome Center and Homestead Barn will be open Thursday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The grounds are open daily from sunrise to sunset.",World
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/vera-rubin-dark-matter-legacy-astronomy,"Vera Rubin had just finished her ice cream when she saw something that would change astronomy forever. It was long past midnight one early morning in the 1960s, and Rubin and her colleague Kent Ford were at Kitt Peak National Observatory in the middle of the Arizona desert. That night they were tracking how hot gas from young stars circled Andromeda, the Milky Way’s galactic neighbor. Rubin and Ford would trade off recording the gases’ chemical fingerprints or processing photographic plates. While waiting for the plates to develop, Rubin would eat an ice cream cone.

Four cones in, Rubin could draw Andromeda’s rotation curve—she could plot the distance of gas clouds on an X-axis and their speeds on the Y-axis. At the time, astronomers assumed the stars circling a galaxy would act like the planets circling the sun in our solar system. Stars closer to the galaxy’s center would circle quickly, while stars farther out would orbit slowly because core’s gravitational pull was weaker out there. The curve, then, should start high and fall the farther the distance from a galaxy’s center, astronomers assumed.

Rubin never liked assumptions. She’d rather collect data, even if it met expectations. But what Rubin saw in that rotation curve didn’t. The close-in and far-out stars seemed to be circling Andromeda at roughly the same speeds. The curve was flat.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/national-gallery-of-art-smithsonian-exhibit-little-beasts-art-wonder-and-the-natural-world,"The National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian’s Natural History Museum have been next-door neighbors in Washington, DC for nearly 90 years—but until now, they’ve never shared so much as a cup of coffee across the fence.

That all changes this summer, as the two institutions collaborate to create a cross-pollinated art and natural science exhibition featuring selections from the art gallery’s centuries-old paintings of birds, bugs, and exotic critters … along with actual examples of those creatures drawn from the Smithsonian’s enormous collection of animal artifacts.

The exhibit, called “Little Beasts: Art, Wonder, and the Natural World,” focuses on a period beginning in the 1500s when artists in Northern Europe—inspired largely by strange specimens that had found their way to Antwerp, Belgium, aboard merchant sailing ships—were creating exquisitely detailed, and unprecedentedly accurate, images of creatures from the smallest insects to the largest mammals.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/nikkolas-smith-book-the-history-of-we,"You’ve probably heard that we can all trace our roots back to Africa. It’s a fact that most people learn about briefly in a history class or find out through 23andMe. Still, this shared origin story often feels like a blip in our consciousness compared to other time periods. It’s a commonality we’re willing to acknowledge but not always explore.

Picture-book author and film illustrator Nikkolas Smith fills in this curiosity gap with his latest book, The History of We , which he both wrote and illustrated. The self-described “artivist” has dedicated much of his career to rendering crucial moments and people in Black history through expressive paintings, from portraits of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor to a comic-book treatment of the Obamas. One of his most well-known projects is The 1619 Project: Born on the Water, the children’s adaptation of the New York Times venture led by Nikole-Hannah Jones, which he illustrated. With The History of We, Smith continues this tradition of documenting Black history in a way that’s accessible, honest, and completely mesmerizing.",Science

This cultural and design trend is all about understated elegance. You can indulge on the road, too, in these eight hotels that offer everything from perfectly weighted linens to zoned lighting and heated floors.

What is ‘quiet luxury’? Here’s where to experience it, if only for a night.

In recent years, quiet luxury—a trend of pared-back elegance driven by cultural phenomenon and social media influencers—took over fashion. The same ethos has been guiding travelers to certain hotels.

“Quiet luxury is about spaces that feel effortlessly refined, where everything has been carefully considered but nothing screams for attention,” says Pamela Schein Murphy, founder of Wandrist Travel. She notes that details like the texture and weight of linens, perfectly balanced lighting, and technology that enhances rather than intrudes are telltale signs. Structural and practical elements are also important.

“I like the luxury of a great layout and a special view,” says Ashley Isaacs Ganz, founder and chief executive officer of luxury tour operator Artisans of Leisure. “Also, literal quiet—I do not want to hear the crowds on the street or a party downstairs.”

Here are eight hotels where you can experience quiet luxury for yourself.

Aman Nai Lert Bangkok, Bangkok

If there’s one name that embodies quiet luxury, it’s Aman. For 35 years, the brand has developed some of the most rarefied properties in the world. Its newest addition, Aman Nai Lert, is no different. The 52 suites are among the largest in Bangkok, featuring floor-to-ceiling windows to take in the cityscape and neighboring seven-acre Nai Lert Park. The suites’ clean lines and tone-on-tone neutrals set the stage for distinctive Thai design elements. Think decorative banana bark panels behind each bed and bespoke tables made of local supergenti stone. While all guests have access to the ninth-floor outdoor pool, book the Aman suite to soak in your own private spa with hot and cold plunge pools and a sauna.

The Surrey, New York

Manhattan’s Upper East Side is both classic and chic, and The Surrey has been right at home there for almost a century. While its new renovation, guided by Martin Brudnizki of Martin Brudnizki Design Studio, captures the area’s storied sophistication, it also doubles down on modernity, layering rich color palettes and exquisite finishes in the 70 rooms and 30 suites. The craftsmanship is as intricate as it is subtle, like the custom Schumacher trim accenting the silk Phillip Jeffries wall coverings along the rooms’ perimeters. Other discerning details—sculpted crown moldings, Frette linens, fresh flowers—bring an understated opulence that invites you to feel at home.

Villa Miraé, Cap d’Antibes, France

Located in Cap d’Antibes, one of the most sought-after locations on the French Riviera, Villa Miraé envelopes guests in the region’s warmth. Designer Oscar Lucien Ono used soft gradients of golden hues and tranquil blues along with curvaceous Art Deco lines to create a sun-kissed sanctuary that’s both calming and lush. Each of the 35 rooms and eight suites has a harmonious feel, outfitted in Casamance and Pierre Frey textile wall coverings, woven leather headboards, and Maison Paradis ceramics cast in the glow of Murano glass bedside lamps and wall sconces. For an extra dose of serenity, stroll the century-old olive trees and umbrella pines in the Mediterranean gardens outside.

Southern Ocean Lodge, Kangaroo Island, Australia

Snaking along a limestone clifftop on the remote Kangaroo Island, Southern Ocean Lodge feels special even before stepping inside. The 25 suites cascade outward from a central lounge and in each there’s equal emphasis on the wild beauty outside and the curated beauty inside. Everything from the bleached wood furniture to the glass-blown light fixtures to the commissioned artwork is crafted by South Australian artists, creating a cohesive, curated environment. Zoned lighting and EcoSmart fireplaces enhance the ambiance, and private terraces offer the perfect perches for gazing at the surf below.

Mollie, Aspen, Colorado

Mollie makes a good case for luxury that does more with less. Committed to a reduction of excess, design firm Post Company infused the property with a quiet confidence. The 68 rooms, like the entire hotel, reflect the mountain landscape outside, using earthy tones and natural textures like leather and wood. The Aspen Mountain rooms offer particularly stunning views from private terraces, while soft touches like Egyptian cotton sheets and Coyuchi organic robes balance the ruggedness with considered comfort. White oak millwork on the ceilings and black matte porcelain tiles in the bathrooms finish the rooms with just the right amount of design decadence.

While the iconic London hotel Claridge’s exudes an Art Deco glamour throughout, rooms are chicly contemporary. Each of the 11 signature suites has its own character, including the Grand Terrace Suite with a gentling curving interior, original artwork dotting plush Jacquard wall panels, and a private terrace with views across Parliament. There's also the Octagon, a two-bedroom landing pad with a grand piano, gleaming bronze accents, and an eight-sided glass turret. The 248 rooms, smaller in size, are just as plum, what with details like shagreen lamps, generous wardrobes, backlit shelving, and polished marble bathrooms with heated floors.

Regent Bali Canggu, Bali

Not far from Echo Beach, the famed surf spot in Indonesia, the new Regent Bali Canggu brings carefree opulence to the beach. Inspired by traditional Balinese villages, the 141 suites and seven villas are spacious jewel boxes, ranging from 818 square feet to the two-bedroom penthouse that stretches over 6,000 square feet. The rich teak floors create striking contrasts with the crisp white walls and linens, and slatted millwork on the ceilings. But the real showstoppers are the hand-carved teak bathtubs, from which you can sip a cocktail and take in the verdant gardens. Opt for a beachside villa and alternate between dips in a private plunge pool and the Indian Ocean.

SingleThread Inn, Healdsburg, California

Situated above its three-Michelin-starred restaurant, the five-room SingleThread Inn is built on the concept of omotenashi, the Japanese art of hospitality that extols taking care of guests, among the spoils of California wine country. The AvroKO-designed rooms are airy and light with a nonchalant elegance from natural brick, redwood ceilings, and custom art and furnishings like handcrafted vases filled with flowers from the farm. Kitchenettes are stocked with local, cold-pressed juices and bathrooms have heated floors, Toto toilets, soaking tubs, and walk-in rain showers. Wake up each morning to a multi-course breakfast delivered to your room or served on the inn’s rooftop.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/what-is-friday-13th-superstition-facts-science,"There’s no logical reason to fear the occasional coincidence of any day and date governed by the 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. But Friday the 13th can still have noticeable impacts. Sometimes we create them in our own minds—for good and ill.

Why even skeptics can be superstitious

Jane Risen, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, has found that superstitions can influence even nonbelievers. In one 2016 study, Risen found that people who identify as superstitious and non-superstitious both believe a bad outcome is more likely when they've been jinxed. For example, they worry that stating they definitely won’t get into a car accident will make it more likely to happen.

(Learn about Friday the 13th with your kids.)

“Generally speaking, I find that this occurs because the bad outcome springs to mind and is imagined more clearly following the jinx,” she explains. “People use the ease of imagining something as a cue to its likelihood.”

This kind of thinking may be more widespread on Friday the 13th: “Even if I don't actively believe, just that fact that Friday the 13th exists as a known cultural element means that I entertain it as a possibility,” she says. When otherwise unremarkable events occur on that date, we tend to notice.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/real-butterfly-effect-chaos-theory,"In 1961, MIT meteorologist Edward Lorenz was inputting numbers into a weather prediction program. His model was based on a dozen variables, the value of one being .506127. When he ran the model again, he rounded that number to .506, then left the room to grab a coffee. When he came back, he discovered this tiny change had resulted in a dramatically different weather prediction.

When presenting his resultant groundbreaking model of chaos and the potential of extreme chaotic unpredictability at the 1972 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Lorenz posed the question: “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?""

Richard A. Anthes, former president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado (now president emeritus), says Lorenz was illustrating how, “in a system of apparently simple mathematical equations, an infinitesimal change in the initial position of the particle can cause huge changes in its future position—a tiny change now may lead to gigantic and unpredictable change in the future.”",Science

Curious travelers seeking to understand different cultures—near and abroad—can cure their curiosity by visiting historic landmarks and museums. The same can be done when expanding one's knowledge about the LGBTQ+ community and its history—and not just during Pride month in June. These places are open to the public year-round and collect, preserve, and share untold LGBTQ+ stories and contributions to the local and larger mainstream community.

Visiting LGBTQ+ points of interest when you travel can help forge a deeper understanding of a destination and its queer community. ""For too long, LGBTQ+ history was oral and hidden. Dedicated museums preserve truth, challenge misconceptions, and affirm the fundamental right to exist,"" says George Savoulis, director of Qtopia Sydney.

We’ve compiled a list of the seven best places around the globe, including LGBTQ+ museums, that history lovers should consider visiting for Pride Month and beyond.

(These monuments honor LGBTQ history around the world.)

1. The Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, New York City

Located in New York City's SoHo neighborhood, this visual arts museum collects, preserves, and exhibits the work of LGBTQ+ artists including pieces that analyze themes, issues, and people in the community. Founders Charles Leslie and Fritz Lohman created the concept for the museum after hosting an exhibition of gay artists in their SoHo loft.

Today, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art's permanent collection includes Llanor Alleyne’s mixed-media collage “Another Poem (For Colin Robinson)” and Ann P. Meredith’s photo taken during a women’s AIDS foundation support group in 1987. Families visiting with children should be aware that some art on display does feature nudity.

The museum also hosts temporary artist exhibits such as Young Joon Kwak’s “Resisterhood,” a celebration of the human body form and its imperfections during our youth, aging, gestation, or gender transformation. Queer figure drawing classes for and by queer trans bodies and storytelling that celebrate Latinx LGBTQ+ contributions to the arts are just a few examples of fun programs and activities offered to visitors.

(See 100 years of LGBTQ history mapped across New York City.)

2. Queer Britain, London

Located in the King’s Cross district of London, Queer Britain is the first LGBTQ+ museum in the UK. In 2018, Joseph Galliano-Doig and Iain Mehrtens held temporary art installations and exhibitions around the city, eventually becoming this one-of-a-kind museum in 2022.

Queer Britain has four galleries that celebrate queer people but also serve as a place where visitors can immerse themselves in LGBTQ+ stories and ideas. Previous art installations and exhibitions have included a large Pride flag commissioned by Netflix to celebrate the third season of the TV series Heartstopper, a community showcase on queer migrant men, and an exhibit of Jimmy Somerville’s album The Age of Consent (1984).

The newest addition to the museum “20 Years of UK Black Pride,” follows the history of UK Black Pride, from its first gathering in Southend-on-Sea to how it became the largest free Pride celebration for LGBTQ+ Black and people of color. The exhibition runs through August 31, 2025.

3. Qtopia Sydney, Australia

In 2024, Qtopia Sydney opened its doors to the public, becoming the largest LGBTQ+ museum in the world. The museum was the vision of the late Professor David Cooper who hoped to create a space to honor Australians impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Cooper shared this dream with David Polson, one of the first men diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Australia. Making Cooper’s dream a reality, Polson founded Qtopia Sydney.

The history doesn’t stop there, the LGBTQ+ museum is housed inside Sydney’s old Darlington Police Station, where many gay activists were held after the city's first gay protest in 1978. The LGBTQ+ community reclaimed the harrowed building by turning the prison cells into exhibits. ""This building is a profound act of spatial justice—transforming a site of oppression and abuse into one of celebration and education,"" says Savoulis. The first cell of the old police station focuses on police brutality as it relates to the LGBTQ+ community.

When visitors enter the museum, they are confronted with a thought-provoking and revealing exhibition dedicated to the HIV/AIDS epidemic (1981 to late 1990s). Previous temporary exhibits have included an homage to beloved drag queen Joyce Maynge, queer media like Lesbians on the Loose, and “Bedazzled,” a creative display of costumes worn at Mardi Gras (Sydney’s annual Pride celebration).

Located near Fort Lauderdale’s Holiday Park, the Stonewall National Museum, Archives, and Library (SNMAL) has preserved LGBTQ+ history for over five decades. Mark N. Silber founded SNMAL, which claims to have the largest LGBTQ+ collection in the world. The collection started in his parent’s home in 1973, and today, SNMAL frequently rotates its exhibits, but there are permanent, must-see exhibitions on-site, including one that highlights four decades of LGBTQ+ history in Broward County, where the museum is located.

""The exhibits represent the voice of the people, the times, and society at large to represent a full picture of history and culture,"" says Robert Kesten, president and CEO of SNMAL.

SNMAL has hosted previous and upcoming exhibitions and events such as a re-enactment of the Stonewall uprising, ""55 Years of Pride"" and ""Queer Baseball"" exhibitions, a book signing with comedian Bruce Vilanch, and free queer movie nights, including queer favorites such as All About Eve, Moonlight, and Death Becomes Her.

5. Schwules Museum, Berlin, Germany

In 1984, Andreas Sternweiler, Wolfgang Theis, and Manfred Baumgardt were students working as guards at the former Berlin Museum. They encouraged the museum’s director to host an exhibition about Berlin’s LGBTQ+ community. During the summer of 1984, the exhibition— “Eldorado – the History, Everyday Life, and Culture of Homosexual Women and Men 1850-1950,” was on display in the Berlin Museum and welcomed over 40,000 visitors. The success and popularity of “Eldorado” sparked the idea to create a permanent residence for the exhibit, which would eventually be housed in what’s known as Schwules Museum today.

Schwules Museum has been in Berlin’s Tiergarten neighborhood since 2013. Its goal remains to preserve European queer culture by chronicling LGBTQ+ history in Germany and other European nations. Its archive is full of periodicals from the 1990s and over 25,000 books about homosexuality, queer-feminist issues, transgender, and intersex identities. Kit Heyam’s Before We Were Trans: A New History of Gender and Andrea Rottmann’s Queer Lives Across the Wall: Desire and Danger in Divided Berlin, 1945–1970 are a couple of books visitors will find here.

After browsing the library, visit the main exhibition space which displays galleries of photos, videos, postcards, letters, and clothing items from the LGBTQ+ community. The museum has hosted exhibitions on dandyism and Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, an East German gay icon.

(Learn about the great hunt for the world's first LGBTQ+ archive.)

The Gerber/Hart LGBTQ+ Library and Archives in Rogers Park is the largest LGBTQ+ library in the Midwest. Founded in 1981, it houses nearly 15,000 items focused on the LGBTQ+ community and organizations in Chicago and the Midwest of the U.S. Items on display include photo albums from Miss Tillie, a drag performer who started performing in the 1940s and eventually moved to Chicago in the 1960s. Some of the 800 periodicals in its archives include vintage issues of Thing, a Chicago-based magazine in circulation from 1989 to 1993 that covered the local Black LGBTQ+ community.

Visitors can also explore curated galleries that focus on Chicago's drag scene, Pride memorabilia, banned LGBTQ+ books, and areas that focus on topics such as lesbian feminism of the 1970s and 1980s, bisexual activism, and lesbians in sports. Throughout the year, the library has an array of queer events such as a Queer Stitch Night led by fiber artist Isabel Sperry and the Queer Zine Club, an informal gathering of LGBTQ+ people who are curious about queer culture and zine making.

7. GLBT Historical Society, San Francisco

The GLBT Historical Society—in San Francisco’s famed Castro District—is touted as the first stand-alone museum to showcase exhibits focused on LGBTQ+ history and culture in the United States. The museum chronicles queer activism and cultural movements in the Bay Area with a focus on diversity and social justice. The ""Queer Past Becomes Present"" exhibit in the main gallery curated a few personal belongings of Harvey Milk, a gay activist and the first openly gay mayor of San Francisco.

The museum is also home to a large collection of LGBTQ+ historical materials including the Asian/Pacific AIDS Coalition records and Meg Barnett’s collection of Lesbians Against Police Violence records which consist of the organization’s agendas, flyers, notes from general and committee meetings, and a few newspaper and magazine clippings. The archives at the GLBT Historical Society are named after Dr. John P. DeCecco, a psychology professor, author, and pioneer in sexuality studies. Visits to the archives are by appointment only.

Festivals, when cultures reveals themselves most vividly, are some of the best times to visit a new destination — here are the six best summer festivals to travel to this summer.

6 of the best summer festivals to travel to, according to an expert

This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).

There’s no better time to visit a new place than during a festival. These heightened moments, special points in the calendar, are when a culture reveals itself most vividly: town squares are festooned with flowers and draped in finery, people conceal themselves beneath extravagant costumes and wild-eyed masks, and the air is filled with the sound of music and the delicious smells of festival food.

But beyond just being outwardly captivating, festivals are also fascinating portraits of human behaviour. While writing my book about festivals, Fiesta: A Journey Through Festivity, I travelled from Indonesia to Ingol, Lancashire – and found that, across the world, festivals reflect certain universal patterns. The —sual rules of life are upended: social hierarchies dissolve, inhibitions are shed, and altered states of consciousness are pursued with relish. Whether you’re a participant or an observer, the experience of a festival can be inspiring, life-affirming and, sometimes, transcendent. Here are six of the best festivals to visit across the world this summer.

1. Midsommar, Leksand, Sweden

Summer solstice (20/21/22 June)

It may have entered the horror pantheon thanks to the celebrated 2019 movie Midsommar, but there’s nothing (too) scary about Scandinavia’s real-life summer solstice celebrations, the most famous of which is to be found in the central Swedish town of Leksand.

As many as 30,000 spectators descend on the town to watch locals, dressed in traditional white blouses, colourful dresses and floral wreaths, process from the town church to the Sammilsdal, a natural grassy amphitheatre. Here, they dance around a maypole covered in plants and flowers, singing folk songs which celebrate the warmth and light of the year’s longest day. The party continues long into the twilight of the midsummer night, with revellers eating pickled herring and strawberries and drinking aquavit, the potent local liquor.

2. Glastonbury Festival, Pilton, England

Last weekend of June

More than just the archetypal summer music festival, Glastonbury reflects many of the strands common to festivity across the world — seasonality, debauchery, connection to nature, music and dance – and the resulting atmosphere is that of a folkloric utopia, all soundtracked by the finest musicians on the planet. A primordial rooting in the earth and connection to the seasonal calendar — common to many of the Glastonbury area’s festivals — is fostered by the event’s timing close to the summer solstice, and bards, druids and pagans of all stripes can often be found gathered at the festival’s very own stone circle — built not in 3000 BCE, but 1992.

The festival’s proximity to Glastonbury Tor, meanwhile, infuses the event with a touch of King Arthur mythology. And five miles from the festival site, many more solstice celebrants can be found at this green hill topped with a medieval tower, which is often identified with the mythical Isle of Avalon from Arthurian legend. In the nearby town of Glastonbury itself, meanwhile, celebrants gather at the Chalice Well, a sacred spring held in some legends to hide the Holy Grail.

3. Khareef Festival, Dhofar, Oman

21 June-20 September

Every summer, in the Dhofar region of Oman’s less-visited south, the desert blooms. From June to September, the tongues of the southeast monsoon lash the coast around Oman’s second city, Salalah, causing waterfalls and rivers to burst into life and seeing this otherwise arid corner of the Arabian Peninsula erupt in a riot of tropical green. Omanis flock from the oppressive heat of the north to refresh themselves in the fine misty rain, swim in natural pools framed by resplendent greenery, and relish the scent of the world’s finest frankincense trees in full bloom. The carnival-like Khareef Festival sees three months of music and dance performances, souks selling handicrafts and traditional foods, and hot air balloons soaring in the sky above.

4. Festa of Mnarja, Buskett Gardens, Malta

29 June

The tiny Mediterranean nation of Malta has one of the most jam-packed festival calendars in Europe, with more than one hundred festi – the local celebration of Catholic saints’ days — held between March and September. Each has its own character. Rabat hosts a stately affair in March, with regal decorations and a brass-band procession, while Mqabba marks its festa with some of the most rip-roaring fireworks displays imaginable. But the most memorable is arguably Mnarja (or L-Imnarja), held on 29 June to celebrate saints Peter and Paul. Held outside Rabat in the Buskett Gardens woodlands, the event sees locals dressed in medieval ruffs and velvet tunics, displays of fruit and vegetable carving, wandering minstrels playing Maltese folk tunes, and mountains of traditional food, including the national dish, rabbit stew.

5. Abare Festival, Ushitsu, Japan

4-5 July

Travel guides to Japan often emphasise the politeness and gentleness of its people, their cultural aversion to public outbursts and their dedication to exquisite, traditional arts and crafts. All of which makes it somewhat surprising to turn up in the Noto Peninsula town of Ushitsu each July and find it consumed by the chaos and fury of the Abare Festival, a.k.a the ‘Fire & Violence Festival’. Huge, beautiful lanterns, painted with mythological scenes and folktales, are painstakingly created throughout the year, only to be ritualistically destroyed by a band of drunk, loincloth-clad men, who smash the decorations against lampposts and pavements before burning them at the town’s main shrine. This symbolic riot of rage has its origins in the 17th century, as a way to ward off disease. Before, during and after the main procession, much sake is consumed by participants and spectators alike.

6. Phuket Vegetarian Festival, Phuket Old Town, Thailand

Ninth lunar month (September or October; dates vary)

A vegetarian festival, you might think, sounds pretty wholesome; a celebration of the tasty, health-bestowing properties of a meat-free diet. The island of Phuket, however, clearly didn’t get the memo. While this celebration does incorporate much delicious plant-based food, the nine-day Phuket Vegetarian Festival is more explicitly characterised by deafening noise and mind-boggling ritual mutilation, with spirit mediums processing through the streets of Phuket Old Town by the thousand with swords, skewers and other sharp objects stuck through their faces at all angles. Firewalking and climbing ladders of knives are among the other trials which the spirit mediums undertake, all while in a deep trance, to the sound of a chorus of firecrackers. Not an event for the faint of heart.

Turning to nature for connection

In a world grappling with disconnection and digital overload, there has been a steady rise in spiritual tourism and pilgrimages. People are turning to sacred places not just to see the history, but to experience something bigger than themselves.

“Humans believe that the sacred is an energy that inhabits particular places or buildings,” says Jeffrey Kripal, the J. Newton Rayzor Chair in Philosophy and Religious Thought at Rice University and author of How to Think Impossibly, among a dozen other books. “It’s innate in human nature to return to these sacred places. We somehow need this as human beings.”

“Mountains, large bodies of water, and canyons frequently inspire this reverence,” says Susannah Crockford, an anthropologist specializing in religion, ecology, and political economy. She adds that such geographical features often stir deep emotional responses in the human brain. “They are very vast, very affecting.”

It’s not just natural features that move us. Human-built structures, like Indonesia’s Borobudur Temple or Turkey’s Göbekli Tepe, imbue a landscape with meaning in such a way that it creates this sense of awe, says Sabina Magliocco, a professor of anthropology and religion at the University of British Columbia. “Cathedrals, temples, and mosques are constructed to create this sense of connection to something greater than oneself,” says Magliocco.

Across cultures and centuries, we design places to hold our sense of mysticism.

The importance of storytelling

Once a place is considered sacred, that feeling tends to linger, even if the use or message shifts. That’s why we are drawn to ancient sites and why sacred places are often built upon one another, both literally and symbolically.

While many of these places are extraordinary on their own, it is often the stories we tell and the rituals we repeat that make them sacred. “People make places sacred,” Magliocco says. “We create place through space personally.” We do this in our everyday lives, for example, by becoming regulars at coffee shops. It’s our way of saying ‘I belong here.’

Cultures also create this sacred meaning on the larger landscape through collective storytelling. These narratives link physical locations to divine beings, heroic events, or spiritual transformations. A place becomes sacred through repetition when stories are retold and rituals reenacted. The acts themselves imprint meaning. Over time, that meaning deepens. Eventually, people build structures to house these rituals, laying foundations for sacred spaces for future generations to connect with.

The lens of our viewpoint matters

Why we’re drawn to these mystical places often depends on whom you ask, says Crockford. Religious people might say the experience is due to God or a divine presence there. A psychologist might say the feeling is simply your brain’s response to awe. An anthropologist will tell you it’s society projecting itself onto its gods.

“There isn’t one answer as to why these spaces are sacred. When someone tells you an answer, the answer tells you more about the person you’ve asked, rather than the space itself,” Crockford says.

Pilgrimages can foster a deep sense of meaning and connection to a place, like the Chandragup mud volcano or the Camino de Santiago. Photograph by Matthieu Paley, Nat Geo Image Collection (Top) (Left) and Photograph by Matthieu Paley, Nat Geo Image Collection (Bottom) (Right)

In that sense, sacredness is like a mirror, which helps explain why so many different people are intrigued by these spaces. People project meaning onto a site and then see their beliefs reflected back. A yogi feels energetic alignment on a quiet mountainside. A traveler walking the Camino de Santiago may feel something sacred not from the churches, but from the journey itself.

Kripal agrees. It’s not just the place—it’s the interaction that creates the experience. “I suspect it’s a relationship between the person and the place,” he says

That relationship can be self-reinforcing. The more people who report spiritual experiences at a location, the more others come seeking that same connection. That expectation, Crockford says, makes it more likely they will experience something spiritual.

Spiritual and mystical experiences are deeply personal

That doesn’t make it any less real. “These experiences are personal and individualized. You can’t run a replicable experiment to prove someone’s mystical experience,” Crockford says. “But that doesn’t invalidate it.”

Science, by its nature, destabilizes sacred stories. It offers a grand, cohesive narrative—like the Big Bang or evolution—that leaves less perceived room for myth.

This tension has the potential to undermine the meaning of sacred places. And yet, countless people continue to experience profound, unexplainable moments at these sites. That sense of being connected to something larger than us, something enduring, is appealing and can feel rare in modern life. Sacred places meet this very human need, offering a moment outside of time and a space where the constant search for proof dissolves.

The good news, Magliocco says, is that sacredness isn’t limited to Machu Picchu or Stonehenge. “We can make a meaningful place out of anywhere,” she says.

“The real mecca,” Kripal adds, “just might be in the heart.”",Science

Just a boat ride from Sicily, the island of Salina offers an authentic, laid-back Italian getaway with volcanic cliffs, lush landscapes, and extraordinary views.

Love Sicily but not the crowds? Visit this Aeolian island instead

Hop on a hydrofoil from Milazzo, Sicily, and in less than two hours you’ll find yourself on the beautiful island of Salina. Stromboli's volcano stands tall on the distant horizon, and unlike Sicily, there are not many crowds of people. Locals whizz by on mopeds while only a few tourists relax at a sea cove on the side of the road.

Salina is the second-largest island in the Aeolian archipelago (Lipari is the largest), yet it is home to only around 2,500 residents, making the island the perfect immersion into relaxed Italian island culture and lifestyle.

A small island with a big personality

“Salina is like stepping into a love story—it’s not about flashy attractions but about the quiet beauty that slowly captures your heart. It’s the greenest of the Aeolian Islands, with lush landscapes, volcanic peaks, and the most incredible sea views,"" says Anita Motta, owner and hotel director of Principe di Salina, a boutique hotel on the island.

Though much smaller than Sicily, Salina does not lack in personality. Upon arriving at Santa Marina's port, one of the island’s three cities, travelers will discover Santa Marina’s narrow streets are populated with cafes, restaurants, bars, and clothing boutiques that have sourced items from across Italy. The town’s mainstay is its 18th-century yellow-and-white-trimmed church with bell towers.

""What makes it truly special is its authenticity. You won’t find crowds or over-commercialized spots here. Instead, you’ll discover artisan wineries, caper farms, and locals who welcome you like family,"" says Motta. ""It’s a place to immerse yourself in nature, indulge in slow living, and feel the rhythm of the Mediterranean.""

What to do in Salina

This charming island can be easily divided into small regions. Begin the adventure in Malfa, a lovely town with boutiques, restaurants, and vineyards. Savor the local cuisine at In Sé Natura, perched on a cliff with direct views of the sea, or at the Michelin-starred Signum.

Salina is best known for its fine grapes and Malvasia wine, which can be dry or sweet. Stroll downhill and you’ll encounter Punta Scario Beach, a cove that is home to a rocky beach where sunbathers can rent inflatable mattresses from a local sitting in a chair at the bottom of the steps.

(This volcanic Italian island was made for wine)

Pollara is one of the most stunning areas to the northwest of the island; it was created by a partially collapsed volcanic crater that formed a bay on the island. The location is known for being the primary set of the 1994 movie Il Postino.

Capers are one of the island’s largest exports, and visitors can spend hours at the Sapori Eoliani caper farm in Pollara learning about the salty fruit.

There is a small World War I fort on the road between Malfa and Pollara, popular for its panoramic views and breathtaking sunsets. “Watching the colors of the sky shift over the ancient volcanic cliffs is an experience that stays with you forever,” says Motta.

The southwestern village of Rinella has two different noteworthy attractions. First is the Spiaggia di Rinella black sand beach, which is ideal for spending a relaxing afternoon soaking up the sun. Second is Pa.Pe.Rò restaurant, known for its ricotta granita. Granita is a Sicilian dessert that is essentially a shaved ice dessert with flavoring.

Lingua is at the southernmost end of the island, and has a scenic short promenade walk that ends at the lighthouse. You'll find shops, cafes, and the not-to-be-missed Da Alfredo restaurant. Da Alfredo is a family-run restaurant overlooking the esplanade, known for its pane cunzato, a traditional Sicilian open-faced sandwich. The town is at sea level, and you’ll see locals and tourists lounging in the water while waiting for their food to be served.

Where to stay

Principe di Salina is a boutique hotel set on the cliff of the island with views of the sea and Stromboli volcano. The hotel is run by a wife-and-husband duo: Anita runs the hotel, and Filippo is the baker. Upon entering the open-air lobby, guests will find towels and towel baskets at the front desk, a tell-tale sign of relaxed island life.

Rent an e-scooter or book a boat tour around the island. Guests can indulge in a daily poolside happy hour, bask in the sun around the hotel’s centerpiece, the aquamarine-colored pool, or lounge in one of the hotel’s many hammocks, mattresses, or couches for an afternoon siesta.

Breakfasts and dinners are served communal style, on a long table where guests can mingle. If there is leftover food, Anita will personally serve a second (and even third) helping to guests craving more.

“The story of Principe di Salina is deeply rooted in my family’s history and love for this island. It all began when my grandfather Alfredo first came to Salina with my mother, Silvana, who was just a little girl at the time. Their connection to the island was instant and profound,"" says Motta. ""Fast forward to 2017, my parents and I decided to honor that legacy by opening Principe di Salina.""

Hotel I Cinque Balconi is another island favorite. It’s a great stop for the first or last night on the island since Santa Marina is where the hydrofoil docks. It's been family-owned by the Lo Schiavos since the 18th century. The great-grandfather of the current owners was a sea merchant and collaborated with the owner of the adjacent building, also a sea merchant. The hotel is known for having five balconies that overlook the sea, hence the hotel’s name, which means ""five balconies.""

The building presents hints of historical architecture and has an impressive garden of fig and pomegranate trees, roses, and mint, among a number of other beautiful and fragrant plants. The hotel’s Casa Lo Schiavo restaurant is well-regarded by locals and tourists for its open kitchen and flavorful traditional dishes.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/unloved-animals-conservation-population-underdogs,"What does it take to be a Very Important Animal? It helps if you’re cute, furry, jumbo size, and/or adorned with attention-grabbing outerwear—think the interesting patterns of leopards and zebras.

Cuteness is an especially powerful draw, thanks to our brain’s programming. “What we find is cute in animals is often the same things we find cute in human babies, such as big, forward-facing eyes,” says Gabby Salazar, an environmental social scientist and National Geographic Explorer. We’re genetically designed to love and nurture babies, and babyish animals such as the panda (which appears on the WWF logo) reap the benefits.

Being on the A-list comes with yet another benefit, what psychologists call the halo effect. This means that we mistakenly imbue attractive people and animals with additional positive characteristics, such as moral goodness. It’s why so many movie heroes are equipped with gleaming teeth and chiseled jaws and so many villains have scars.

But in reality, both with humans and animals, prettiness doesn’t equal benevolence or courage, and neither does ugliness equal nastiness or cowardice. Just look at the toucan. “I love toucans, but they don’t just use that beak to eat fruit,” says Salazar. “They also use that beak to scoop up baby birds from other birds’ nests.” Not something you’d see Toucan Sam from Froot Loops doing.

So how do we fix this PR problem? How do we get the animal kingdom’s outcasts more attention and the conservation dollars they deserve? Salazar says one key is to tell better stories. For starters, we can highlight the benefits some of these animals provide, such as the vultures’ role in garbage disposal.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fulani-africa-nomadic-people,"On the most basic level, “Fulani” has become an umbrella term that encompasses many different groups of people, explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, a Fulani Mbororo woman and a knowledge holder among her community. She compares those groups to branches on the Fulani tree. “In West Africa, you have Futa Toro [and] Fouta Djallon,” says Ibrahim, who is a National Geographic Explorer and president of the Peul Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad. “And then in our area of Central Africa we have some Mbororo”—which is her own branch of peoples. Within the branches there are many different communities. But the majority still feel a strong connection to the land, she says, and their ancestral way of life.

At the same time, those who carry on the traditional practice encounter new threats from climate change and regional disputes along their pathways, including occasional aggression from landowners. Some of the more recent conflict may be fueled by an unfounded assertion among some governments and non-Fulani communities that the Fulani are disproportionately joining jihadist groups. The reality is that herders heavily contribute to the region’s economy and have a long history of peaceful trade with farmers and business owners.",World
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/awa-sow-fulani-women-africa,"In northern Senegal, on the vast Ferlo reserve, a different model of political participation has taken shape for the Fulani—and a galvanizing community leader is offering herders a fresh way to think about how problems might be solved. Her name is Awa Sow, an organizer whose decades of work have earned her respect and also rare authority.

“Awa is a woman warrior with unique authority in this region,” says Aliou Samba Ba, the leader of an influential herders association on the reserve. “Anyone who wants to organize a successful activity in her area—whether political, development, cultural, or religious—has to pass by her.” And Sow foresees a very different future for the Fulani on the Ferlo reserve.

Here, Fulani herders have political representation. As a result, in recent years the government has invested in rural development and boosting livestock production and trade. This has helped these Fulani avoid the conflict experienced in other areas. But rainfall levels are dropping, killing off native grasses and putting more pressure on water resources. Now, instead of whole families joining the seasonal migration, it is mostly the men who depart on donkey carts loaded with goods and supplies for ever longer trips, leaving women and children behind in arid villages. Sow’s efforts, undertaken through the litany of programs and initiatives she leads, aim to engage those women—and perhaps create the kind of political system that could be a useful model for communities far beyond Ferlo.

Usmaan Soh, 27, lives in Senegal with his wives (from left), Naana and Kura, and their children, Hadraan Usman and Haawa Kura.

Sow, 63, lives in Barkedji, a rural community of roughly 25,000 people located in the northern part of the reserve. She holds no official governmental role, in part because her influence has grown far beyond that. The problems facing seminomadic Fulani across the region are complex, so her solutions attack them from different directions.

One way has been rethinking how Fulani women can participate in politics to help them exert more control over their precious resources. When men leave the Ferlo reserve, for instance, it often diminishes the power of women. As warming temperatures have forced herders to go farther south to keep their livestock watered and fed, men are now gone even longer, coming back to the villages only a few months each year.",World

Retinoic acid, a substance also abundant in the human body—as well as in many skin creams—has long been known to be a major player.

What keeps you working?

Because people I like working with keep asking me to. I enjoy the process of filmmaking. But stepping back, I can also see that this sort of storytelling has never been more important. Many of our societies have never been more removed from nature, less in tune with its rhythms and changes. That has brought many benefits, of course, but it does also mean that we don’t necessarily notice the changes to our world as acutely as we once would have done.

Whilst scientific publications and debates are vital, most of us are far more likely to engage with a story or a documentary. Our species has always used storytelling to create a shared identity and give explanation and context to the world around us. We are naturally interested in the stories of other people and places, so the onus is on all of us, as well as broadcasters and publishers, to find the ways to tell stories of the natural world and our relationship with it.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/treasure-hunters-influencers-river-thames-uk,"But the competition to find such relics has rapidly increased. Peel is a particular kind of amateur treasure hunter known as a mudlark. The term, originally used to describe poor Londoners who searched the river for scraps to sell in the 18th and 19th centuries, has found new meaning today among a growing number of hobbyists who hunt for artifacts along riverbanks around the world. One of the most iconic spots remains the Thames, which has seen thousands of years of habitation along its waterfront. With some 95 miles of riverbank subject to tides, its foreshore is the longest archaeological site in London.

Not only do centuries-old objects survive, but they sometimes emerge looking just like they did when they went into the mud. The river’s silt blocks out oxygen, meaning metals don’t rust and bacteria can’t decompose organic material. Twice a day, tidal shifts expose new trash and potential treasure from throughout the ages.

For decades mudlarks have been granted permission to hunt along the Thames by the Port of London Authority (PLA), which issued permits for up to three years at a time to a small community of hobbyists. But during the pandemic that community grew dramatically, causing the PLA to upend their application process. They recently announced they are capping the total number of permits, each only valid for one year. To accommodate the surge in interest, the agency created a waiting list, which quickly increased to more than 10,000 people and was closed. Active permit holders could not join the list until their current permit was close to expiring, and many veteran mudlarks missed the window. They fear it might take years to get another permit.

These remarkable finds are featured in the London Museum Docklands’ exhibit on mudlarking in the River Thames (clockwise from top left): ball and chain from the late 1600s; Roman marble head, probably of a goddess; 18th-century dentures made from human teeth; and glasses from around 1600. PHOTOGRAPHS BY SIMON ROBERTS

The decision was crushing for Peel, who since 2020 has unearthed more than 50 items included on the Portable Antiquities Scheme’s database of archaeological finds discovered by the public, managed by the British Museum. “When the news was announced, it felt like a life-changing loss,” Peel said. “It felt like I was in mourning.”

While many longtime mudlarks are devastated to lose a beloved hobby, the new rules could have broader consequences. Time is crucial when recovering artifacts from the Thames. Once the river frees something from the silt’s protective properties, the object is vulnerable to damage from the current and can begin to rust or decay. It often takes an experienced eye to find important relics before they are destroyed for good. “There aren’t enough resources for professional archaeologists to monitor all of the foreshore,” said Kate Sumnall, a curator of archaeology at London Museum. “Mudlarks fill a bit of that gap. They are highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals, and they’re there every single tide.”",Science

One night last December, National Geographic Explorer Kim Bernard was stirring her Earl Grey tea in the galley of a research ship off the coast of Antarctica, preparing for a long night of observing a remotely operated vehicle as it surveyed the seafloor. When the marine ecologist looked up to a monitor showing a live video feed sent by the ROV from a depth of more than 3,000 feet in the Southern Ocean’s murky waters, something caught her attention. “I see this tiny little thing come in on the right-hand side of the screen and dart out,” she said.

To the other scientists aboard, it probably looked like organic debris wafting down. But Bernard, 46, has been studying krill for 15 years and knows how the shrimplike crustaceans twirl in the water column and bolt backward when startled. That familiar movement sent her running down two flights of stairs to the ship’s control room.

Collected specimens from the seafloor.

When she arrived, she saw the action on the seafloor being broadcast on a large bank of monitors, and she spotted a handful of individual krill spread out on a hydrothermal vent, a fissure in the ocean crust where hot magma and seawater meet and create a mineral-rich environment that attracts a host of organisms. For Bernard, a professor of biological oceanography at Oregon State University, finding krill here represented a momentous discovery. “I kind of lost my mind,” she recalled. It was the first time the animal had been observed on a vent.",Science
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/article/anya-brown-explorer-story,"“So the clue was, ‘This temperate coral undergoes quiescence in the winter. Another word for this is … ?’” Anya Brown has spent most of her adult life around coral reef systems. Her brother, meanwhile, has cultivated a career as a writer on the American quiz show, “Jeopardy!”

He once consulted her for a marine science question idea, which aired on season 39 (episode 8924) of the series. “The word was ‘hibernation,’” Brown reveals, and it had formed the basis of her post-doctoral research assessing how corals go dormant, and what happens to their microbial communities when they do. She’s devoted her career to investigating how microbes influence ecology and the evolution of macroscopic species.

“So, I go from the teeny tiny, to the large,” says Brown, a marine biologist, ecologist, National Geographic Explorer and assistant professor at the University of California, Davis.

Since 2022, Brown has been a lead scientist on the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Ocean Expedition in Rarotonga, the most populous of the Cook Islands. In close collaboration with the Rarotonga nonprofit organization Kōrero O Te 'Ōrau , local partners Teina Rongo, Jackie Rongo and Siana Whatarau, and fellow UC Davis professor Dr. Rachael Bay, Brown has planted and monitored a coral nursery to better understand the nuances of coral bleaching — the loss of the coral’s nutrient supply via two important types of microbes: symbiotic bacteria and algae (also called zooxanthellae), which live in coral tissues. The team is examining the role of microbes and coral genetics in heat tolerance and bleaching resistance .

“It turns out some coral species are far more resistant to bleaching, meaning they don’t respond to the heat stress, than others,” explains Brown.

The team’s findings could hold promising implications for the recovery of dwindling marine life as rising ocean temperatures have caused more frequent, longer-lasting bleaching events in recent years.

Moreover, “It’s possible that some species that don’t bleach under heat stress, are rescuing coral types that do.” This would be consistent with Brown’s research in Little Cayman, Cayman Islands, which found that nursery corals organized with different genotypes decreased disease.

But to say with more certainty whether this is the case in Rarotonga, the team needs to start by examining coral DNA.",Science

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/article/shabana-basij-rasikh-explorer-story,"Some time after the Taliban’s first fall, when National Geographic Explorer Shabana Basij-Rasikh was eleven years old, she was taking a school placement test in Kabul. According to official records, Basij-Rasikh, like every girl in Afghanistan at the time, had not attended school for the last five years–unless it was done in secret.

It was 2001, and Basij-Rasikh looked around at her classmates. The girls were five to six years her senior, and most would have to make up for lost time, since Taliban-installed authorities had declared girls’ education illegal.

“It was in that moment I fully realized what my parents had done for me, what they risked for me,” she recalls, referring to the tough decision every daughters’ family faced at the time: obey the order that robbed their children of an education, or risk their lives for it. Her parents chose the latter.

Basij-Rasikh took her education underground. She disguised herself as a young boy, chaperoned by her older sister, and the pair commuted to secret schools. They carried their books in unsuspecting shopping bags, and varied their walking routes to avoid even the appearance of a pattern that could draw suspicion. In the eyes of the Taliban these schools are illegal. They often operate out of basements, living rooms and bedrooms, with educators and students willing to risk it all.

In war, everything could be taken away in an instant. Basij-Rasikh’s father, the first to be educated in the family, often reminded his daughters of this fact.

“And then, he’d point to his head and say, ‘the one thing that can’t ever be taken away is here. It’s the most important investment in your life,’” Basij-Rasikh remembers. She never gave up on her education, and turned to investing in the new generation of girls on their quest to learn.

“I’ve said it many times, but it’s worth repeating: the secret to a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan is no secret at all. It’s educated girls.”

In 2008, Basij-Rasikh co-founded the School of Leadership, Afghanistan (SOLA), a safe place for girls to attend a school in hopes of shielding them from the threats that loomed over her own future.

“SOLA is the only legally-operating boarding school for Afghan girls that exists anywhere on Earth — and I say this with pride, I say this with sadness, and I say this with anger.”

Her remarkable story eventually led her to earn a master’s from Oxford, and honorary doctorates from multiple universities. But, Basij-Rasikh says, her story alone should not be special.

“The ideal future is one in which educating Afghan girls isn’t seen as exceptional or extraordinary,” she stresses. “The future I want is one in which Afghan girls go to school, receive an education, and it’s utterly and entirely normal. That’s what I’m working on.”

Basij-Rasikh, who was recognized as the 2023 Rolex National Geographic Explorer of the Year, is one of the six percent of Afghan women to have a college diploma. She spent a year of high school in the United States on an exchange program, then studied at Vermont’s Middlebury college where she started SOLA while earning her degree in International Studies and Women & Gender Studies. She later completed her master’s in public policy at Oxford, and eventually returned to Afghanistan.

SOLA, which translates to “peace” in the Pashtun language, is Afghanistan’s only all-girls boarding school. Since the Taliban’s second seizure of the country in 2021, school for Afghan girls beyond the sixth grade is forbidden. When girls' education was banned again, Basij-Rasikh destroyed any trace of SOLA’s records and evacuated Afghanistan to plant the school in Rwanda. She took every student, along with many staff and their family members, with her.",World

https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/myth-busted-friday-13th,"Maybe you refuse to open an umbrella inside your house or walk under a ladder that’s on a sidewalk. These are superstitions, or a belief that something bad will happen even if there’s no reason to think that it will.

One big superstition in the United States is that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.

Happening up to three times a year depending on the calendar, the day seems to make people more careful or avoid things they usually aren’t afraid to do. In fact, experts think so many people skip work on Friday the 13th that businesses can lose hundreds of millions of dollars!

Of course, no one can prove that more misfortune takes place on Friday the 13th. We just tend to notice it more if bad things happen on that day. But if Friday the 13th is only a superstition, why do people actually believe in it? No one knows for sure, but experts have some clues.

Origin story

It’s hard to know exactly when Friday the 13th became thought of as unlucky, but it likely comes from the Christian religion. For example, in the Bible, Judas—a person who is said to have betrayed Jesus—was the 13th guest at the Last Supper. Also in the Bible, many unfortunate things happened on Fridays. So it made sense that people who read the Bible got nervous around Friday the 13th.

It’s also possible that 13 is considered “cursed” because it’s the number after 12, which many people see as a number that completes things. Think about it—12 months are in a year, 12 inches in a foot, 12 pairs of ribs in a body, etc. So it’s possible the number 13 makes people uneasy because it causes them to think about the unknown—beyond the number 12.

Around the world

In other countries, Friday the 13th isn’t unlucky. For instance, in Spain, Tuesday the 13th is considered the day to dread. And in Italy, people fear the 17th day of the any month. Why? Because the Roman numeral XVII (17) can be rearranged to spell “VIXI,” which means “my life is over” in Latin. But, like in the United States, no one can prove that more terrible things occur on those days, either.

Back to reality

People who are super afraid on Friday the 13th might have condition called triskaidekaphobia (pronounced trihs-keye-dek-uh-FOE-bee-uh), which is a fear of the number 13. (Any extreme or irrational fear of something is called a phobia). The word comes from ancient Greek and translates to “fear of the number 13.”

For most people, being afraid of Friday the 13th is just a superstition, something that we can have fun pretending to fear because we know, well, there’s really nothing to fear. But if you want to cross your fingers just in case, that’s fine too!

https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/homework-help/article/how-to-write-an-animal-report,"Key Information

Here are some things you should consider including in your report:

What does your animal look like?

To what other species is it related?

How does it move?

Where does it live?

What does it eat?

What are its predators?

How long does it live?

Is it endangered?

Why do you find it interesting?

SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION:

Your animal may have been featured in a movie or in myths and legends. Compare and contrast how the animal has been portrayed with how it behaves in reality. For example, penguins can’t dance the way they do in Happy Feet.

PROOFREAD AND REVISE:

As with any essay, when you’re finished, check for misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and punctuation errors. It often helps to have someone else proofread your work, too, as he or she may catch things you have missed. Also, look for ways to make your sentences and paragraphs even better. Add more descriptive language, choosing just the right verbs, adverbs, and adjectives to make your writing come alive.

BE CREATIVE:

Use visual aids to make your report come to life. Include an animal photo file with interesting images found in magazines or printed from websites. Or draw your own! You can also build a miniature animal habitat diorama. Use creativity to help communicate your passion for the subject.

Also called the Fourth of July, Independence Day marks the historic date in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress. The written declaration stated that the American colonies were tired of being ruled by Great Britain. They wanted to become their own country.

A GROWING ANGER

Before the declaration, America was part of the Kingdom of Great Britain (now called the United Kingdom). In the 1600s, people came from Great Britain to settle in what is now North America. Between 1607 and 1732, the British founded 13 colonies: Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

As these colonies grew, the people who lived there thought the British government treated them unfairly. For instance, they had to pay taxes on items such as tea and allow British soldiers to stay in their homes. The colonists had to follow these laws but couldn’t do anything to change them. The colonists rebelled. As a result, the Revolutionary War between the colonists and Great Britain began in 1775.

Fighting wasn’t enough though. The colonists decided they needed to declare their independence in writing to explain their reasons and gain support from other countries like France. On July 4, 1776, a small group of representatives from the colonies—called the Continental Congress—adopted the Declaration of Independence.

DECLARING INDEPENDENCE

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Written by a committee led by Thomas Jefferson, the document was signed by people from all 13 colonies. But the British government didn’t accept it. So the colonists continued to fight for independence until they finally defeated Great Britain in 1783.

The Declaration of Independence, now housed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., is recognized around the world as an important message of self-governance and human rights. The second sentence says it all: that all people are created equally and have rights that include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. (Fun fact: Jefferson, who would become the third U.S. president, wrote that sentence!)

Today the United States and Great Britain are friends. Most Americans still celebrate Independence Day, often with parades and fireworks. Historians think this is thanks to a letter written by John Adams, who helped write the declaration and would also go on to be the second U.S. president. In his letter to his wife, Abigail, Adams predicted that the colonists’ independence would be celebrated by future generations as an annual festival with parades and bonfires.

https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/womens-suffrage-movement,"The mist starts to fade as President Grover Cleveland takes the stage on Liberty Island, New York. It’s October 28, 1886, and he’s dedicating the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France representing freedom and democracy. But suddenly, women’s rights leader Lillie Devereux Blake and 200 other women sail by on a boat. They're holding a sign that reads, “American women have no liberty.”

At that time, women in the United States didn’t have many rights, and it had been that way ever since the first settlers arrived. Women weren’t encouraged to go to college (few colleges for women existed anyway) and instead were expected to marry and care for their children, husbands, and households. Once they did marry, they were entirely dependent on their husbands. Women couldn’t own property, and they had to give any money they made over to their husbands. They also weren’t allowed to vote.

By the mid-1800s, women started to fight back, demanding suffrage, or the right to vote. These women were called suffragists.

The movement begins

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

In 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the first convention regarding women’s rights in the United States. Called the Seneca Falls Convention, the event in Seneca Falls, New York, drew over 300 people, mostly women. They wanted to be treated as individuals, not dependents of men. They wanted more employment and education opportunities. They wanted the option to run for office, speak in front of Congress, and vote.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

On the second day, the attendees signed the Declaration of Sentiments and Grievances. Stanton modeled the document after the Declaration of Independence, which mentions only men. She wrote that men and women should be created equal and have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A hundred people signed the declaration, which included 12 resolutions that supported women’s rights. These resolutions, including the right to vote, would be the guiding principles for the women’s suffrage movement.

The Seneca Falls Convention was attended mostly by white women, even though northern states like New York had outlawed enslavement. But in 1851, Black women, such as Sojourner Truth, a former enslaved person who became a women’s and civil rights advocate, attended the Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

When white men tried to take over the meeting, Truth got angry. She stood up and made up a speech on the spot. Called “Ain’t I A Woman,” her speech argued that because she did the same things as men when she was enslaved, she should also have the same rights as men. It was one of the first speeches to address both gender and racial discrimination and is remembered as one of the greatest speeches of the women’s rights era.

Small steps

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Many suffragists were also abolitionists, people who wanted to end slavery. President Abraham Lincoln freed enslaved people with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, and in 1869 the 15th Amendment gave Black men the right to vote. Although happy that slavery had been abolished and that African American men could vote, some suffragists were angry that women were not included in the amendment.

In response, Stanton and fellow suffragist Susan B. Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association. The next year, the group of about 90 women sent a letter to the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives urging that women be included in the amendment and that they be able to speak in front of Congress to argue their points. Congress refused.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry Brown Blackwell, had a different idea about how to gain suffrage for women. They founded the American Woman Suffrage Association to support the 15th Amendment for Black men’s vote, figuring that the amendment wouldn’t pass if women were included. Instead of going to the federal government like Anthony and Stanton did, the group traveled the country asking each state government to change its constitution. The hope was that if enough states allowed women to vote in local elections, the federal government would have to make changes as well.

Even though the suffrage movement was starting to gain support all over the country, Black women faced other challenges. Many white people during this time did not believe the two races should be treated equally, and many men did not think women should be treated equally to them. Therefore, Black women were fighting for both racial and gender equality, and often didn’t have a voice.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But that didn’t stop Black suffragists. For instance, Charlotte “Lottie” Rollin, the daughter of mixed-race parents, led the South Carolina chapter of the American Woman Suffrage Association. In 1869, she spoke in front of the South Carolina House of Representatives about voting rights for everyone, and in 1871, she wrote an article for the suffrage group’s newspaper that read:

“We ask suffrage not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the grounds that we are human beings and as such entitled to all human rights.”

Stronger together

In 1890 the two suffrage groups merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association. They would work together to win over the states.

But Black women weren’t always included. The national organization didn’t exclude them, but local groups could choose to segregate, or separate by race, their groups. Often, Black women were left out of conventions and had to march separately in parades.

So they started their own groups. In 1892, Helen Appo Cook founded the National League of Colored Women. In 1893, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin established the Women’s Era Club to address issues affecting the Black community; in 1895, she and her daughter, Florida Ridley, organized the first National Conference of Colored Women. At that gathering, leaders established the National Federation of Afro-American Women.

In 1896, all three organizations for Black women merged into the National Association for Colored Women with the motto “Lifting As We Climb.” Under the leadership of Mary Church Terrell, the group had similar goals as the mostly white suffrage organization. But they also supported voting rights for Black men, who, despite the 15th Amendment, still faced challenges.

Not-so-peaceful protests

The movement for women’s suffrage wasn’t always peaceful. In the early 1900s, women started using methods that they thought would bring more attention to the cause, and they were often punished for expressing their opinions.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

For instance, throughout 1917, 218 women from 26 different states were arrested for picketing outside the White House in Washington, D.C. One of them was suffragist Alice Paul, who led a thousand women in the silent protest starting in January that year. She and her fellow protesters were yelled at and struck by people who were against suffrage. Police arrested Paul and others for “obstructing traffic on the sidewalks.” In jail, they were served worm-infested food and slept on dirty beds, and Paul even went on a hunger strike until doctors forced her to eat.

Many other women were treated the same way for fighting for equal rights. But it was worth it to them to keep the movement on people’s minds.

Votes for women

On April 6, 1917, the United States entered World War I. Many men went to Europe to fight, and many women volunteered there as nurses. Women also filled jobs in the states that had been held by the men now overseas. Realizing how important women were, President Woodrow Wilson changed his mind about the suffrage movement and started supporting women’s right to vote.

The president proposed the 19th Amendment to Congress in 1918; it would require three-quarters of the states to ratify the amendment. (At the time, the United States had 48 states.) Thanks to years of work by the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the National Association for Colored Women, many states—such as New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan—had already adopted women’s suffrage and were early to ratify the amendment. In 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state to support the cause. The 19th Amendment was officially ratified, and women in the United States finally had the right to vote.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The movement continues

The work of suffragists in the 1800s and 1900s lives on.

In 1935, Mary McLeod Bethune, the daughter of former enslaved people, founded the National Council of Negro Women to advocate for more equal opportunities for Black women in housing, education, employment, and healthcare. The organization still exists today.

In 1972, thanks to the ongoing strong voices from women, Congress passed Title IX, a law that makes it illegal for schools to discriminate based on gender.

https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-road-to-school-desegregation,"Six-year-old Ruby Bridges walked up the steps to her new school on November 14, 1960. It was her first day at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ruby’s mother had walked with her, but they weren’t alone

Four U.S. federal marshals were with Ruby, too. They were there to protect her from the angry crowd of people at the school who didn’t want Ruby there. Why? She was the first African American student to attend an all-white elementary school in the South.

At the time, many schools—especially in Southern states—were segregated, meaning that Black children attended different schools from white kids. Even though this had been against the law since 1954, it was still happening at William Frantz Elementary when she integrated, or attended school with children of different races.

People had been fighting against school segregation for many years, ever since the first laws to separate Black and white students were passed after the Civil War. It would take many brave people—including children like Ruby—to make people see that the laws did not provide equal education for all children and needed to change.

A long road ahead

Before the Civil War (1861-1865), enslaved children were not allowed to attend school. Soon after the war ended, the U.S. government required former slaveholding states that had fought against the Union to educate both white and Black children. Then, in 1868, Congress passed the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed every citizen equal rights and protection under the law—including equal access to education.

Not everyone agreed with these decisions. Southern leaders did not want Black people to have the same rights as white people. So most Southern states adopted a group of laws in the late 1870s, called Jim Crow laws, to segregate Black and white people. Throughout the South, nearly all public places—restaurants, parks, movie theaters, trains, swimming pools, schools, and even drinking fountains—were separated by race. It was because of these new laws that Black children could not attend the same schools as white children in the South.

Separate but not equal

Despite the 14th Amendment, Southern states were able to legally segregate Black and white children because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision from 1896 called Plessy vs. Ferguson. After Homer Plessy, a Black man, tried to sit in a whites-only train car, the court ruled that as long as Black and white people were treated equally, they could be separated by race. This became known as “separate but equal.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But “separate but equal"" wasn’t truly equal—conditions in places meant for Black people were usually much worse than those for white people. For instance, Black schools often had leaking roofs, sagging floors, and windows without glass. They were also overcrowded, with too many students per teacher and not enough desks or books. If books were available, they were old, outdated ones from white schools.

Black families knew that if they wanted their children to have an equal education that these laws needed to change. And the only way to do that was through the U.S. Supreme Court.

Hope for equality

In 1951, eight-year-old Linda Brown was not allowed to attend an all-white elementary school in Topeka, Kansas. Her father, Oliver Brown, did not think this was fair and filed a lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Around the same time, four other lawsuits challenging school segregation had been filed, so in 1952, the Supreme Court combined all of them into one. The justices would decide once and for all if schools could separate students based on the color of their skin.

Thurgood Marshall—who would later become the first African American Supreme Court justice—represented the five children and their families in a case called Brown vs. Board of Education. He argued that segregation was not equal and was actually harmful to children. The court agreed. On May 17, 1954, every single justice decided that racial segregation of children in public schools was unconstitutional, which meant that separating children in public schools by race went against what had been outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

School segregation was now against the law. States were ordered to begin desegregating their public schools. But changes were slow to come.

The Little Rock Nine

Some school districts defied the 1954 order by not integrating immediately or simply doing nothing. Other school boards purposefully delayed integration by years by integrating only one grade each year. Other white parents refused to send their children to integrated schools or held angry protests that were sometimes violent to prevent Black children from registering.

To help move integration along, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) decided to recruit a group of nine Black students to integrate Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The teenagers gathered on September 4, 1957, to enter the school. But the governor had called in the Arkansas National Guard, which blocked them from entering the building.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The story made headlines across America, and many people were outraged that Southern states were still defying the Supreme Court ruling. A few weeks later, on September 25, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered federal troops to escort the students—now known as the Little Rock Nine—into the school. This time the students' integration efforts were successful.

The fight continues

After the Little Rock Nine, more and more Black families courageously started sending their children to all-white schools. It wasn’t an easy decision for parents to make, since kids often faced bullying and loneliness. For instance, Ruby Bridges often sat in class with only her teacher because white parents didn’t want their children in school with a Black student. Even Vice President Kamala Harris was part of a program in 1970 to bus children far from their neighborhoods to integrate schools in Berkeley, California.

Racial inequalities in the nation’s school system still exist today, more than 65 years after the Brown decision. Schools in wealthier, mostly white neighborhoods sometimes have better technology, higher-quality books, and smaller class sizes; schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods with more people of color sometimes have older or broken computers, overcrowded classes, and buildings in need of repair.

But people continue to speak out against these inequalities and fight for equal education for all students. As former President Barack Obama said, “In the years to come, we must continue striving toward equal opportunities for all our children. … Because when children learn and play together, they grow, build, and thrive together.”",World

https://news.nationalgeographic.org/national-geographic-society-and-rolex-announce-ambitious-exploration-encompassing-all-five-regions-of-the-global-ocean/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 3, 2025) — Today, the National Geographic Society and Rolex are proud to announce the launch of Perpetual Planet Ocean Expeditions — a series of trailblazing scientific research expeditions across the world’s ocean from seashore to seafloor and from pole to pole.

Supported by Rolex as part of its Perpetual Planet Initiative and anchored by National Geographic Explorers, the field research expeditions to all five ocean basins — the Arctic, Pacific, Southern, Atlantic and Indian — will integrate cutting-edge science and local ecological knowledge to examine the causes and impacts of marine systems change while developing bold and innovative solutions in collaboration with coastal communities.

“There is so much of the ocean that has yet to be studied,” says Ian Miller, chief science and innovation officer at the National Geographic Society. “Through our long-standing partnership with Rolex, we have launched groundbreaking scientific expeditions of mountain and rainforest systems and now, by investigating ocean systems change on a global scale, Perpetual Planet Ocean Expeditions will address critical gaps in our understanding of our planet’s largest ecosystem and develop solutions to protect it.”

The impact of the ocean on our world cannot be understated. Covering an estimated 70% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean provides roughly half of the planet’s oxygen, regulates the global climate, is a critical carbon sink, a vital source of food and medicine, makes up over 90% of the planet’s biosphere, and is an important economic driver.

Collaborating across the entire ocean, 20 National Geographic Explorers, along with educators, storytellers and coastal communities, are investigating an array of subjects including algae in sea ice, Antarctic krill, methane seeps, benthic communities, wildlife health, marine biodiversity and food webs, coral reef health, and coastal mangroves. Explorers and coastal communities will integrate scientific research and local ecological knowledge to advance conservation and protection solutions for a changing ocean.

In response to the urgent nature of the myriad issues facing the ocean, some of Perpetual Planet Ocean Expeditions’ work has already begun and will continue to expand as other projects get underway over the next two years.

National Geographic Explorer and deep-sea expert Katy Croff Bell recently led a groundbreaking study, “How Little We've Seen: A Visual Coverage Estimate of the Deep Seafloor,” revealing that despite decades of deep-sea exploration, only 0.001% of the deep seafloor has been visually observed. Coastal communities on the frontlines of experiencing the effects of increasing sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels and stronger storm surges are often hindered by a lack of access to scientific research and data collection technologies. Approximately 87% of these coastal communities’ waters are deep ocean, and current technologies limit their ability to understand and manage the ocean resources at their doorstep. To fill this critical gap, Bell has developed low-cost, accessible deep-sea research and exploration systems and is collaborating with other Explorers and coastal communities worldwide to deploy them, thereby expanding the field of deep-sea exploration.

National Geographic Explorers Aaron Micallef, Allison Fong, Andrew Thurber, Angelo Bernardino, Catherine Ribeiro, Cristian Lagger, Jane Younger, Kim Bernard and their team members conducted an interdisciplinary scientific examination of the region in and around the Southern Ocean’s Weddell Sea via a groundbreaking sea ice to seafloor transect over 21 days. The multidisciplinary team of 24 scientists, storytellers and educators with expertise in oceanography, marine ecology, climate science, geology, wildlife health and migration, and community-based conservation documented vital marine processes in this critical region. National Geographic Explorer and photographer Luján Agusti documented the expedition’s work, and Lyanne Abreu, an educator and Grosvenor Teacher Fellow, accompanied the expedition to help expand the reach of the scientific work into classrooms. Their observations will deepen our understanding of this ecosystem while informing conservation efforts. The expedition was conducted in collaboration with the Schmidt Ocean Institute, which provided National Geographic Explorers the opportunity to leverage the state-of-the-art tools and capabilities of the 110-meter global ocean-class R/V Falkor (too) during its maiden voyage to the Southern Ocean.

National Geographic Explorer Kristina Brown is working in the Sherman Basin, located in the Kitikmeot Sea in the southern Canadian Arctic, a region of critical importance to the marine food security of the local Inuit. Brown has been conducting oceanographic studies on board the Arctic Research Foundation’s R/V Martin Bergmann and is collaborating closely with the community of Gjoa Haven in an effort to inform best practices for sustaining food security in the face of a rapidly changing and warming Arctic.

In the Pacific Ocean’s Cook Islands, National Geographic Explorer Anya Brown is investigating how certain corals remain resilient to heat stress while others don’t, and how corals may work together to boost overall heat tolerance in the reef system. She is working with local NGO Kōrero O Te `Ōrau to inform the restoration of Rarotonga’s reefs and increase their resilience to future coral bleaching events.

National Geographic Explorer Sheena Talma is leading the first locally driven deep-ocean expedition in her home country of Seychelles. She will work with local and international collaborators to deploy custom-built deep-sea camera systems to collect critical marine wildlife data in key fishing areas within Seychelles’ waters. This groundbreaking research will inform sustainable fisheries management and deepen understanding of the region’s largely unexplored deep-sea ecosystems.

National Geographic Explorers Margaret Awuor Owuor and Maiyai Taal Hocheimy will launch an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of The Gambia to investigate how a changing ocean is affecting the mangroves at the mouth of the Gambia River and their ability to provide food security and protection against the impacts of sea level rise for coastal communities. This multidisciplinary expedition, which includes ecosystem resource mapping and biodiversity studies, will represent one of the first oceanographic data gathering efforts for the Atlantic Ocean spanning the Gambian coastline.

The Polynesian Voyaging Society has embarked on “Moananuiākea: Voyage for Earth” around the Pacific Ocean on their voyaging canoe Hōkūleʻa and her sister canoe Hikianalia using traditional wayfinding techniques to foster fluency in ocean knowledge. National Geographic Explorers and navigators Nainoa Thompson, Lehua Kamalu and the crew will incorporate marine data collection into daily sailing protocols. The voyage provides a unique opportunity to leverage the canoes in bringing together local expertise of the island communities with cutting-edge scientific research tools throughout the vast Pacific waters to advance conservation and protection solutions for a changing ocean.

National Geographic Explorer, storyteller and 2024 Pulitzer Prize Finalist Hannah Reyes Morales will document the lives of coastal communities, their local ecological knowledge, and their collaboration with Explorers to develop scientific and community-based conservation solutions.

The objectives and outcomes of the Perpetual Planet Ocean Expeditions will deepen our understanding of this essential ecosystem while generating powerful solutions in support of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.

https://news.nationalgeographic.org/the-national-geographic-society-and-cengage-group-celebrate-expanded-partnership-with-the-announcement-of-a-new-interactive-student-experience-at-the-museum-of-exploration/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 29, 2025) — The National Geographic Society and Cengage Group have expanded their long-term partnership with a $15 million gift in support of the National Geographic Museum of Exploration, opening in 2026. The National Geographic Learning Launchpad, powered by the Cengage Group, is an extraordinary interactive space that will inspire young people to connect with the concept of geographic thinking and to apply what they learn to their own lives.

The National Geographic Learning Launchpad will be the first stop for the student groups visiting the Museum of Exploration at National Geographic Base Camp in Washington, D.C., setting the scene for their experience at the museum. The space — which includes an introductory corridor, interactive activity room and immersive projection room — presents geography as a way of thinking, understanding and interacting with the world. Visitors will learn to ask questions and seek knowledge, think critically and creatively to solve the world’s most pressing problems and to understand the Explorer Mindset — a series of attributes, shared values and commitments that define what it means to be a National Geographic Explorer.

https://news.nationalgeographic.org/builders-vision-and-the-national-geographic-society-announce-a-new-program-focused-on-storytelling-for-healthy-oceans/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 22, 2025) — Today, Builders Vision and the National Geographic Society are proud to announce a new program that will amplify the voices of people, organizations and communities driving transformative change in ocean ecosystems. The program will support National Geographic Explorers and storytellers from around the world who are raising critical awareness about the perils facing our world’s oceans, exploring novel ways that individuals and communities are seeking to address them, and revealing the societal and economic benefits of protecting our waters.

Through the combination of Builders Vision’s holistic approach to systems change and the Society’s expertise in science, exploration, education and storytelling to inspire action, the two organizations are uniquely positioned to shift perspectives and catalyze lasting change toward a more resilient future. Together, National Geographic and Builders Vision seek to support and amplify the work of some of the world’s most innovative changemakers looking to build a healthier, more sustainable world.

“The ocean conservation community is strongest when visionary partners and changemakers come together with bold, creative plans for impact — and this collaboration does just that,” said Jill Tiefenthaler, CEO of the National Geographic Society. “We’re proud to work with Builders Vision to support National Geographic Explorers as they tell the ocean’s stories through fresh, global perspectives that can spark change and inspire a brighter future for our ocean.”

The collaboration will include three core elements: offering Builders Vision ocean partners the opportunity to participate in National Geographic Storytellers Collective workshops, creating a global storytelling program that amplifies the work of National Geographic Explorers addressing urgent ocean challenges and innovations, and identifying pivotal moments to convene investors and sustainability leaders to drive forward critical discussions and solutions for ocean health and resilience.

“The viability of our ocean system is dependent on our ability to inform and inspire decision-makers to mobilize their capital into more sustainable solutions,” said Lukas Walton, Founder and CEO at Builders Vision. “Who better to support that mission than National Geographic and its incredible Explorers? The heart of our collaboration is all about harnessing the power of storytelling and lifting up the voices of those driving the innovative solutions needed to ensure a sustainable, thriving ocean.”

The storytelling program will support three National Geographic Explorers with grants to uncover and share bold, untold stories that bring critical blue economy challenges and solutions into focus, igniting urgency and sparking meaningful progress:

Malin Fezehai Fezehai is a photographer, filmmaker and visual journalist who has reported extensively across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Americas. In this project, she will examine how communities around the Indian Ocean — the fastest-warming ocean on Earth — are confronting the impacts of climate change. From Kenya to the Maldives, the work highlights local initiatives to restore ecosystems and protect coastal livelihoods. By connecting these stories, the project aims to inspire global audiences to recognize the interconnectedness of ocean ecosystems and the essential role frontline communities play in safeguarding our planet’s future.

Shireen Rahimi Rahimi is an underwater visual storyteller, marine scientist, and science communicator. Her practice weaves together western science and ancient wisdom to inspire action for our oceans and climate. For her project, Rahimi will produce the pilot episode for a hosted docuseries. The series will highlight communities worldwide that are harnessing the power of the ocean to ensure a livable future on this planet. The first episode will spotlight coral reefs and the innovative solutions that offer hope for their survival.

Brian Skerry Skerry is a film producer, director and veteran photojournalist specializing in marine wildlife and underwater realms. Since 1998, Skerry has been a contributing photographer for National Geographic magazine, where he has created and photographed more than 30 feature stories, including seven cover stories. Skerry’s project will focus on and visually highlight two vital elements of the blue economy — the value of sharks as a key species to ocean ecosystem health, and creating new businesses through the harvesting of an invasive species and kelp aquaculture for skin care products.



Contributing an estimated $2.5 trillion annually to the global economy and supporting the livelihoods of over 3 billion people residing in vulnerable coastal areas, the ocean is more in need than ever of programs that contribute to creating a sustainable, healthy blue economy that fosters long-term resilience to climate change, elevate the economic prosperity of coastal communities, and ensure the responsible stewardship of ocean and coastal ecosystems.

Explore a temple rebornThailand’s capital city is an intoxicating blend of old and new. At its heart are glittering skyscrapers mixing with luxury shopping malls like Siam Center and upscale hotels like Innside by Meliá Sukhumvit While the city is an art and design hot spot in its own right—with popups and festivals like the Bangkok Art Biennale and the Bangkok International Film Festival, centered around the burgeoning Bang Rak neighborhood —it’s also a hub from which tourists can access Thailand’s rich cultural heritage.Just outside the city lies one of the country’s most important monuments: Wat Chaiwatthanaram, a 17th-century Buddhist temple. The wat’s graceful architecture features a large, central prang—a Khmer-style pagoda—that is surrounded by smaller prangs and symbolizes Mount Sumeru, the sacred mountain at the center of the world in Buddhist mythology. But catastrophic flooding in 2011 and monsoon rains caused heavy damage. Ongoing restoration work has included 3D laser scanning the entire structure and building a new flood wall to preserve the temple and transform it into an educational site on Thailand’s cultural heritage.",World
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/best-whisky-distilleries-to-visit-in-scotland,"This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).

Pagoda chimneys rising above pine-forested glens, the babble of a highland spring, the distinctive aroma of toasted malt — distilleries are far more than functional factories. Often set in spectacular settings, they’re crucibles of living, breathing Scottish heritage. And many invite visitors inside to view bubbling mash tuns, gleaming copper stills and warehouses filled with oak barrels, revealing the almost alchemical process that turns a few simple, local ingredients — barley, yeast, spring water — into fiery, golden spirits.

Monasteries were Scotland’s first de facto distilleries, putting rain-soaked grain to good use, with the earliest recorded mention of this ‘water of life’ (uisge beatha in Gaelic) dating from 1494. Today, there are over 150 active distilleries nationwide, falling into five officially recognised regions. Covering much of the mainland and islands, Highland is the largest and most diverse, while Speyside carves out a slice of the north east, and Lowlands lies just north of the English border. The peat-heavy Hebridean island of Islay gets its own designation, as does Campbeltown, a wee, southwesterly peninsula.

Visitor experiences run the gamut from rustic, hard-hat tours to bespoke ‘bottle your own single-malt cask’ offerings — and some of these are seriously high-end. The Glenrothes private estate’s multi-day experience, for example, costs a whopping £250,000. Most tastings will offer ‘drivers’ drams’ — miniature pours to take home — meaning whoever’s behind the wheel doesn’t miss out. And with more distilleries adding restaurants, bars or overnight stays, even Scotch sceptics can find something to savour.

1. Deanston Distillery, Doune, Perthshire

Small in size, but big on character, Deanston’s unpretentious, experimental attitude has resulted in waxy, honeyed, full-bodied drams with a cult following — including a 15-year-old single malt finished in tequila casks. Deanston even looks different to most distilleries — the red-brick, riverside buildings were in fact an 18th-century cotton mill, before they were converted to whisky-making in 1966. The place still hums with hydropower: one of the greenest scotch brands around, the whisky here is made from organic grain sourced from local farmers. Book the Warehouse No 4 experience, in Deanston’s former cooperage, for direct-from-cask tastings and an atmospheric whisky-ageing education. Or compare some of its Master Blender’s favourite, hard-to-find past releases on the Old & Rare Tasting.

How to do it: £25 per person (Distillery Tour); £40 per person (Warehouse No 4 Experience); £130 per person (Old & Rare Tasting).

2. The Macallan, Craigellachie, Moray

There’s a hint of Bond villain's lair about this Speyside distillery’s sleek, subterranean architecture, which has been the brand’s home since 2018, rippling beneath a wildflower-covered roof (fittingly, the 007 movies feature a few Macallan cameos). Within cathedral-height interiors, an interactive archive showcases 200 years of whisky-making heritage and limited-edition bottles, which resemble artworks. The central bar serves drams dating back 80 years, classic cocktails and tutored tastings — The Story of Oak, for instance, compares how sherry-seasoned casks impart Macallan’s signature notes of dried fruits, ginger and cinnamon. Its culinary credentials are also next level: the team have collaborated with Spain’s three-Michelin-starred El Celler de Can Roca at its fine-dining restaurant TimeSpirit, and The Macallan Mastery Experience tour concludes with a six-course tasting menu here. All this makes The Macallan the cream of Speyside visitor experiences — no mean feat given this region has the highest concentration of distilleries.

How to do it: £50 per person (The Story of Oak); £250 per person (The Macallan Mastery Experience).

3. Port Ellen, Islay

Islay punches above its weight with powerful, peat-rich styles and nine active distilleries. Alongside established names like Lagavulin and Laphroaig, the buzz is all about Port Ellen: this Kilnaughton Bay landmark reopened in 2024 after a 40-year closure and £185m makeover. It’s a dazzling, steel-and-glass temple to carbon-neutral whisky innovation, where handbuilt replicas of original copper stills stand beside the world’s first 10-part spirit safe and a Scandi-chic, ocean-view tasting lounge. While new expressions are maturing, aficionados can nose the distilleries new-make spirit and draw from a 1979 vintage cask on the Port Ellen Reborn tour, uncovering the mineral, smoky soul of this phoenix-like brand.

How to do it: Book well in advance for free, monthly open days (reservations essential); £250 per person (Port Ellen Reborn).

4. Talisker, Carbost, Isle of Skye

Overlooking a sea loch on the myth-steeped Isle of Skye, Talisker’s peaty whiskies are as rugged and elemental as its setting. Take the classic 10-Year-Old: a bracing ocean breeze on the nose, followed by black pepper and bonfire smoke. No wonder Talisker was one of Robert Louis Stevenson’s reasons for calling whisky ‘the king o’ drinks’. Thanks to big investment from international drinks powerhouse Diageo, Talisker’s raft of visitor experiences goes well beyond classic tours, including chocolate and whisky-pairing tastings, an offshoot of Michelin-recommended restaurant The Three Chimneys and a state-of-the-art visitor centre for multi-sensory storytelling about Talisker’s wave-lashed heritage. Linger in the Campfire Bar for a dram or whisky-based cocktail — the venue sometimes hosts live folk music sets, too.

How to do it: £20 per person (Talisker Made By The Sea Tasting Experience); £35 per person (Whisky & Chocolate Tasting).

5. Springbank, Campbeltown, Argyll

In its Victorian heyday, Campbeltown was hailed as the world’s whisky capital and was home to 32 distilleries within one tiny patch of Argyll’s Atlantic-lashed Kintyre Peninsula. That figure’s now fallen to just three, making family-owned Springbank both survivor and standard-bearer — notably, it’s one of Scotland’s only distilleries to complete 100% of the whisky-making process on site, from floor malting to bottling. The briny, oily character of Springbank’s signature single malt — layered with smoky, grassy notes — reflects its coastal location, and the original 1828 building is an atmospheric labyrinth of cobbled courtyards and coal-fired kilns. Out of its various tours and tastings, Barley to Bottle is the most hands-on, access-all-areas option, letting guests create their own bottle of whisky in the Blending Laboratory, followed by a seafood lunch.

How to do it: £15 per person (standard tour); £250 per person (Barley to Bottle).

6. Auchentoshan, Clydebank, Glasgow

With its delicate, floral profile, Auchentoshan’s sometimes dubbed ‘the breakfast whisky’, as well as ‘Glasgow's malt’, since the city’s only a 20-minute drive away. Whisky newbies and sweet tooths can often be converted by its lighter, creme brulee character. That silkiness and clarity is the result of triple distillation — a process Lowland whiskies are renowned for — and the Auchentoshan Ultimate Tour details each stage. The space itself is fittingly clean-lined, light-filled and refined, with windows framing the Kilpatrick Hills.

There was a time when a perfunctory potter round the key sites with a dusty guide serviced by an even dustier script was the summit of our city-tour ambitions. Now, driven by a new breed of innovative and passionate advocates eager to exalt their home towns, the choice is boundless. Whether you’re looking to scratch the surface of a destination or really get under its skin, you won’t struggle to find a tour as unique, compelling and fun as the guides who lead them. Here, we celebrate a selection of the latter — from a retired policeman on a very different beat in London to a Barcelona ‘sightjogger’ and a kayaker offering an unusual take on the City of Bridges.

Kayak tour of Venice with Ginevra Testa

Visitors to Venice have been getting out on the water for centuries. But while the cliche features a strapping gondolier, a glass or two of something chilled and some weighty expectations of romance, the waterborne craft in which Ginevra Testa plies her trade are somewhat different. The 26-year-old guides her guests around the labyrinthine waterways of the city of her birth in one- or two-person kayaks. Romance is in short supply (no one looks good in a spray skirt and watershoes). But other than that, the tours couldn’t be more in tune with Venice’s character.

“What I love is the different perspective the tours offer,” says Ginevra, who’s one of seven guides working for Venice Kayak. Groups are limited to six people, so there’s plenty of contact with each individual, and tours run in the late afternoon and early evening. “During the day, it’s all about seeing the architecture of Venice and the extraordinary buildings. Meanwhile, the evening tour is much more about the colours in the sky and the reflections off the water,” says Ginevra. “It can be so beautiful — it’s not uncommon to have people in tears.”

Venice wasn’t always the ‘City of Bridges’ — early settlers in the lagoon had no choice but to travel by boat between its 100-plus islands. In that respect, the 2.5-hour kayak tours offer a return to its original spirit. Working with the gondolas — and the gondoliers who expertly and theatrically propel them — is all in a day’s work. Over recent years, a mutual understanding has developed, with the gondoliers recognising that the kayak tours might include inexperienced paddlers, and thus giving them a wide berth; and the kayak guides sensitive to the fact that flailing paddles aren’t the most welcome addition to a gondola selfie. Both groups are united against what many feel is the principal scourge of Venice’s waterways — the wash-generating, sediment-displacing motorboats.

While this most fragile of urban environments benefits from the low-impact tourism that kayaking tours offer, participants can enjoy something that Venice certainly isn’t awash with: freedom of movement. The tiny walkways, elegant bridges and cobbled streets around in-demand sites such as the Grand Canal, St Mark’s Basilica and the Teatro La Fenice place a premium on sharp elbows; afloat, the pace is less hurried and more serene.

“It’s much closer to the experience you would have as someone who lives here year-round,” says Ginevra. “The biggest change during my lifetime is that Venice has become… faster. People dashing around, ticking off the main sites and landmarks. With our tours, you’re exploring hidden waterways and getting the chance to hear, see and admire more of the real Venice at the right pace.”

It’s a symbiotic process. As Ginevra is showing off her city to visitors, unseen corners are revealing themselves to her. “I thought I knew everything about Venice,” she says. “But doing this job, it makes me fall in love with it all over again.”

From €110 (£94) per person.

“The weather in Barcelona is great all year round, so there’s really no reason not to be active,” says Mattia Giannini, who offers a range of distances on his sight-jogging tours, from 5km to 21km Photograph by Getty Images, Pol Albarrán

Running tour of Barcelona with Mattia Giannini

Escaping a nine-to-five, desk-bound existence was Mattia Giannini’s motivation for lacing up his trainers and becoming a running-tour guide. Now he finds himself working for just a few hours each morning — and his office is one of the world’s most breathlessly invigorating cities: Barcelona.

Tours start early; all the better for avoiding the rising temperatures and touristic tide that can engulf the Catalan capital later in the day, particularly in high summer. But the early starts are no penance. “It’s such a beautiful time of day in Barcelona,” says the 31-year-old. There’s a soft light illuminating the Gaudí masterpieces, such as La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. The skeletal frames of the retro-funfair rides high on Mount Tibidabo lie dormant. And the arc of golden sand of La Barceloneta beach is specked with just a handful of early risers.

“The weather in Barcelona is great all year round, so there’s really no reason not to be active,” says Mattia. He offers a range of distances on his sight-jogging tours, from 5km to 21km — the latter popular with visitors prepping for marathons or half marathons. The 10km is the most popular; Mattia is proud of the route he’s mapped out for this, claiming it shows clients “80% of the highlights of the city” in double-quick time, providing a great foundation for later exploration. With keen runners, the 10km might only last an hour. Others will take considerably longer. But the golden rule is: no one gets left behind.

“I sometimes get clients who say ‘yeah, I can run 10km or 21km’ and then it transpires that they’re not really in the shape for it. If that happens, then I make a plan; we either walk for sections, cut short the distance or I’ve sometimes grabbed one of the city bikes that you can rent and got them on one of those so they don’t miss out. As I always say, ‘you’re here to have fun — there’s no point in dying to see Barcelona!”

Trail-running isn’t really Mattia’s thing, so for clients keen to explore the paths and trails around Montjuïc, a focal point for the transformative 1992 Olympic Games, and further afield, he deploys his secret weapon: his partner Mari. “She’s a very strong runner — stronger than me. She recently did the Barcelona Marathon and she loves all the trails, so she takes care of that side of things.”

Like this super-active couple, Barcelona finds itself in rude health, with the cultural, architectural and sporting regeneration that began with the 1992 Games continuing apace. But how do Mattia’s tours coexist with two pursuits for which the Catalan capital has become renowned in recent years: tapas-based gastronomic overindulgence, and partying into the early hours? He laughs. “It’s not uncommon to have, say, a group of four booked for an early 10km run and only two turn up. It’s often because they’re still in bed, sleeping it off. But that’s absolutely fair enough. When it comes to my city, that’s all part of the game.”

From £80; groups from £45 per person.

Craft beer tour of Berlin with Alex Schmidt

“I’m what you might call a beer nerd,” says Alex Schmidt, as he relaxes in his home city of Berlin after waving off his most recent group. Alex started the business nearly eight years ago with his wife, Margot. He was finishing his Master’s and had a background in cultural anthropology; she was in business marketing. “Basically we decided to fuse together our skill sets to offer tours of a city we love — the Berlin that Berliners know,” says Alex. This meant less-visited neighbourhoods with independent businesses, quirky shops and... microbreweries.

His experiences couldn’t be further from the overpromoted pub crawls that pass for tours in certain European capitals; in Germany, the evolution of brewing and beer is deeply interlaced with the country’s culture, and it’s this that Alex prioritises. Eight tastings are included on the 3.5-hour tour, which heads to the atmospheric, art-adorned streets of Friedrichshain, a former East Berlin district that’s emerged as a beer-lover’s paradise.

He’s always surprised at the diversity of clients: all ages and genders, and an increasing number of alcohol-free converts who are visibly surprised at the quality and range of the alcohol-free craft beers on offer at the breweries and ‘brewpubs’ he incorporates in his tour.

Whatever you come for, it’s a great time to be exploring the German capital, says Alex. “The last 15 to 20 years have seen a real boost. Start-ups, big investment, the development of a thriving food and drink scene. But within that you still have certain ruins in the middle of the city that haven’t been developed — these weird, lost, remarkable places that offer space for subcultures to develop.”

From €99 (£85) per person.

Police tour of London with Francis Mullan

Frustration at the hackneyed limitations of London’s police and crime tours led Francis Mullan to take matters into his own hands. “It was always the same: the Krays and Jack the bloody Ripper!” he says, with exasperation. “So we decided to offer something a bit more sophisticated and authentic.”

Francis certainly had the credentials. Prior to setting up his London Police and Crime Walking Tour with former colleague David Norton, the Londoner was a copper himself for 30 years, working as both a bobby on the beat and a detective.

Starting in Covent Garden, the tour features an eclectic mix of historical, fictional and contemporary sites and stories, including Great Scotland Yard, with its famous revolving sign, a Sherlock Holmes-inspired pub and Bow Street Magistrates Court. The Great Scotland Yard Hotel, which opened in 2019, is a quirky inclusion. It’s set in the building that was the 19th-century headquarters of the Metropolitan Police and boasts a collection of policing artefacts — “truncheons, uniforms, that sort of stuff,” says Francis.

You’re either a policeman, or a former policeman, he explains — “it’s not a job you ever really leave behind.” This ensures he enjoys plenty of rapport with serving officers, who he’ll often bump into en route. “I’ll say what I’m doing and most of the time they’re happy to chat to the group,” says the 65-year-old.

The pace of the walking tour is relaxed and the distances short. “I can generally wrap it up in two hours, 15 minutes,” he says. “It’s strange but there’s this enduring fascination with law and order. Everyone wants to know what it’s like to serve.”

From £30 per person.

Classic car tour of Monaco with Patrick Riem

To stand out in the land of conspicuous wealth is no easy task, but Patrick Riem found a way. The super rich who flock to the tiny principality in their superyachts and supercars often find themselves casting covetous glances at Patrick’s fleet of diminutive electric cars modelled on the classic racers of the 1930s — then signing up for one of his tours. Sometimes, several.

“One guy who was in town on his superyacht booked a 90-minute tour in the morning, another in the afternoon, then came back for a third in the evening,” says Patrick. The head-turning cars are manufactured by a French company called Devinci Automobiles and are zippy, soundless, ecological — and an implausible amount of fun to drive. “It’s not going to give you a heart attack when you step on the gas, like the Bugattis and Lamborghinis you see here,” says Patrick. “But it’s a very cool car.”

There’s a varied menu, from 20-minute pootles to 90-minute grand tours. Patrick leads the way, with clients following in convoy. Monaco’s dazzling beaches, the Hotel de Paris, the Prince’s Palace and the balcony-like coastal road immortalised in multiple Bond movies are just some of the spots that feature. The 60-year-old Monegasque businessman has grown fond of the Devinci cars and loves the way they complement the principality and its racing heritage. “Of all the things Monaco is known for, I believe the Grand Prix is the most prized. All the greatest drivers have driven on these narrow streets and through the chicanes, and you can, too — in a car that fits the architecture and feel of Monaco. It’s La Belle Époque on wheels.”

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/unesco-world-heritage-sites-filming-locations,"In 1989, the appearance of Petra’s ancient tomb known as the Treasury [Al-Khazneh] in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade electrified moviegoers. Following the film’s release, annual attendance at Jordan’s formerly obscure UNESCO World Heritage Site skyrocketed—reaching nearly a million visitors by 2010. Today, the link between the haunting, rock-faced tombs and the Hollywood blockbuster continues to capture the attention of set-jetters.

""In the movie, Petra is a prop, a backdrop to Indiana Jones,"" says Las Vegas resident Andy Hines who visited last April and was struck by the remnants of the vanished Nabatean Kingdom. ""But see it in person, and Petra becomes the star, allowing you to appreciate the site’s full, rich historical context ""

Petra isn’t the only UNESCO site to enjoy celluloid celebrity. Hollywood has scouted and used dozens of designated cultural wonders as dramatic backdrops, transforming these locales into must-see and must-do destinations—part of a growing trend called set-jetting, that draws travelers to places appearing in hit movies and TV shows. The following list blends cultural significance with cinematic nostalgia—an irresistible draw for travelers seeking meaningful summer vacations.

1. Kenya Lake System in the Great Rift Valley

Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa forever linked Kenya's dramatic landscapes with epic romance. The UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site of the Kenya Lake System, designated in 2011, features prominently in the film's sweeping aerial shots of the Great Rift Valley, Ngong Hills, and most famously, Robert Redford and Meryl Streep’s biplane buzzing Lake Nakuru with its iconic, if terrified, pink flamingos. The three alkaline lakes (Elementaita, Nakuru, and Bogoria) support exceptional populations of lesser flamingos and other migratory birds. Based on Karen Blixen's memoir of running a coffee plantation in colonial Kenya, the 1985 film's panoramic vistas helped define the visual language of the romantic African safari. Today, visitors can experience scenic viewpoints along the Great Rift Valley escarpment and flamingo-flocking at Lake Nakuru National Park. The region’s luxury lodges will deliver an Out of Africa experience for a price.

2. Tongariro National Park, New Zealand

Few film franchises have transformed a country’s global image more completely than The Lord of the Rings did for New Zealand. Tongariro National Park, with its dual World Heritage status (natural and cultural), was the dramatic landscape of Mordor in Peter Jackson's epic trilogy released between 2001 and 2003. Mount Ngauruhoe served as the infamous Mount Doom (filming at the summit was forbidden as the Māori people consider these volcanic peaks sacred.) Tawahi Falls created the perfect setting for Gollum's forbidden pool. The region’s profound significance to New Zealand’s first people adds cultural depth, not just a cinematic connection. The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is a rewarding day hike past sulfurous steam vents and snow-dusted volcanic peaks, though winter in the Southern Hemisphere (June to August) makes it challenging. New Zealand’s summer months—from December to February—provide better weather for travelers.

3. Historic Center of Rome, Italy

When Audrey Hepburn's Princess Ann flees her royal duties in 1953’s ""Roman Holiday,” she embarks on a Vespa-powered romance with journalist Gregory Peck, scooting past landmarks such as the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Colosseum located in the heart of the Eternal City and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. “It's not only a movie,” says art historian Isabella Calidonna, whose Archeorunning tours showcase the city’s heart while avoiding the crowds just as Hepburn and Peck tried to do. “The film captures the moment visitors discover Rome in all her alluring simplicity,” she says. “And in a time when over-tourism rules Rome, we need more of it.” Travelers can retrace the lovers’ locales, though Calidonna advises doing so in the early morning hours to avoid the crushing summertime throngs.

4. Machu Picchu, Peru

Another two-wheeled adventurer, Gael Garcia Bernal as Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, stands contemplating the 15th-century Inca citadel of Machu Picchu in The Motorcycle Diaries (2004). The scene captures a pivotal moment in the revolutionary’s formative journey across South America and his awakening to social inequalities. Designated a UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site in 1983, the Peruvian wonder serves as more than just a stunning set—it functions as a silent, brooding character. However, today’s travelers face more stringent regulations than Che did. Advance visitor permits are essential, with options ranging from the classic four-day Inca Trail hike to day trips via train from Cusco. Conservation concerns have led authorities to implement visitor caps, making early planning crucial for travelers interested in seeing the capital of the Incas.

(Go on a luxury rail journey through Peruvian mountains.)

5. Historic Center of Salzburg, Austria

Few musical moments rival Julie Andrews spinning like a gyroscope atop an Austrian Alp in The Sound of Music (1965). The Von Trapp family’s journey through Salzburg's baroque cityscape and surrounding mountains showcases why its historic center earned its UNESCO Cultural World Heritage status in 1996. The city’s Mirabell Palace Gardens, Nonnberg Abbey, and Residenzplatz became instantly recognizable to generations of viewers. Beyond the film's landmarks, visitors will discover Mozart's birthplace and other examples of the city's rich musical heritage. Dedicated Sound of Music tours remain popular, though classical music enthusiasts can opt to attend the Salzburg Festival held every summer (the Von Trapps appeared in 1936). The festival typically begins the last two weeks of July and runs through the end of August.

6. Medina of Marrakesh, Morocco

Alfred Hitchcock brought the colorful chaos of Marrakesh's ancient walled city to audiences through his thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The Medina, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Site in 1985, provides a labyrinthine backdrop for James Stewart and Doris Day's search for their kidnapped son. Locations such as Jemaa el-Fnaa Square, La Mamounia Hotel, and the twisting souks create a sensory overload perfect for Hitchcock, the master of suspense. Today, the 11th-century neighborhood with its distinctive red architecture perfumed by the competing aromas of saffron, leather, mint, and motorcycle exhaust, offers visitors an immersive and vibrant experience. Early morning and evening explorations help avoid summer’s midday heat.

7. Hanseatic City of Lübeck, Germany

F.W. Murnau's expressionist vampire film Nosferatu (1922) utilized the medieval atmosphere of Lübeck, founded in 1143 to create its haunting mood. This UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site (designated 1987) showcases the brick Gothic buildings and narrow streets of a once-powerful Hanseatic League trading center located on Germany’s Baltic coast. The Salzspeicher (salt storehouses) featured prominently in the film remain largely unchanged a century later. Still weathered by sea mists, they cast the same eerie silhouettes that gave Murnau’s vampire tale its horror.

“It looks idyllic during the day and then the light changes and these narrow little lanes become creepy crawly,” says Christel Obenaus who leads walks around Lübeck including one about the film. Self-guided tours also allow visitors to explore Gothic churches and city streets while discovering the maritime history that made it prosperous. Film fans flock to the area in November for the festival Nordic Film Days Lübeck.

(Germany’s Camino trek rivals Spain’s famous pilgrimage—and is a lot less crowded.)

8. Wadi Rum, Jordan

The vast, otherworldly landscape of Jordan’s Wadi Rum served as a location for films like Dune and The Martian but it first captivated global audiences in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). In one memorable scene, Lawrence (Peter O’Toole) takes up the invitation of tribal leader Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) to “dine with me in Wadi Rum,” the next cut reveals the UNESCO Mixed Cultural and Natural Site’s spectacular rocky scenery. There’s authentic history behind the David Lean masterpiece, as the real Lawrence passed through the region during the Arab Revolt of World War One. Today, the country’s Bedouin communities maintain ancient relationships with this challenging landscape, offering visitors authentic cultural encounters alongside natural beauty. Desert camping in front of a crackling fire beneath star-filled skies offers the most immersive experience. Tours by 4x4 provide access to a host of film locations.

(Here's what it's like to visit Jordan's Wadi Rum for the first time.)

9. Angkor Archaeological Park, Cambodia

When Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft vaulted through the temple ruins of Ta Prohm in Tomb Raider (2001), she introduced millions to the atmospheric wonders of Cambodia’s Angkor Archaeological Park. This 1992-designated UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site showcases the vast religious complexes of the Khmer Empire that ruled here between the Ninth and 15th centuries. The “Tomb Raider Temple” with its famous tree roots strangling the ancient stones like thick, gnarled tentacles, became one of the park’s most photographed locations. Visit early mornings to duck both the crowds and the intense midday heat. A multi-day pass allows visitors to go beyond the action film’s locations, discovering Angkor’s lesser-known temples. They are as compelling, but without the superstar status. In Siem Reap, an evening drink in the Elephant Bar at Raffles Grand Hotel d’Angkor offers an elegant way to beat the heat.

(These hidden temples in Cambodia will take you off the beaten path.)

10. Historic Center of Mexico City, Mexico

Lastly, perhaps the most fascinating relationship between Hollywood and UNESCO unfolded in Mexico City's Historic Center, a UNESECO Cultural Site since 1987. The opening scenes of Spectre follow Daniel Craig’s James Bond through an elaborate Day of the Dead celebration featuring giant skeleton figures and costumed crowds. The 2015 sequence showcases iconic landmarks, including the Zócalo (the city's main square), the Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico (Room 327 to be exact), and the Torre Latinoamericana, the city’s iconic 1956 skyscraper. What makes it unique is the film’s cultural impact—before Spectre, Mexico City didn't have a large-scale Day of the Dead parade like the one depicted. In a remarkable case of art influencing life, Mexican tourism authorities established an inaugural Day of the Dead parade in 2016, directly inspired by the fictional celebration created for the film. They even used some of the props and costumes from the production and referred to it as a ""Spectre-style"" parade. The event has since become an annual tradition attracting thousands of visitors.

This is the perfect route to discover the magic of Mexico’s Baja peninsula, from its pristine beaches to charming historic towns and unspoiled landscapes.

How to plan an epic road trip through Baja California

Mexico was made for road trips. Its landscapes are diverse, breathtaking, and adventure-packed, as well as filled with cultural experiences and mouthwatering cuisine. My husband and I have driven over 10,000 miles across Mexico in our RV, and while we’ve loved our year-and-a-half trip, one route stood out above the rest: the Baja California peninsula.

Jutting off from California and wedged between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California, the Baja California peninsula is the ultimate road trip for adventure seekers. The journey down Highway 1 may be rough in places, but it rewards you with sweeping coastal views, quiet beaches, dramatic desert backdrops, and unforgettable experiences.

You can sip wine in Mexico’s largest wine region, spot gray whales on a boat tour, swing in a hammock on a secluded beach, and visit a world-class beach.

Best of all, road tripping through Baja California is easily doable for U.S. and Canadian travelers. All you need is a vehicle, passport, and a plan. In this guide, I’ll share some of the best stops along the route, tips we learned from experience, and why this is one Mexican road trip you don’t want to miss.

(""Rocky, wild and unpredictable""—why Baja California is ideal off-roading country)

Prepping for the road trip

There are a few things you’ll need to prepare before hitting the road. First, and most importantly, is vehicle insurance. If you plan to drive a rental or your own vehicle in Mexico, you’ll need special liability coverage issued by a Mexican insurance provider. It’s required by law and cannot be issued by your home carrier.

The cost varies but typically costs a few hundred U.S. dollars, depending on how long you’ll be traveling. We spent about five months meandering through the peninsula, lingering a week or two in each destination. The more time you have, the better. However, many travelers complete the route in two weeks.

Safety is a common concern when visiting Mexico. Many highways in Baja California are narrow, steep, poorly maintained, and lack guardrails. You’ll also want to keep an eye out for wandering livestock and unexpected obstacles along the way.

Cell phone service is sparse in this region, too. Make sure you have offline maps or directions to help you navigate—and never drive at night.

Section 1: U.S. border to Guerrero Negro

Cross the border into Mexico from San Diego. Tijuana is one of the world’s busiest land crossings, so I recommend using the Tecate or Otay crossings instead. Border agents will check your passport and vehicle registration before directing you to the immigration office to get your tourist permit, called an FMM.

From there, head about two hours south to Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico’s largest wine region and a paradise for food and wine lovers. Spend a day or two wine tasting and dining at Michelin-starred spots. Don’t miss a meal at La Cocina de Doña Esthela—a restaurant that Michelin says ""wins breakfast.""

After, continue south on Highway 1 toward Guerrero Negro. It’s a long, remote stretch that takes about nine hours to drive. Fill up on gas as often as you need, as there’s a particularly long gap (about 200 miles) with no gas stations near Cataviña.

Break up the drive into two days, staying in San Quintín. This town is revered for its fresh oysters that can be easily enjoyed at Restaurante Bar Jardines, just off the highway. In Cataviña, don’t miss the chance to stretch your legs among the giant cardón cacti and see ancient petroglyphs.

Section 2: Guerrero Negro to Mulegé

Guerrero Negro is a town known for two things: Salt and whales. Each winter, hundreds of gray whales migrate to Laguna Ojo de Liebre to give birth. From January to early April, you can take a guided boat tour to see these gentle giants.

(In this lagoon, the whales come to you)

Stay one night to experience the whales before driving four hours south to Mulegé, a palm-filled oasis with incredible beaches. This area is home to some of the most pristine shorelines in Mexico, with turquoise water, abundant sea life, and beachfront palapas perfect for camping.

If you’re short on time, this makes a great turnaround point to return north. But if you have more time, keep heading south into Baja California Sur—some of the best stops are still ahead.

Your next stop is two hours south in the charming Pueblo Mágico (a ""charming town"" classification by the Mexican government) of Loreto. Once the capital of the Baja California peninsula, Loreto offers rich history, a welcoming expat community, and a walkable downtown filled with great restaurants and bars.

It’s easy to spend a few days here, but don’t miss a boat tour through Loreto Bay National Park. This protected marine area includes five islands that host whales in the winter, along with migrating birds, endemic wildlife, and pristine beaches.

Section 4: Loreto to La Paz

La Paz is the capital of Baja California Sur and the state’s largest city, but still has a laid-back charm. Don’t miss Playa Balandra, often ranked among the world’s best beaches for its shallow turquoise waters and iconic mushroom-shaped rock.

There’s plenty to do in La Paz, but our favorite experience was swimming at Espíritu Santo Island, another stunning protected marine park. If you have extra time, head an hour southeast to La Ventana, a small beach town known for world-class windsurfing. If you time the tides right, you can even soak in beachfront hot springs.

Section 5: La Paz to Todos Santos and Cabo San Lucas

The final stretch of your Baja California road trip brings you to the southern tip of the peninsula—Todos Santos and Los Cabos. Start in Todos Santos, a Pueblo Mágico and one of the hottest destinations in Mexico. With incredible beaches, a thriving food scene, and boutique shops, it deserves at least a full day, if not more.

San José del Cabo is your gateway to Baja California’s major international airport and offers a mix of all-inclusive resorts and luxury stays. For a more remote beach escape, continue east to Cabo Pulmo National Park, home to one of North America’s healthiest coral reefs and excellent snorkeling, before making your way back toward the border.

In the UK’s dynamic wine scene, seasonally led vineyard restaurants are becoming as much of a draw as the wine itself, ideal for languid summer afternoons. Here are five of the best to whet your appetite — from Michelin-starred venues getting creative with locally foraged ingredients to an East Sussex hotspot where wood-wired pizzas are paired with the perfect natural wine.

1. Hambledon Vineyard, Hampshire

Operating since 1952, Hambledon is the UK’s oldest commercial winery. Its award-winning sparkling wines include the classic cuvee and, new for 2025, its first blanc de blancs. There’s a beautiful tasting room and the new restaurant is already a destination in its own right; overseen by head chef Nick Edgar, seasonal menus feature chalk stream trout with watercress, best end of lamb or Old Winchester cheese souffle.

2. Restaurant Interlude, West Sussex

Blending his South African heritage with classic European cooking, executive chef Jean Delport has helped Interlude, the elegant restaurant with rooms at the heart of the Leonardslee Estate, earn both a Michelin star and Michelin Green star. Foraged ingredients from the local landscape include wild garlic, bracken fiddleheads and hazelnuts, while the estate rears its own venison.

Sip and overlook the vines at this rooftop bistro-terrace above Chapel Down’s tasting room. Two AA Rosettes have been awarded for British-Mediterranean dishes, which are paired with feted wines from the 1,000-acre estate. Seasonality reigns and the menu might include Romney Marsh lamb with Moroccan mint yoghurt that sings when accompanied by a 2022 bacchus from Chapel Down’s Kit’s Coty North Downs vineyard. A glass of the rosé brut pairs well with the Kent rhubarb parfait.

4. Sandridge Barton, Devon

Founded in the 1980s, Sharpham Wine has recently shifted its focus to low-intervention wines. Set on the Sandridge Barton estate, the winery is home to rustic-chic tasting barns and a restaurant in the old milking parlour with a menu centered on Devon produce. Try the likes of estate beef fillet, red chicory and anchoiade, or a range of Sharpham cheeses, perfect with its medal-winning pinot noir.

While many cities can lay claim to being hubs of musical creativity, only a few become truly synonymous with a certain sound. After all, Vienna will always waltz to the tune of Strauss and few can imagine Seville without the passion of flamenco. In some cases, a city is its music. And, like that of a gifted composer, the European repertoire is vast. Whether for pop or classical, folk or techno, travellers will find no shortage of cities to immerse themselves in Europe’s great soundtrack. There are hands-on workshops, interactive museums that chart the story of a genre, and nightly shows at age-old venues — perhaps the closest thing to seeing a city’s soul. Whatever your taste, here are six of the best in which to plan a tuneful escape of your own.

1. Flamenco in Seville

Seville’s heart beats with flamenco. The stirring trinity of song, dance and music has its roots in the city’s Gitano communities and has become an emblem of both Seville and Spain; such is its cultural value that it was added to the UNESCO Intangible World Cultural Heritage list in 2010. Tablaos are the place to experience the dance. Packed each night of the week, these venues can range from the casual La Carbonería, where locals come for tapas and a show, to more venerable institutions such as Peña Flamenca Torres Macarena, a stage and cultural hub for new and established performers, or El Arenal, where punters can enjoy a full-course dinner with a show. But the street is perhaps the most authentic stage of all. An outdoor performance might stir into life on the grand Plaza de España; on a tree-shaded patio in the Barrio de Santa Cruz, or in Triana, the buzzy, working class district said to be the birthplace of flamenco. The area is home to the Teatro Flamenco, a bijou theatre that holds nightly performances, as well as the workshop of teacher and guide Eva Izquierdo, who runs hour-long flamenco classes for budding bailadores (dancers). For an edifying experience, the Museo del Baile Flamenco houses costumes, art and interactive exhibits, which chart the history of the genre, with shows in the courtyard or cellar events space.

2. Irish folk in Galway

The rousing sound of a fiddle is never far away on Ireland’s west coast. Huddled against the Atlantic, Galway is a bastion of traditional culture, where poets, artists and musicians have long found a place to hone their craft in the city’s bustling bars and salty-aired granite streets. More than just watering holes, Galway’s atmospheric pubs have a proud tradition of hosting and championing Irish folk (or Irish trad) musicians. The Crane Bar heads up any list of must-visit venues: both floors of this lively Victorian haunt host packed-out sessions each night of the week, while Monroe’s Tavern focuses on Irish-language music, and often throws dancing and poetry nights, too. With its charming web of streets festooned with flags and hanging baskets, the Latin Quarter is not to be missed. It’s the beating heart of the folk music scene: buskers can be heard on street corners, covering classic ballads or trying out their own original tunes, while the pubs here make a fine place to while away an evening with a whiskey or two. Tigh Neachtain has been trading since 1894 and has platformed several well-known Irish folk artists, including acclaimed accordionist Sharon Shannon.

4. Classical in Vienna

Just like the Danube, music flows through the heart of the Austrian capital. Some of history’s greatest virtuosos — from Mozart to Haydn, Beethoven to Strauss — lived and worked in Vienna, leaving a musical legacy that’s as rich as a Habsburg palace. When it comes to live music, the Vienna State Opera shines as one of the world’s most opulent music venues, while the Golden Hall at the Musikverein is home to the Vienna Mozart Orchestra. Mozart’s legacy lives on in performances at the Orangery at Schönbrunn Palace, the space where he premiered The Impresario in 1786. The House of Strauss, meanwhile, is the world’s only remaining concert hall where all four Strausses performed. Not everything takes place in palatial surrounds though. Intimate piano recitals are held at the Mozarthaus, where the composer lived, while the Annakirche is a baroque jewel of a church that hosts affordable concerts.

Date for the diary: 2025 is the bicentenary of Johann Strauss’s birth. A special concert by the Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony Orchestra and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter will mark the big day on 25 October.

5. Jazz in Paris

When American troops were stationed in Paris during the First World War, they brought with them the improvised rhythms of jazz. In the years that followed, this sound took Paris’s music halls by storm and has become entwined with the city’s soundscape. The French capital is peppered with old-school jazz clubs, and few are as hallowed as Le Caveau de la Huchette, on the Left Bank. The building dates to the 16th century and has staged countless stars of swing in its time, including Sidney Bechet and Lionel Hampton. On the Right Bank, life on the Rue des Lombards saunters to the sound of jazz, for it’s home to three of the city’s finest bars: crowds squeeze into the Duc des Lombards, Sunset/Sunside and Le Basier Salé for late-night jam sessions. But, if one figure epitomises the French jazz era, it’s Josephine Baker who turned heads in 1926 when she performed at the Folies Bergère wearing a banana skirt. The legendary music hall remains an art deco icon of Paris’s musical heritage.

6. Electronic in Berlin

If German reunification had a sound, it would be one of wavy synths and drum machines. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the underground electronic music scene offered West and East Berliners a way to come together. Since then, the city has become the pounding heart of European electronica. Venues have popped up in disused landmarks across the city, harking to the 1990s when students began squatting in abandoned buildings. A fine example is Tresor, which began in the cellar of a former department store in 1991. Now housed in a decommissioned power plant, its killer sound system draws fans from across the world. Kater Blau — a former soap factory — is a popular, open-air summer spot beside the River Spree, while ://about blank takes a political approach to techno, offering ‘hedonistic, insurrectionalist dialectic’. Top of any list, however, is Berghain, the cathedral-like club where (almost) anything goes. Top-quality sound and performances aside, the mysterious entry policy is all part of the appeal and has revellers queuing for hours.

A pretty place with a jumble of Moorish-style courtyards, gothic churches and grand baroque buildings, the small Andalucian city of Jerez is largely untouched by gentrification and tourism — despite being only an hour from Seville. Yet it has a long-held reputation as the country’s sherry capital: ‘jerez’ means ‘sherry’ in Spanish and the fortified wine has been made here for over 3,000 years.

Once considered old fashioned, sherry has stepped back into the spotlight in recent years, popping up in cocktails and spritzes in bars globally, and Jerez is the ideal place to rediscover it. Locals work hard to preserve their traditions — and have a good time, too — whether it’s at flamenco clubs, horse shows or lively sherry bars called tabancos. And with new direct flights from the UK launching this summer, the city is more accessible than ever.

Start your sherry education with Jerez native Aurora Muñoz, who runs Soleras y Criaderas. Her evening tours take travellers through the winding streets of the historic centre, stopping in different tabancos. As guests sample sherry and tapas, Aurora tells the story of the fortified wine, including how its production boomed in the 16th century after Sir Francis Drake stole 3,000 casks from neighbouring Cadiz and took them to England. The history of the tabancos themselves — originally drinking spots reserved for workers in the sherry-producing bodegas — is also explored.

Alongside traditional bars, Aurora stops at places putting a modern spin on the sherry drinking experience, such as bottle-shop-meets-deli Mantequeria El Espartero.

Las Banderillas

All ages gather at this traditional tabanco, where the walls are covered in bullfighting paraphernalia. Grandparents perch on high stools waiting for plates of Iberico ham to be passed back to them, toddlers are put on the bar and young couples grab glasses of fino — the driest sherry — to swig standing in the street. While normally tabancos serve simple cold snacks alongside the sherry, people come here for the full kitchen and excellent tapas — don’t miss the grilled octopus with garlicky potatoes.

C. Caballeros, 12, 11403 Jerez de la Frontera

Tabanco El Pasaje

At Jerez’s oldest tabanco — 100 this year — the sherry comes with a side of the city’s other most famous export, flamenco. Three times a day (around 2pm, 7.30pm and 9.30pm), a silence falls upon this normally riotous bar, one soon filled with the distinct sounds of this Andalucian art form — strumming guitars, energetic stomping and emotive singing. Book one of the limited tables for a front-row seat or join the standing crowd at the back — there’s a well-positioned mirror to enable those with an obstructed view to see.

Restaurante Pedro Nolasco

Best known for its famous Tio Pepe fino, the González Byass winery complex also houses this standout restaurant. Accessed via a private cobbled street enclosed by a canopy of vines, this minimalist ground-floor spot sits in an old wine cellar that opens up to a bright courtyard overlooking Jerez cathedral. Start with a refreshing fino spritz, made with dry sherry, sparkling water and elderflower. The dishes that follow are sherry-themed, such as sea bass with sherry vinegar, and melon infused with Tio Pepe, lime and honey. tiopepe.com

Bodegas Tradición

This small-scale independent sherry producer offers informative tours with a tasting. After seeing the sherry-making process and cellars up close, the bodega’s guide pulls up chairs in front of the barrels and serves up six key sherries. Taste from the driest (fino) to the sweetest (Pedro Ximénez), accompanied by an explanation of the processes that transform white grapes into these distinct flavours. The visit concludes with a tour of the owner’s private art collection, which includes works by Goya, Velázquez and El Greco.

Casablanca is well versed in transformation. Anfa, the Amazigh settlement that once stood here, was obliterated by the Portuguese in 1468. When they returned to rebuild the town half a century later, they renamed it ‘Casa Branca’ (White House). An earthquake then levelled the region in 1755, prompting Moroccan ruler Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah to build the whitewashed Medina. Earning itself the local name Dar al-Baida — literally ‘House of the White’ — it came to be known as Casablanca among the Spanish, who added touches of their own, including the 19th-century Church of San Buenaventura. Art nouveau and neo-Moorish buildings were then erected by the French, who established Casablanca as a business hub after their arrival in 1907. It went on to become a French protectorate in 1912 and remained so until 1956, with Assunna Mosque and Rue d’Agadir Market — futuristic constructions designed by Franco-Moroccan architect Jean-François Zevaco — marking a new era of independence.

Visitors now flock to the city to explore its varied architecture. Neo-Moorish buildings merging Islamic and art deco elements can be found around Boulevard Rachidi, with highlights including La Poste Centrale, the Palais de Justice and L’Église du Sacré Coeur, an ivory-white cathedral built in 1930. Further east, a few historic art deco establishments have been transformed in the city’s Petit Paris district, including Cinema Rialto, which offers a window into the city’s fabled cinematic history. Guided tours of many of these sites can be organised through Casamémoire, a non-profit that’s been working to preserve the city’s 20th-century architecture since 1995.

The Quartier Habbous is equally charming. Constructed predominantly between the 1920s and ’30s to accommodate an influx of Moroccan merchants, the southern district has an artisanal edge, with plenty of craft and leather stalls. Keep an eye out for the ornate wooden doorway leading to Pâtisserie Bennis Habous, which serves almond-filled kaab el ghazal (gazelle horns) and other delectable Moroccan pastries.

Young locals tend to gather on the clipped lawns of Arab League Park and Anfa Park. The latter is often used to host Casablanca’s annual summer music festivals: Jazzablanca and Alif Festival both draw in large crowds, while L’Boulevard, held at the nearby Stade RUC, is well known for hosting artists from Morocco’s blossoming rap scene. Contemporary dance styles are also a big draw; onlookers often gather along the palm-shaded steps of the Villa des Arts gallery to watch breakdancers from the local BIM Breaking association. Casablanca’s creative spirit seeps into its street art, too, with avant-garde designs depicting extraterrestrial life forms lining the Corniche promenade. Nevada Skatepark, one of the biggest in Africa, also has a number of bold pieces, including A Glitch In The Skatepark by local artist Abidwane.

A little quieter than those of Fez or Marrakech, the medina’s snaking, cobbled streets are full of vendors serving fresh fish sandwiches and syrup-coated sweets stuffed with dates. Plastic tables and chairs fill the larger squares, where visitors while away the hours sipping coffee from miniature glass cups. Dar DaDa, a courtyard restaurant, offers more substantial meals, including hearty chicken tagine. Typical Moroccan dishes are also available from Saveurs du Palais, an intimate restaurant further west in the Maârif district, where guests settle on low cushioned seating to enjoy chicken pastilla and slow-cooked lamb tagine. If you’d like to learn how to make Moroccan dishes yourself, Taste of Casablanca hosts a tour of the city’s markets, where you’ll roam in search of ingredients for your guided cookery class.

Three highlights

1. Hassan II Mosque

Opened in 1993, this mosque with a green minaret is one of the largest in Africa. Outside prayer hours, non-Muslims are able to admire the Moroccan craftsmanship on display. The pink granite comes from Agadir and the carved cedar wood from the Atlas Mountains.

2. Royal Mansour Casablanca Spa

You don’t have to have a room booked at Royal Mansour Casablanca to enjoy its spa. The hotel has its own traditional Moroccan hammam, a marble bathhouse where guests are scrubbed, washed and massaged into a state of bliss.

3. Cine-theatre Lutetia

First opened in 1953, Ciné-théâtre Lutetia hosted grand premieres and international film stars before falling into disrepair. Its original art deco features have since been restored, and it now runs an extensive programme of regional films.

It’s barely 9am when I slide into a bamboo armchair at Heming Tea House in Chengdu’s sprawling People’s Park. This century-old stalwart is one of the oldest teahouses in the megacity that I called home until I was nine. While I was growing up here, in one of China’s oldest tea-growing areas, many weekends were spent in an open-air teahouse like this one.

While adults played games of mahjong and the kids ran riot, roving hawkers carrying heavy baskets balanced on bamboo shoulder poles would come round selling snacks. The most famous of these is dan dan mian (shoulder pole noodles), where a nest of cold noodles is placed on a hot and tongue-numbing mala chilli oil base, topped with spring onion and minced meat, then mixed and greedily devoured.

But as I sip my grassy mao feng green tea, I’m struck by how unusually busy it is. Hordes of tourists with phones in video mode stream past the chairs crammed under teak pavilions and beige parasols. Most seats already filled by pensioners putting the world to rights or families cracking into toasted sunflower seeds.

A group of photography students is playing cards next to me, their backs turned on a pile of cameras carelessly stacked on a spare chair. I lean over and ask why there are so many people here on a weekday. One of the students looks up and tells me Heming has lately gained wang hong (‘internet fame’) with Chinese travellers — the local expression for going viral.

Later, I head to Lao Chuzi Sichuan Restaurant for a family gathering. The low-key restaurant and teahouse on the top floor of a four-storey office block isn’t particularly well known, but my uncle picked it because it’s a favourite in his neighbourhood, and it serves a stellar line-up of Sichuan dishes, including garlic-infused fish, fragrant aubergine and thin slices of poached pork served with a drizzle of sesame-laced chilli sauce.

I bring up the wang hong phenomenon. “There are wang hong places everywhere now and business is booming,” my uncle tells me, noting a similarly popular place down the road: 11th Street. Later, we stroll over to take a look. Amid the low-rise residential blocks is a row of a dozen or so two-storey buildings, their exposed wooden beams and pitched roofs incongruous with the more modern surroundings. Each houses a hole-in-the-wall joint; their names — like Xiangxiang Mian (‘alley noodles’) or Du Youyou Boboji (‘Du Youyou’s spicy skewers’) — advertise their specialities. Wooden tables and bamboo chairs spill onto the street in front, where there are as many people taking photos as there are noisily eating.

“These all used to be teahouses,” says my uncle, who’s lived in the neighbourhood for over 30 years and watched the buildings’ metamorphosis into buzzy restaurants. Before that, this ramshackle collective was made up of homes built during the tumultuous period after the Qing dynasty ended in 1912 and before the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949.

Since the 1990s, billions of pounds of investment have poured into Chengdu from the central government and private developers, triggering a building boom that’s given large swathes of the city a complete facelift. These buildings have somehow escaped the demolitions that razed their neighbours, and ironically their rundown appearance may now become their saving grace as people seek to hold on to the last vestiges of an old Chengdu.

Head chef, Steven Tan, stands proudly at Mi Xun Teahouse at The Temple House hotel. Before it was a Michelin-starred vegetarian restaurant, Mi Xun started with tea and snacks until more and more people requested the food.

In recent years, there’s been a concerted effort to protect and redevelop old buildings with heritage value — the type that don’t hold historical significance, like temples and monuments, but still have a place in the city’s history. One of the more sensitively done projects is the downtown Taikoo Li shopping and entertainment complex, where a handful of 19th-century homes surrounding Daci Temple were restored and given a new lease of life a decade ago. Mi Xun Teahouse, the Michelin-starred vegetarian restaurant at The Temple House hotel, occupies one of these. The grey brick walls of this single-storey building — set aside from the modern tower that makes up the main hotel — hide a tranquil courtyard that transforms into a wood-panelled al fresco dining spot in fine weather, a single tree providing dappled shade. It’s here that I meet executive chef Tony Xu, who tells me that in the beginning Mi Xun was just supposed to be a teahouse.

“Because Chengdu is very big on tea, we started with tea and some snacks,” he says, explaining that teahouses almost always serve some kind of food. “But more and more people were requesting our food, so we added more dishes to the menu. And now people mainly come for the food.”

Tony takes inspiration from Buddhist culinary traditions in a nod to the temple next door, and so the menu is vegetarian with a very subtle use of spices and no garlic or onion. He is also an innovator, preparing dishes such as a vegan dan dan mian, made with an egg-free noodle of his own creation, containing wheat and cake flour for extra bite and spinach juice for colour; and mapo tofu, which is flavoured with mushrooms instead of the traditional pork mince. The result is a modern take on classic Sichuan flavours, with striking visual appeal.

For the tea connoisseur, Mi Xun also offers a selection of premium brews such as da hong pao from Fujian province, and Pu’er from Yunnan, served in a pared-down version of the traditional gongfu tea-preparation ritual. Instead of an elaborate ceremony where a tea master washes the leaves, warms the tiny cups and prepares the tea, some of these stages are done behind the scenes. All the guests need do is steep the tea according to their preference. Attention is still paid to the drinkware — green tea always served in a glass pot, for example, while red tea comes in white ceramic. “We’ve simplified things so everyone can enjoy the experience and take joy from tasting tea,” says teahouse manager Yvonne Du.

Tea is cheap and widely available in Chengdu — meaning it’s enjoyed by a wide cross-section of society. “You’ll find teahouses all over China,” explains Susan Yin, a guide at food tour company Lost Plate. “In Chengdu, tea is for everyone. It doesn’t matter what your background is, or whether you’re rich or poor.”

Yin is my guide for a food tour just east of the downtown area. The company’s co-founder, Ruixi Hu, lives in Chengdu and designed the itinerary around some of her favourite haunts. As part of the tour, we hop into a cramped tuk-tuk that whizzes us around the neighbourhood. At one stop, we try dan hong gao, fluffy pancakes stuffed with a mix of sesame, crushed peanuts and sugar. At another, we tuck into enormous bowls of freshly made pork wontons, some in plain broth and some swimming in fragrant chilli oil. We also stop at casual noodle shop Tang Dan Dan Tian Shui Mian, visited by the late US chef Anthony Bourdain for his CNN show Parts Unknown, and slurp through bowls of tian shui mian (‘sweet water noodles’) — a thick, springy, hand-cut variety that comes slicked in a sweet, peanut and sesame paste sauce.

It’s only when we sit down at a restaurant serving jiang hu cuisine — a rough-and-ready style of cooking that has its origins in the street markets of Sichuan, a province that’s big on flavour intensity — that Yin and I finally get some time to chat.

As we liberate chunks of dry-fried chicken from underneath piles of chillies, and fish out tender slivers of beef from a spicy broth, Yin tells me she settled in Chengdu over a decade ago for two very simple reasons: the food and the lifestyle. Taking a sip of buckwheat tea, she adds: “Chengdu is a laid-back city, and the best way to experience this is in a teahouse.”

https://www.theverge.com/policy/685599/fcc-commissioner-democrat-anna-gomez-trump-carr-first-amendment-tour,"Every morning, Federal Communications Commissioner Anna Gomez says she checks her email “to see if I’m going into work.”

The idea that Gomez could wake up one day to an email dismissing her is not unfounded. That’s essentially how the two Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, another agency of the federal government that was created to be independent, found out that Trump was firing them — even though doing so without cause breached decades-old Supreme Court precedent.

Now that it’s only Gomez and Carr left at the commission, since Democrat Geoffrey Starks and Republican Nathan Simington both stepped down last week, the agency no longer has a quorum to vote on significant actions. Only three members of the five-person committee can be from the same party, and while Trump has one Republican nominee awaiting confirmation and a second rumored, Gomez isn’t confident that Trump will eventually move to nominate another Democrat. “I have not seen him nominate a single Democrat to the entire administration,” she tells The Verge in a brief interview after an event with the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in Washington, DC. “I have only seen him fire them.”

One might assume that Gomez’s nationwide tour critiquing the agency chair’s actions would make for a tense office environment back at the FCC. But, she says, she actually has a “good working relationship” with Carr. “It just is what it is,” she says. “He knows that I need to speak out, and we have a relationship where I can tell him my concerns also.” Does she have any sense of why Trump hasn’t attempted to fire her? “No,” Gomez says.

“I have not seen him nominate a single Democrat to the entire administration. I have only seen him fire them”

But the loss of a quorum at the FCC could set up more points of opposition until a third commissioner is confirmed by the Senate. FCC bureaus are allowed to carry out some work themselves on what’s called delegated authority, but are not supposed to deal with novel issues meant to be handled at the commission level. Those are the kinds of things Gomez thinks should wait for a quorum so the FCC can vote on them, leading to a final decision that — unlike bureau-level actions — is reviewable in court. Gomez has already critiqued the bureau-level approval of Verizon’s $20 billion Frontier acquisition as a “backroom” deal, and warns that the review of Paramount’s proposed Skydance deal should not be handled in the same way.

During the CTA event, Gomez gave a tentative response to whether the FCC had adequate guardrails to fend off conflicts of interest with Musk’s companies, like SpaceX, which operates the Starlink satellite internet network, that can benefit from certain agency policy. Until recently, Musk had a cozy relationship with Trump, and his involvement with DOGE raised questions about the kinds of information he could access that related to his financial interests (the White House insisted Musk would step back from any potential conflicts). “I can only imagine our general counsel would be very involved in making those decisions,” Gomez says. “As a commissioner, I don’t have perfect insight into those types of activities, but our chairman is the former general counsel of the agency and is fully aware of those obligations.”

Despite the tenuous position she’s in, Gomez says she’s been encouraged during her First Amendment tour to see support from people of different ideological backgrounds. “This is not a red or a blue issue. This is an issue of right or wrong. This is an issue of protecting our democracy and the First Amendment,” she says. “I think it’s important that we speak up and push back, because we can’t let this become the status quo.”",World

For several months, my Slack avatar was a screenshot of my incredibly cursed Vision Pro persona. My virtual avatar’s head was cocked back, cackling into the pixelated void, her hair one solid unmoving block. It wasn’t good — but it also wasn’t the end of the world. Everyone else’s Persona looked just as horrible, and honestly, it was funny. So I was skeptical when, at the WWDC keynote, Apple announced that visionOS 26 had improved the system’s floating avatars.

And then I got to make one.

The process to make Personas hasn’t changed, but the end result is vastly improved. (Full disclosure: The video you see above was recorded by Apple and provided to me after my demo.) It doesn’t completely erase the uncanniness — the bottom half of your face is still more expressive than the top, it got my nose a bit weird in certain angles, and some microexpressions feel stiff. But hair looks more like hair now. You can see eyelashes and skin texture. It was even able to capture my nose contour makeup.

Side profiles have also been improved — something I noticed in a FaceTime with our old weekend editor Wes Davis, a fellow Vision Pro owner who also downloaded the visionOS 26 beta. Previously, if you turned your head to the side, you could look flattened, something akin to a PlayStation 2 era, non-cut scene video game character.

It’s easier to tweak your Persona now, too. You can customize lighting, skin tone, and get granular with eyewear if you’re a glasses wearer.

Wes’s side profile is much better, though the mustache can still be… odd in motion. Screenshot: The Verge

The biggest thing for me, though, is when I laugh and my eyes scrunch up, I no longer look like a caricature of myself. After spending a few weeks experimenting with AI image and video generation, I’ve been subjected to numerous demoralizing renders of my monolids. You might not know this if you’re not Asian, but monolids aren’t considered a desirable feature under traditional Western and Eastern beauty standards alike. I’ll acknowledge that the fact they’re often terribly rendered is a first-world problem. Nevertheless, it can be hurtful when blepharoplasties to reshape eyelids are an incredibly common procedure in my community. It might seem like a trivial thing to fixate on, but if the future is really meant to be lived inside headsets — I want my virtual self to actually look like me.

In my brief hands-on, I also got the impression that Personas in visionOS 26 are also much better at capturing a variety of expressions. I know that the average person isn’t going to be winking, making goofy faces, or purposefully contorting their face as if they were a Disney cartoon. But, if you are that type of person, I can say I was impressed at how much better the new Persona system is at handling my facial gymnastics. (Alas, Wes’ new Persona still has an unflappably weird mustache.)

But enough of my yammering, you can judge for yourself in the video above, compared to screenshots of my old Persona I’ve included below.

https://www.theverge.com/bmw/684404/bmw-ix3-ev-prototype-neue-klasse-first-drive,"There’s a fight for control going on inside the cockpits of many modern cars. Enable all the active safety systems in a Tesla, and it’ll do most of the steering for you. But if it makes an errant turn or meanders a little too far this way or that in the lane (and trust me, it will), you’re left wrestling the wheel out of Autopilot’s virtual hands.

Assistance systems from other manufacturers do better at ceding control whenever you feel like taking over, but BMW is about to take that to a new level with the first car built on its upcoming Neue Klasse platform. It includes an advanced driver assist system that the company says is a proper symbiosis, where the car’s sensors and systems don’t fight with or yell at you but instead work with you to make driving safer and less stressful.

I sampled this suite in a prototype of BMW’s iX3, the first electric SUV on the Neue Klasse platform, designed from the ground up to offer more range, better handling, and way more smarts. BMW is promising 400 miles of range from a new battery architecture that can charge at up to 400 kW. That means adding something like 200 miles of range in 10 minutes, but there’s a lot more to it than that.

Better brains

At the core of the iX3’s safety system is a computing platform that BMW calls a “superbrain.” That’s an evocative term for a Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride chip, but it does offer far more power than anything the company has put on the road before. That’s paired with a more advanced sensor suite, with better cameras and higher-fidelity radar sensors, all combined to give a better view of the world around.

One of those key sensors is the driver monitoring suite, which can detect where you’re looking and whether you’re paying attention while behind the wheel. Plenty of cars offer some degree of monitoring like this, usually nagging you with beeping and blinking unpleasantries when your eyes linger on a roadside distraction for too long. The iX3 goes beyond that by using eye-tracking technology to not just complain, but actually improve your experience.

If you’re driving down the highway and BMW’s highway assistant is active, it’ll steer itself and even change lanes. In some current BMWs, you can just look in the mirror to initiate a lane change. The iX3 takes that a step further by proactively putting on the turn signal for you should you take the wheel and change lanes yourself.

Yes, finally, a BMW designed to tackle the most common preconception about BMW drivers: they never signal before changing lanes.

Try to change lanes manually without checking the blind spot, the lane-keep assistance system will resist the change and try to keep you where you are. But, if you’ve looked first, the car won’t resist your control at all, as you’ve proved to it that you’re doing your part.

The car will detect your attention in other ways, too. I had a chance to drive next to a dummy pedestrian standing partially in my lane. Without any input from me, the car came smoothly to a stop. But, when I tried again, steering slightly to the left and showing that I was paying attention, the car allowed me to move out of the lane without resistance.

Smooth driving, smoother stopping

I also got a chance to sample the other brain inside the new iX3, which the company has unfortunately labeled “Heart of Joy.” This in-house developed processor aggregates all the traction, stability, and electric motor management functions that are typically handled by a dozen different processors sourced from a dozen different suppliers and scattered throughout the car.

Unifying all that has some significant implications. The car can more quickly and seamlessly manage power to the dual motors that give it 400 horsepower and all-wheel drive, so when I was sliding the camouflaged prototype around a wet test track, it felt like the stability and traction control systems were working to help me, rather than just trying desperately to slow me down.

But when it was time to pause the action, something almost magical happened. On a test track, I was told to close my eyes and let the iX3 bring itself to a stop. That process of deceleration was so smooth that I genuinely couldn’t tell when the wheels had stopped rolling. The new systems controlling those electric motors allow more precise application of the regenerative braking function. That not only means smoother one-pedal driving, but the kind of perfectly controlled stop that’ll keep your passengers from getting jostled at every red light.

An irresistible EV?

Ultra-smooth stopping is a small thing, but it really does increase the comfort of driving around in the iX3. By the end of the day, I was blown away by everything BMW’s new EV brings to the table. And that’s on top of the big, dashboard-spanning Panoramic Vision display, which runs from one pillar to another to provide a customizable and interactive information display.

The big question, though, is whether any of this will be enough to convince the largely EV-skeptical luxury car buyers out there that all this is good enough to finally make the switch away from internal combustion. The company’s gas-powered X3 is consistently one of its top sellers, and while that isn’t going away, BMW clearly has high hopes that the iX3 will bring that kind of sales success to its battery-powered efforts.",Automobile

https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/684924/congress-big-beautiful-bill-state-ai-law-ban-pushback,"is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

“This is absurd.”

That’s all Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, recalls thinking when she first heard about the proposed moratorium on state AI regulation tucked into President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” — the same funding bill that had Trump and Elon Musk recently trading barbs online. According to the bill’s text, no state “may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems” for a 10-year period, which would start the same day the bill is passed.

The moratorium was worse than doing nothing at all to regulate AI, she remembers thinking. Not only was the proposed rule stopping such regulation in the future, but it was also “rolling back the very few protections we have.” It could scuttle bills covering anything from data privacy to facial recognition models in Washington, Colorado, and other states.

“It’s turning the clock back, and it’s freezing it there,” Kak says. Days after she learned about the moratorium, she was called to testify about it at the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The AI moratorium passed without issue as part of the House bill, and it’s been preserved in the current Senate version with a few changes. But for weeks, it’s been making waves among Democrats and Republicans alike, and every day brings new developments and draws new battle lines. That’s true not just in Washington, but also for the AI industry and its critics — who are working out what the rule could mean for business and society at large.

The basic contours of the debate are simple. Many Republicans and tech leaders — including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — think the moratorium will cut through patchwork state AI regulations that could hamper US companies competing against rivals like China’s DeepSeek. Many Democrats and AI researchers, on the other hand, believe it will kneecap a broad range of tech regulation as states wait for federal action and pave the way for AI systems even less controllable than the ones we have today. Within those factions, things are a little more complicated.

To Jutta Williams, who has worked in regulatory compliance and responsible AI at tech companies like Google, Reddit, X, and Meta, a “patchwork quilt” of regulation “just confuses the issues and makes it impossible to do anything.” Now an advisor to startups focused on social good, Williams says she has spent 25 years working on compliance in all types of industries, mostly in the data governance space, which is similar to AI in many ways. When regulation is done “in a fragmented sort of way,” she says, “the net net is a lot of cost, a lot of internal friction, a lot of confusion, and no progress.”

Williams says that although the federal government “has not done their job in managing interstate issues,” states should be focused on societal components and the things they can control instead of regulating AI businesses.

OpenAI lobbied publicly for a moratorium on state laws citing SB 1047, a California AI safety bill narrowly vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year. Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have stayed largely quiet and did not respond to requests for comment. Perplexity AI spokesperson Jesse Dwyer offered a relatively neutral statement with a stray shot at the hybrid nonprofit/for-profit OpenAI. “Some model builders have already shown us they’re going to do whatever they want, regardless of regulation—policies governing non-profits for instance—whereas we’re confident our commitment to accurate and trustworthy AI positions us well in any regulatory environment,” Dwyer told The Verge. And Josh Gartner, head of comms for Cohere, told The Verge that “the most effective way to promote the healthy and safe development of AI is a federal standard that provides a consistent and predictable regulatory framework.”

There’s one example of high-profile opposition. On June 5th, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei published an op-ed in The New York Times arguing that while he understood the motivations behind the proposed moratorium, it’s “far too blunt an instrument. A.I. is advancing too head-spinningly fast.”

Amodei called for a federal transparency standard instead, mandating that leading AI companies be required “to publicly disclose on their company websites … how they plan to test for and mitigate national security and other catastrophic risks. They would also have to be upfront about the steps they took, in light of test results, to make sure their models were safe before releasing them to the public.”

“I believe that these systems could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off,” Amodei wrote. “Without a clear plan for a federal response, a moratorium would give us the worst of both worlds — no ability for states to act, and no national policy as a backstop.”

For Kak, Amodei’s op-ed was important. It was a welcome change to see an industry player stick their neck out and acknowledge the need for any kind of regulation. But, she says, “We have no such federal standard, and the last 10 years do not inspire confidence that any [such] standards are coming.”

“In this debate, we’re going to hear a lot, especially from industry players, around punting the question of regulation to the federal level,” Kak says, adding, “It can’t be industry players acting as the messiahs of dictating that regulatory agenda because there’s a clear conflict of interest. That needs to come from industry-independent, public perspectives.”

As for the popular argument that state-level AI regulation will hurt AI startups, Kak says that’s a “smokescreen.”

While some proponents of the moratorium have floated a claim that there are about 1,000 state laws regulating AI, that’s not the case. Although more than 1,000 pieces of AI-related legislation were introduced so far in 2025, just over 75 have been adopted or enacted, according to Chelsea Canada of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In 2024, out of 500 proposed AI bills, just 84 pieces of legislation were enacted and 12 resolutions or memorials were adopted.

What we have now, Kak says, is “very far from a patchwork of U.S. regulation — it’s a straightforward laundry list of targeted rules that get at the worst actors in the market.”

Another key concern, according to Kyle Morse, deputy executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, is that the provision bans a broad range of laws and may prohibit state-level regulation on any sort of “automated decision system.”

“It would apply to not just AI-specific laws — it would apply to state-level consumer protection laws,” Morse said. “We’re talking about civil rights laws. We’re talking about so much more than just AI companies’ abilities to do their jobs.”

So many businesses are now billing themselves as operating AI services, Morse said, that it’s possible that under the moratorium, “companies in healthcare or housing can claim to be AI companies [to get out of regulation], where AI is integrated into their business but it’s not their core business model.”

The rule’s fate in the Senate seems uncertain. On Tuesday, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-MA), a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, announced he plans to file an amendment to the bill that would block the moratorium.

“Despite the overwhelming opposition to their plan to block states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade, Republicans are refusing to back down on this irresponsible and short-sighted provision,” he said in a statement.

And last Tuesday, he delivered remarks on the Senate floor calling the provision a “backdoor AI moratorium” that “is not serious, it’s not responsible, and it’s not acceptable.”

“They are choosing Big Tech over kids, families, seniors, and disadvantaged communities across this country,” Markey said. “We cannot allow that to happen. I am committed to fighting this 10-year ban with every tool at my disposal.” That same day, a bipartisan group of 260 state lawmakers from all 50 states wrote a letter to Congress calling for the opposition to the moratorium. Last Wednesday, Americans for Responsible Innovation and a group of policy and advocacy nonprofits announced a campaign to mobilize voters against the moratorium, which gathered 25,000 petitions opposing the provision in two weeks, according to ARI.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) publicly opposed the bill due to the moratorium after voting in its favor, and some GOP senators have said they plan to vote against its current text.

On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee proposed alternative language for the moratorium, moving from a blanket ban on state AI regulation to a warning that states must not regulate AI if they want to receive federal broadband funding.

If the Senate does make changes to the bill’s language, the House will need to vote on it again. Proponents would also need to overcome the Byrd Rule, which disallows non-budgetary clauses from being included in fiscal-focused bills. For those trying to pass the bill, Kak said, “the emphasis right now is on finding a way to have a sweeping rollback on state legislation survive the Byrd Rule, given that on the face of it, this proposal would never survive.”

The moratorium, if passed, puts regulating the AI industry at large — a sector that’s predicted to surpass $1 trillion in revenue in less than seven years — squarely in the hands of a Congress that has railed against Big Tech but failed to pass everything from a digital privacy framework to an antitrust overhaul.

“If past is prologue,” Morse said, “Congress has struggled to get meaningful safeguards and protections over the finish line, and a moratorium isn’t the way to do that.”",Technology

https://www.theverge.com/smart-home-review/681701/current-model-p-smart-pizza-oven-review,"I am an excellent home cook, if I do say so myself. I regularly produce restaurant-quality dishes from my smart kitchen. But I have two favorite dishes I’ve never mastered at home: pizza and burgers. Yes, I can make them, but do they taste as good as my local burger or pizza joint? Nope. Naturally, I was intrigued when I heard about the new smart pizza oven from Current, which launched at CES earlier this year.

Yes, I know pizza ovens have been a thing for a while with their enticing promise of making pizzeria-quality pizza at home. But they’re eye-wateringly expensive, and I’ve always been put off by the prospect of putting a wood or gas-burning appliance in my backyard for the sole purpose of making pizza. Current’s Model P Smart Pizza Oven is electric, so there’s no need to mess with fuel, plus it can be used outdoors and inside (in theory — but my initial attempts produced far too much smoke for indoor use to be viable).

Easy to read display with a proper knob The Bad Takes a while to preheat

Large and hefty

Pizza peel sold separately

Too smoky to use indoors

Cleaning the stone is tricky $559 at Current How we rate and review products

The Model P costs $699, which is a lot, but significantly less than other options; the electric version of the popular Ooni oven is $899 without any connected features. Current is a startup based in Columbus, Georgia, that’s trying to electrify outdoor cooking (its first product was a smart electric outdoor grill). Its smart pizza oven is one of the first to feature an app for controlling the oven, with the choice of a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. The app has several tools that promise to help me make the perfect pizza. Challenge accepted.

The Model P can reach a blistering 850 degrees Fahrenheit. It cycles power between graphite tubes at the top and standard calrod heating elements on the bottom, and it uses proprietary algorithms to cook three different styles: Neapolitan, New York, and thin crust. There’s also a frozen pizza setting and a broil function, which you can use for any food that could benefit from a broil (such as searing a steak or browning some veggies), giving you a bit more functionality.

It comes with a 12-inch cordierite cooking stone, but you have to buy the pizza peel separately, which is required to pop the dough into the oven without burning your fingers. Current sent me a wooden one, which it says will be available soon; there’s a $89 steel version that you can buy bundled with the oven and a pizza cutter for $847.

The Current pizza oven is compact and easy to use. It can be used indoors or outdoors. However, its exterior gets very hot, so you need to position it away from walls or anything flammable.

The Current Backyard app (iOS and Android) allows for mobile control of the oven, sends notifications for preheating and cooking timers, and has a pizza build calculator that adjusts the cooking time based on how thin your crust is and how high you pile your pizza.

Making pizza is an art, and it’s not one I am close to having mastered, even with all this tech

As the pizza cooks in around two minutes, the alerts for preheating (which takes a while) and the pizza calculator were the most useful, as my past attempts at homemade pizzas often resulted in soggy toppings and undercooked crusts.

To put the Model P through its paces, I invited a few friends over for a pizza party and set it up on a wooden table on my porch, a few inches away from a brick wall. You have to consider placement carefully because it gets very hot. It’s elevated by four metal legs, so it’s safe to use on most surfaces. (There’s an outdoor pizza cart available for $499 if you want something more tailored.)

Current recommends making your own pizza dough, and there’s a recipe in the app you can follow. Current also recommends store-bought dough from Trader Joe’s and Publix; I went for the easy option.

I set up an indoor pizza-making station, with a large wooden cutting board, lots of flour, several portions of Trader Joe’s pizza dough and premade pizza sauce, and some standard toppings: mozzarella, pepperoni, olives, and basil. We then proceeded to go crazy twirling dough and topping pizzas.

Prepping the dough and preheating the oven is the most time-intensive step. Photo: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge The oven can cook a Neopolitan-style pizza in as little as 2 minutes.

Our first few pizzas were a bit of a disaster. We made a plain mozzarella pizza on New York-style (635F) and followed the suggested six minutes of oven time, but it came out overcooked. The next attempt had too many toppings, and the dough got stuck to the pizza peel mid-flick, launching cheese and pepperoni onto the molten stone, resulting in a smoky mess.

I did like the option to make concurrent pizzas with a button press — no need to start the preheat over. And not having to rotate the pizza, combined with getting alerts on my phone when the pie was ready, meant I didn’t have to hover over it.

But by our third pizza, the stone had a thick layer of burnt cheese on it, so I had to stop the party and go back to the cutting board.

Obligatory pizza glamor shot.

I realized I had been too eager, assuming the oven would magically deliver perfect pizzas. It turns out that there was quite a bit more prep I needed to do, the most important being buying a bag of semolina flour. Apparently, this is a magic pizza-making ingredient.

I went back to Current for more tips — especially about cleaning the stone, which needs to be done carefully. It can’t be soaked or scrubbed with anything more abrasive than a nylon brush. I bought some new dough and followed Current’s detailed YouTube video on how to properly roll it out (sadly, no twirling required). I then fired up the app to use the neat pizza builder tool that customizes the cook time based on style, dough type, and thickness, as well as how much sauce, cheese, and toppings you have.

Armed with semolina and a tad more patience, my next attempt was with the Neapolitan style, which yields a crispier pizza and uses the oven’s top temperature of 850F to get those signature burnt leopard spots. This is the type of pizza you eat at a sidewalk cafe in Italy. The downside was that it took a while to heat up, but the pizza only took two minutes to cook.

1 / 2 Our first attempt at cheesy bread, New York-style pizza.

I was more successful, producing an almost perfect Neapolitan-style buffalo mozzarella and pepperoni pizza with a delightfully puffy (if slightly misshapen) crust. There was still a fair amount of smoke, though, and my husband (who’s a firefighter) is still not keen on me using the oven indoors.

My only other complaint is that the cheese wasn’t hot all the way through; next time, I’ll opt for thinner slices. I then popped in a more traditional shredded mozzarella pizza for my daughter, going with New York-style as she likes the softer crust. After two bites, she declared it was as good as her favorite cheese pizza from Pisanos, our favorite local spot.

The Model P comes in two colors, sand or slate.

Hardware-wise, the oven’s sleek, domed design and glass door would look great on a kitchen counter — if you have the space. At just over 40 pounds, it’s not that portable, but it feels solid and well built. The on-device controls include a large LCD display with touch controls for turning the power on and off and setting a timer. This is paired with a physical dial to adjust time and temperature and select different pizza styles.

I would like to see a physical on / off button, as I worry about the longevity of a touchscreen on a device that can be used outdoors. (It isn’t waterproof, so you shouldn’t leave it uncovered.)

But, as with most high-heat smart appliances, you have to confirm on the device to turn it on for obvious safety reasons.

Making pizza is an art that I’m far from mastering, even with the Model P’s advanced tech.

https://www.theverge.com/smart-home-review/681701/current-model-p-smart-pizza-oven-review#comments,"I am an excellent home cook, if I do say so myself. I regularly produce restaurant-quality dishes from my smart kitchen. But I have two favorite dishes I’ve never mastered at home: pizza and burgers. Yes, I can make them, but do they taste as good as my local burger or pizza joint? Nope. Naturally, I was intrigued when I heard about the new smart pizza oven from Current, which launched at CES earlier this year.

Yes, I know pizza ovens have been a thing for a while with their enticing promise of making pizzeria-quality pizza at home. But they’re eye-wateringly expensive, and I’ve always been put off by the prospect of putting a wood or gas-burning appliance in my backyard for the sole purpose of making pizza. Current’s Model P Smart Pizza Oven is electric, so there’s no need to mess with fuel, plus it can be used outdoors and inside (in theory — but my initial attempts produced far too much smoke for indoor use to be viable).

Cleaning the stone is tricky $559 at Current How we rate and review products

The Model P costs $699, which is a lot, but significantly less than other options; the electric version of the popular Ooni oven is $899 without any connected features. Current is a startup based in Columbus, Georgia, that’s trying to electrify outdoor cooking (its first product was a smart electric outdoor grill). Its smart pizza oven is one of the first to feature an app for controlling the oven, with the choice of a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. The app has several tools that promise to help me make the perfect pizza. Challenge accepted.

The Model P can reach a blistering 850 degrees Fahrenheit. It cycles power between graphite tubes at the top and standard calrod heating elements on the bottom, and it uses proprietary algorithms to cook three different styles: Neapolitan, New York, and thin crust. There’s also a frozen pizza setting and a broil function, which you can use for any food that could benefit from a broil (such as searing a steak or browning some veggies), giving you a bit more functionality.

It comes with a 12-inch cordierite cooking stone, but you have to buy the pizza peel separately, which is required to pop the dough into the oven without burning your fingers. Current sent me a wooden one, which it says will be available soon; there’s a $89 steel version that you can buy bundled with the oven and a pizza cutter for $847.

The Current pizza oven is compact and easy to use. It can be used indoors or outdoors. However, its exterior gets very hot, so you need to position it away from walls or anything flammable.

The Current Backyard app (iOS and Android) allows for mobile control of the oven, sends notifications for preheating and cooking timers, and has a pizza build calculator that adjusts the cooking time based on how thin your crust is and how high you pile your pizza.

Making pizza is an art, and it’s not one I am close to having mastered, even with all this tech

As the pizza cooks in around two minutes, the alerts for preheating (which takes a while) and the pizza calculator were the most useful, as my past attempts at homemade pizzas often resulted in soggy toppings and undercooked crusts.

To put the Model P through its paces, I invited a few friends over for a pizza party and set it up on a wooden table on my porch, a few inches away from a brick wall. You have to consider placement carefully because it gets very hot. It’s elevated by four metal legs, so it’s safe to use on most surfaces. (There’s an outdoor pizza cart available for $499 if you want something more tailored.)

Current recommends making your own pizza dough, and there’s a recipe in the app you can follow. Current also recommends store-bought dough from Trader Joe’s and Publix; I went for the easy option.

I set up an indoor pizza-making station, with a large wooden cutting board, lots of flour, several portions of Trader Joe’s pizza dough and premade pizza sauce, and some standard toppings: mozzarella, pepperoni, olives, and basil. We then proceeded to go crazy twirling dough and topping pizzas.

https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record,"is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.

Nintendo was expecting the Switch 2 would be just as successful as the original, and it’s already become the fastest-selling game console of all time after a strong launch. Nintendo revealed today that it has sold more than 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the console’s first four days, surpassing records for any of Nintendo’s hardware within the same launch period. But the record is more significant than that.

Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, points out on X that the Switch 2 is “the fastest selling home video game console of all time.” It took Sony 16 days to sell 2.1 million PS4 consoles, and six weeks to reach 4.2 million units. The Switch 2 has also comfortably beaten the PS5 launch, which debuted during the pandemic and associated chip supply constraints. It took seven weeks for Sony to sell-through 4.4 million PS5 units.

It’s clear that Nintendo was able to meet pent-up demand for a Switch successor by having ample inventory on hand in key markets. Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, but there was still some limited stock on launch day for those willing to line up at midnight or take a chance in the morning. The threat of price increases from tariffs likely helped goose initial demand, too.

While the Switch 2 isn’t the biggest UK console launch of all time and it seemed relatively easy for Brits to buy one on launch day, it’s still the fourth best-selling console in the UK according to data from NielsenIQ.

Analysts had widely predicted strong Switch 2 launch sales, despite a lack of launch titles for Nintendo’s latest console. Nintendo’s record-breaking Switch 2 sales are thanks to a lot of pent-up demand waiting on this new hardware, and Nintendo using that time to build enough units to meet demand.

The real question now is whether Nintendo can keep up this sales pace, and if tariffs and handheld alternatives could slow down sales. Nintendo is aiming to hit its goal of 15 million Switch 2 console sales by the end of March 2026, and it’s already off to a good start with 3.5 million in four days.

The original Switch launched in March 2017 and sold 17.79 million units in its first 13 months on sale — more than Nintendo’s own estimates at the time. The Switch has now sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, pushing it close to overtaking the DS as Nintendo’s best-selling console.",Technology

The hotline is now open for users to provide feedback to an interactive AI version of Siemiatkowski that’s trained on his “real voice, insights, and experiences,” according to a press release.

“Customers, including consumers and merchants alike, can speak to it about product features, issues and suggestions for improvements,” Klarna says. “‘AI Sebastian’ can also answer questions about Klarna’s vision and mission, and speak about its founding story and journey so far, based on learnings from ‘real life Sebastian.’”

After the hotline takes a call, a transcript and summary are generated that are “automatically analyzed by a large language model (LLM), populating an internal live feed and innovation dashboard.” Klarna says its product and engineering teams will then review the “actionable insights immediately” and assign “priority tasks.” The company claims that issues raised today could “translate into tangible product improvements already the following day.”

Following a ruling on April 30th by the Epic Games v. Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, Apple can no longer collect a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how developers can direct users to alternate payment options. Apple has appealed the decision, but is also complying with it in the interim, prompting several companies to announce app updates making it easier for users to pay for subscriptions and services. That now includes Amazon’s iOS Kindle app. Contrary to prior limitations, there is now a prominent orange “Get book” button on Kindle app’s book listings.

“We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Gillman told The Verge over email. “By selecting ‘Get Book’ within the Kindle for iOS app, customers can now complete their purchase through their mobile web browser.”

Amazon wasn’t the first company to release a dedicated reading device with an E Ink screen. Companies like Sony beat them to the punch by a couple of years. What helped make the Kindle popular, and arguably destined to dominate the e-reader market, was that you could buy books right on the device, even if you didn’t have Wi-Fi access thanks to Amazon’s now discontinued cellular Whispernet service.

Before today’s updates, buying books wasn’t a feature you’d find in the Kindle mobile app following app store rule changes Apple implemented in 2011 that required developers to remove links or buttons leading to alternate ways to make purchases. You could search for books that offered samples for download, add them to a shopping list, and read titles you already own, but you couldn’t actually buy titles through the Kindle or Amazon app, or even see their prices.

To avoid having to pay Apple’s 30 percent cut of in-app purchases, and the 27 percent tax on alternative payment methods Apple introduced in January 2024, Amazon previously required you to visit and login to its online store through a device’s web browser to purchase ebooks on your iPhone or iPad, which were then synchronized to the app. It was a cumbersome process compared to the streamlined experience of buying ebooks directly on a Kindle e-reader.

Amazon probably isn’t going to change its mind about avoiding Apple’s 30 percent cut on ebook sales, but the update to the Kindle app now makes it much easier to purchase ebooks on your iPhone for those times when your Kindle e-reader doesn’t have a reliable Wi-Fi connection.

However, there’s still the chance Apple could win its appeal, forcing Amazon to undo these updates and improvements and once again make buying ebooks on iPhones overcomplicated and inconvenient.",Technology

It’s finally possible to purchase an audiobook from Spotify’s iPhone app with just a few taps. On Monday, Spotify announced that Apple approved an update that allows users in the US to see audiobook pricing within the app and buy individual audiobooks outside the App Store.

The update also lets Spotify Premium subscribers purchase additional audiobook listening hours. This change follows last month’s Epic Games vs. Apple ruling, which upended the iPhone maker’s control over the App Store. Under the ruling, Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside the app store, nor can it govern how developers point to external purchases.

Spotify now links directly to audiobook purchases. GIF: Spotify

Spotify submitted the update last week, but now it’s official. The music streaming service pulled audiobook purchases from its iOS app in 2022 after accusing Apple of “choking competition” with App Store rules that made it more difficult to purchase audiobooks. Spotify also started letting iPhone users purchase subscriptions outside the App Store earlier this month.

The iOS apps for Kindle, Patreon, and Delta’s emulator have also taken advantage of the court ruling, but Epic Games is still fighting to bring Fortnite back to the App Store. “This change lowers the barriers for more users to embrace their first — or tenth — audiobook, while allowing publishers and authors to reach fans and access new audiences seamlessly,” Spotify said in its announcement.",Technology

Epic v. Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers just ruled that, effective immediately, Apple is no longer allowed to collect fees on purchases made outside apps and blocks the company from restricting how developers can point users to where they can make purchases outside of apps. Apple says it will appeal the order.

The ruling was issued as part of Epic Games’ ongoing legal dispute against Apple, and it’s a major victory for Epic’s arguments. Gonzalez Rogers also says that Apple “willfully” chose not to comply with her previous injunction from her original 2021 ruling. “That [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,” Gonzalez Rogers says.

The judge also referred the case to the US attorney to review it for possible criminal contempt proceedings.

As part of the ruling, the judge says that Apple cannot:

Impose “any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app”

Restrict developers’ style, formatting, or placement of links for purchases outside of an app

Block or limit the “use of buttons or other calls to action”

Interfere with consumers’ choice to leave an app with anything beyond “a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site”

Apple’s senior director of corporate communications, Olivia Dalton, sent a statement to The Verge that reads, “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.”

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says that, following this ruling, the company will bring Fortnite back to the US App Store “next week.” Sweeney is also offering a “peace proposal” from Epic: “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”

In many cases, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of purchases made in its apps, and Gonzalez Rogers’ 2021 ruling forced Apple to allow developers to point to alternative payment options. But Apple instituted a policy that demanded developers pay Apple a 27 percent commission on those purchases, which many companies, including Epic, were unhappy about.

“In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction,” Gonzalez Rogers says. She notes that, inside Apple, App Store chief Phil Schiller advocated for the company to comply with the injunction, but that CEO Tim Cook “chose poorly” by ignoring Schiller and letting CFO Luca Maestri “convince him otherwise.”

https://www.theverge.com/news/679946/apple-rejected-court-attempt-to-stop-app-store-web-links,"is The Verge’s executive editor. He has covered tech, policy, and online creators for over a decade.

Apple will have to continue allowing web links and external payment options in the App Store after its request to halt a judge’s order was rejected today by a higher court.

In April, a federal judge demanded that Apple begin allowing web links, cease restricting how links are formatted, and enable developers to offer external payment options without giving the company a cut of their revenue. Apple promptly appealed and requested that the order be put on hold until the legal proceedings were finished.

But an appeals court has now denied Apple’s emergency request to block the order. The court said it was “not persuaded” that blocking the order was appropriate after weighing Apple’s chances to succeed on appeal, whether Apple would be irreparably harmed, whether other parties would be hurt if the order is halted, and what supports the public interest.

Spotify, Kindle, and other big apps have quickly added options for web purchases

The rejection bodes poorly for Apple’s chance of overturning the order, which stems from a lawsuit by Epic Games. Epic sued Apple over its App Store restrictions back in 2020. Epic notched only a narrow win in the case, with the court ordering Apple to allow developers to communicate with their users about better pricing.

Then, in April, in a scathing ruling, the court said that Apple had repeatedly failed to comply. The judge then gave Apple a more explicit order about how the App Store must be opened up.

In the weeks since, major apps like Spotify and Kindle have taken advantage of the ruling by adding links in their apps to make purchases on the web. Fortnite has returned, too, offering an option between Apple’s in-app payment system and Epic’s own payment and rewards program. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told The Verge this week that there’s currently a 60-40 split in usage between the two systems, with Apple’s still winning out.

“We are disappointed with the decision not to stay the district court’s order, and we’ll continue to argue our case during the appeals process,” says Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton. “As we’ve said before, we strongly disagree with the district court’s opinion. Our goal is to ensure the App Store remains an incredible opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted experience for our users.”",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/news/685733/apple-home-energykit-energy-management-ios26-wwdc,"Apple’s smart home didn’t get a single nod during the WWDC keynote, but it turns out there are some interesting developments coming to the Home app around energy management.

In a video posted to the Apple developer site this week, the company outlined its new EnergyKit framework, which allows developers to integrate energy data from Apple Home in iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 to reduce or shift the electricity usage of their devices to prioritize cleaner and/or less expensive energy. So, for example, your thermostat can reduce its energy use when prices are higher, and your EV can generate a charging schedule based on forecasted prices to save you money.

The Home app can already display your electricity usage and electricity rate, plus the availability of clean energy via the Grid Forecast widget, when connected to your utility provider. (Currently, PG&E is the only supported utility company.) With EnergyKit, developers can use a feature called EnergyKit Guidance that uses these data points to create actions for their devices to reduce or shift energy use.

Apple’s documentation says EnergyKit is currently designed to work with EV chargers and smart thermostat apps. Today, several individual products offer these features. Ecobee and Google Nest thermostats can shift their energy use based on factors such as clean energy availability and rates, and work with demand response programs, and most EV chargers have apps that can create schedules based on energy data.

While EnergyKit is designed to bring data securely from Apple Home into the manufacturer’s app, you can see the potential here to one day manage all of these devices and functions from within Apple Home. It could be laying the groundwork for Apple Home to eventually become a home energy management system (HEMS): a system that can monitor, control, and optimize your energy usage.

We’re already seeing this implemented in smart home platforms like Samsung SmartThings with its AI Energy Mode, Homey (owned by LG), and others. Apple has a lot of catching up to do, as its platform doesn’t currently support energy monitoring from connected devices.

This could lay the groundwork for Apple Home to eventually become a home energy management system

This is likely why EnergyKit is focused on allowing developers to integrate the data from Apple Home into their own apps, as Apple Home doesn’t support EV chargers or energy monitoring of thermostats. However, with Apple’s deep involvement in the Matter smart home standard, it’s possible that support for these devices might come to Apple Home.",Technology

Apple’s documentation says EnergyKit is currently designed to work with EV chargers and smart thermostat apps. Today, several individual products offer these features. Ecobee and Google Nest thermostats can shift their energy use based on factors such as clean energy availability and rates, and work with demand response programs, and most EV chargers have apps that can create schedules based on energy data.

While EnergyKit is designed to bring data securely from Apple Home into the manufacturer’s app, you can see the potential here to one day manage all of these devices and functions from within Apple Home. It could be laying the groundwork for Apple Home to eventually become a home energy management system (HEMS): a system that can monitor, control, and optimize your energy usage.

We’re already seeing this implemented in smart home platforms like Samsung SmartThings with its AI Energy Mode, Homey (owned by LG), and others. Apple has a lot of catching up to do, as its platform doesn’t currently support energy monitoring from connected devices.

This could lay the groundwork for Apple Home to eventually become a home energy management system

This is likely why EnergyKit is focused on allowing developers to integrate the data from Apple Home into their own apps, as Apple Home doesn’t support EV chargers or energy monitoring of thermostats. However, with Apple’s deep involvement in the Matter smart home standard, it’s possible that support for these devices might come to Apple Home.",Technology

https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/,"The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization which hosts and develops Wikipedia, has paused an experiment that showed users AI-generated summaries at the top of articles after an overwhelmingly negative reaction from the Wikipedia editors community.

“Just because Google has rolled out its AI summaries doesn't mean we need to one-up them, I sincerely beg you not to test this, on mobile or anywhere else,” one editor said in response to Wikimedia Foundation’s announcement that it will launch a two-week trial of the summaries on the mobile version of Wikipedia. “This would do immediate and irreversible harm to our readers and to our reputation as a decently trustworthy and serious source. Wikipedia has in some ways become a byword for sober boringness, which is excellent. Let's not insult our readers' intelligence and join the stampede to roll out flashy AI summaries. Which is what these are, although here the word ‘machine-generated’ is used instead.”

Two other editors simply commented, “Yuck.”

For years, Wikipedia has been one of the most valuable repositories of information in the world, and a laudable model for community-based, democratic internet platform governance. Its importance has only grown in the last couple of years during the generative AI boom as it’s one of the only internet platforms that has not been significantly degraded by the flood of AI-generated slop and misinformation. As opposed to Google, which since embracing generative AI has instructed its users to eat glue , Wikipedia’s community has kept its articles relatively high quality. As I recently reported last year, editors are actively working to filter out bad, AI-generated content from Wikipedia.

A page detailing the the AI-generated summaries project, called “Simple Article Summaries,” explains that it was proposed after a discussion at Wikimedia’s 2024 conference, Wikimania, where “Wikimedians discussed ways that AI/machine-generated remixing of the already created content can be used to make Wikipedia more accessible and easier to learn from.” Editors who participated in the discussion thought that these summaries could improve the learning experience on Wikipedia, where some article summaries can be quite dense and filled with technical jargon, but that AI features needed to be cleared labeled as such and that users needed an easy to way to flag issues with “machine-generated/remixed content once it was published or generated automatically.”

In one experiment where summaries were enabled for users who have the Wikipedia browser extension installed, the generated summary showed up at the top of the article, which users had to click to expand and read. That summary was also flagged with a yellow “unverified” label.

An example of what the AI-generated summary looked like.

Wikimedia announced that it was going to run the generated summaries experiment on June 2, and was immediately met with dozens of replies from editors who said “very bad idea,” “strongest possible oppose,” Absolutely not,” etc.

“Yes, human editors can introduce reliability and NPOV [neutral point-of-view] issues. But as a collective mass, it evens out into a beautiful corpus,” one editor said. “With Simple Article Summaries, you propose giving one singular editor with known reliability and NPOV issues a platform at the very top of any given article, whilst giving zero editorial control to others. It reinforces the idea that Wikipedia cannot be relied on, destroying a decade of policy work. It reinforces the belief that unsourced, charged content can be added, because this platforms it. I don't think I would feel comfortable contributing to an encyclopedia like this. No other community has mastered collaboration to such a wondrous extent, and this would throw that away.”

A day later, Wikimedia announced that it would pause the launch of the experiment, but indicated that it’s still interested in AI-generated summaries.

“The Wikimedia Foundation has been exploring ways to make Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects more accessible to readers globally ,” a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson told me in an email. “This two-week, opt-in experiment was focused on making complex Wikipedia articles more accessible to people with different reading levels . For the purposes of this experiment, the summaries were generated by an open-weight Aya model by Cohere. It was meant to gauge interest in a feature like this, and to help us think about the right kind of community moderation systems to ensure humans remain central to deciding what information is shown on Wikipedia.”

“It is common to receive a variety of feedback from volunteers, and we incorporate it in our decisions, and sometimes change course,” the Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson added. “We welcome such thoughtful feedback — this is what continues to make Wikipedia a truly collaborative platform of human knowledge.”

“Reading through the comments, it’s clear we could have done a better job introducing this idea and opening up the conversation here on VPT back in March ,” a Wikimedia Foundation project manager said. VPT, or “village pump technical,” is where The Wikimedia Foundation and the community discuss technical aspects of the platform. “As internet usage changes over time, we are trying to discover new ways to help new generations learn from Wikipedia to sustain our movement into the future. In consequence, we need to figure out how we can experiment in safe ways that are appropriate for readers and the Wikimedia community. Looking back, we realize the next step with this message should have been to provide more of that context for you all and to make the space for folks to engage further.”

The project manager also said that “Bringing generative AI into the Wikipedia reading experience is a serious set of decisions, with important implications, and we intend to treat it as such, and that “We do not have any plans for bringing a summary feature to the wikis without editor involvement. An editor moderation workflow is required under any circumstances, both for this idea, as well as any future idea around AI summarized or adapted content.”",Technology

Apple packed a bunch of major updates into its annual Worldwide Developer Conference keynote. During the event, the company showed off the sleek design refresh coming to its operating systems, as well as a mix of new features for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, and more.

Here’s a roundup of some of the most exciting changes Apple announced during the keynote — you can watch our edited version that cuts it down to under thirty minutes right here.

As predicted, Apple has given each of its operating systems new version numbers that now align with the year after their release, rather than the version number. The new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. They’ll be coming out in late 2025, but still, it’s easier to remember that than iOS 19, watchOS 12, and macOS 16.

The operating systems are available as developer betas starting today and will be available to all users this fall.

Apple is revamping the design across its operating systems. Now they will have a new Liquid Glass theme that adds more transparency to buttons, switches, sliders, text, and media controls throughout their interfaces.

The date, time, notification previews on iOS 26’s lockscreen will also adopt the new look, allowing you to get a clear view of your wallpaper behind all the text.

New looks for the Camera, Safari, and Phone apps

As part of its broader redesign, Apple revealed revamps for some of its core apps in iOS 26. Now, webpages in Safari will take up your entire screen. The Camera app also has a simplified layout that shows you two main options — photo and video — and you can swipe on the tool bar to reveal other modes, such as Slow-Mo and Cinematic.

The Phone app is getting an upgrade, as well, as it will now have a layout that combines favorites, recents, and voicemails into one panel, while calls, contacts, and keypad remain on the bottom of the app.

Apple is bringing a major update to iPadOS 26 that should make multitasking easier. New windowing capabilities will let you resize app windows, place them around your display, and open more windows at once. It’s also adding a more precise mouse pointer and a new menu bar, allowing you to swipe down on an app to view various options and commands. It all looks a lot more Mac-like.

iPadOS 26 is also getting a version of the Mac’s Preview app to view and annotate image and files.

https://www.theverge.com/news/679221/apple-ios-macos-watchos-ipados-26-name,"Apple has announced a sweeping change to how it names — or, rather, numbers — its operating systems. Instead of being numbered by how many versions each has had, they are now named based on the year. Well, next year, to be exact.

So we have iOS 26 coming to this year’s iPhones, and macOS Tahoe 26 for Apple’s computers. iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26 complete the set. In future years, the numbers will tick up together, making it easy to figure out if any Apple device is running the latest version of its software or not.

The new numbering is a clear simplification of Apple’s prior system, which included iOS 18 at the same time as watchOS 11 and visionOS 2. Apple announced the change during the keynote address at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which runs throughout the week. It doesn’t come entirely as a surprise; Bloomberg reported in late May that Apple was planning the change.",Technology

Google has launched a bevy of noteworthy additions to its Home app, most of which are available now in public preview (which you can enroll in here). The biggest news, according to The Verge’s smart home expert Jen Tuohy, is that picture-in-picture support has arrived for Nest Cams on whichever Google TV product you might have. This is self-explanatory, but nice to have (even though we’re surprised Google didn’t launch this sooner). It will let you peer through what your various Nest Cams see, conveniently located on a portion of your TV’s screen. This one’s limited to a public preview for Google TV.

It wouldn’t be a Google announcement in 2025 without AI being part of the conversation. Fittingly, Gemini now has broader smart home controls than before. You can broadcast your voice through connected speakers or search your camera clip history by typing a specific query in the Gemini app. It seems like voice dictation for these requests isn’t on the table for now. This builds on Google’s work to move more basic smart home tasks that would normally be performed by the Google Assistant, as well as some more involved, AI-powered capabilities, into Gemini.

Next up, for any cameras you may have linked to your Google Home app, you’ll be able to jump forward and backward within recorded footage in to second intervals by double-tapping on the left or right side of your device’s screen (a la fast-forwarding in YouTube on mobile), which should hopefully make it easier to find the moments you’re looking for.

Some of the new changes are focused on customization of the Home app, including improvements to automations. Google says automations can be made with fewer steps directly in the app, with new ways to get more specific about the automatic. Automations can now be made based on presence sensing in the app, which uses phone location, as well as the Soli sensors in some Google Nest products (the Nest Learning Thermostat 4th gen, the Nest Thermostat, and the second-gen Nest Hub), to determine if anyone is home.

Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide status is now accessible within the Home app, and no longer requires using the standalone Nest app to monitor. Google notes that you’ll “be able to receive critical safety alerts and heads-up notifications, run essential safety check-ups, and hush alarms” from within Home.

The Home app has expanded support for third-party Matter-enabled smart locks, with numerous configurable settings, from managing guests, editing passcodes, receiving lock notifications, and more.

Favorites are getting expanded. Google has added more kinds of tiles that can be pinned, like an indoor temperature dashboard, Wi-Fi actions, and a master light switch to turn all lights in your home on or off. Additionally, the Home app lets you set different Favorites for additional devices you may use other than a phone, like a smart watch or a tablet.

Even if you’re away from your phone, there are added controls to Google Home for web that let you make modifications on a browser. Google only mentions the ability to adjust lights, set a temperature, and unlock a door in the press release, but says that more options are available in public preview now.

Lastly, the Home Summary widget that was revealed at I/O 2025 for Pixel phones is available to test on an invite-only basis.",Technology

Google rolled out a bunch of new features with Android 16 on Tuesday, but the company appears to be saving its big Material 3 Expressive redesign for a future update. The update doesn’t feature the design language’s revamped elements, and a source tells Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman that Google is planning to launch the new look on September 3rd, 2025, instead.

With Android 16, Google is starting to roll out support for Live Updates with progress-centric notifications and enhanced settings for users with hearing aids. The updates are coming to Pixel devices first, but according to Google, Android users will have to wait for another update to see Live Updates “fully realized.”

https://www.theverge.com/news/685045/sam-altman-average-chatgpt-energy-water,"is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a blog post published Tuesday, says an average ChatGPT query uses about 0.000085 gallons of water, or “roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon.” He made the claim as part of a broader post on his predictions about how AI will change the world.

“People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,” he says. He also argues that “the cost of intelligence should eventually converge to near the cost of electricity.” OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how Altman came to those figures.

AI companies have come under scrutiny for energy costs of their technology. This year, for example, researchers forecast that AI could consume more power than Bitcoin mining by the end of the year. In an article last year, The Washington Post worked with researchers to determine that a 100-word email “generated by an AI chatbot using GPT-4” required “a little more than 1 bottle.” The publication also found that water usage can depend on where a datacenter is located.",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/ipad/684229/ipados-26-hands-on-multitasking-mac,"I genuinely never expected to say this: it appears Apple finally figured out multitasking on the iPad. With iPadOS 26, the company hasn’t completely taken off the guardrails for how you can use and place apps on your tablet, but it came awfully close. With a couple of clever iPad-specific tricks, and better support for a mouse or trackpad, the whole system just makes sense in a way it never has before. I’ve been running the very first developer beta for less than a day on an 11-inch iPad Air, and I can already sense a change in how I use my tablet.

The new multitasking system is mostly pretty easy to understand. You unlock the iPad and you’re dropped onto the homescreen full of app icons, same as always. When you open an app, it opens full-screen by default; at WWDC, Apple executives were careful to note that if you don’t want to encounter the new multitasking system, you never have to, and I think that’s true. (You can even turn the whole windowing system off in settings, if you want to.) But as soon as you tap and drag the little icon in the bottom right corner of the window, the app starts to shrink. You can make the app any size you want — any size the developer supports, at least, which does vary pretty widely — and put it anywhere on the screen. If you grab the top bar of an app and sort of toss it off to one side, it’ll automatically fill half the screen. Tap the new stoplight menu, and you can either close the app or make it full screen again.

Once you’ve resized an app, that is now the size and placement of that app. If you close and re-open it, it’ll open in the same size and place until you move it or resize it again. I’ve come to think of this space on my iPad as kind of an “app screen,” next to my homescreen, organized and laid out however I like. And unlike Stage Manager, everything is always how I left it. You can put as many apps on this screen as you want – I’ve had a dozen on there at a time, which is way more than makes any logical sense and certainly more than you can see at once.

Exposé is the best way to see everything you have open, all at once. Image: David Pierce / The Verge

At least in this early beta, there are a couple of quirks to the system. For one thing, I absolutely cannot figure out what the yellow “minimize” button does. You tap it, and the app closes, just like an app normally closes, and re-opens in place just like an app you’ve closed. I suspect this is a new app state developers will have to take advantage of, particularly as the iPad’s new background processing comes to fruition, but so far it doesn’t seem to do anything new.

You can only have one app active at a time, but you can scroll up and down in an app in the background — if you’re using a mouse or trackpad. If you’re touching the screen, you have to tap the app to bring it to the foreground before you can do anything with it at all. I’ve been using the CMD-Tab app switcher much more to quickly jump between things on the app screen, but it doesn’t always show every app I have open. The only way to get to everything is through the Exposé feature, which works well but is just a slightly slower way to move around.

By and large, though, it all just works. You can combine multitasking with Stage Manager, to turn your one organized app screen into a handful of them. You can run a bunch of windows on your iPad and a bunch more on an external monitor, or at least you can in theory — there’s a bug in the first beta that makes the whole system crash every time I open a second app on an external display. (I’m not super concerned about the functionality in the long run, but as always, install beta software at your own peril.)

The menu bar goes a long way toward making the iPad more Mac-ish. Image: David Pierce / The Verge

There are a few other Mac-style things about iPadOS 26 that help make multitasking work. First is that stoplight menu, which shows up at the top left corner of every app and makes it easier to close or maximize windows. There’s also the new pointer, which appears when you connect a Magic Keyboard or other mouse or trackpad. I think I underestimated how much better it would feel to have a small, more exact arrow pointer rather than the old circle. And there’s the new menu bar, which appears at the top of the screen and offers all the settings and options for whatever app you’re currently using.

In just a few hours with iPadOS 26, I’ve noticed a couple of big changes to how I use my tablet. I’m spending much less time on the homescreen, which almost doesn’t need to exist anymore — I’m launching apps with Spotlight, resizing them on my app screen, and getting back to them with CMD-Tab or Exposé. I’ve been using the dock more, too, as a quick way to get to the apps I use most when they’re not already front and center. It’s all a lot like the way I use my Mac, and it’s amazing how quickly that muscle memory kicked in.

Can I interest you in a completely unusable number of apps on your screen at once? Yes! Image: David Pierce / The Verge

Whenever I’ve tried to use multiple apps on the iPad, I’ve always felt like I was fighting the system. It would let you look at multiple things at a time, but it wanted you to see everything full screen. Now, and especially once developers update for even more fluid window sizes, multitasking feels like a first-class tablet citizen. It feels like a Mac in the sense that it feels like everything is happening in the same place, on the same screen, rather than constantly bouncing you between different full-screen experiences. Is it busier and occasionally more chaotic than the traditionally focused iPad vibe? You betcha! But I love it so far.",Technology

https://www.semafor.com/article/06/11/2025/google-names-new-chief-ai-architect-to-advance-developments,"Google has been undergoing broad changes as a company since ChatGPT upended the tech industry. It merged DeepMind, a company it acquired in 2010, with Google Brain, and installed Hassabis at the helm of its AI effort.

Across the company, it’s streamlining the way teams work in an effort to speed up product development. That has meant buyouts, layoffs, and leadership changes.

“We’re entering a new phase of the AI platform shift. It will require us to also shift into a new gear as a company to ensure our products are evolving just as quickly as our models,” Pichai wrote in the memo.

In April, Google moved Josh Woodward, head of Google Labs, into the lead role at Gemini. Woodward oversaw the creation of one of the company’s hit AI products called NotebookLM, which turns text into a podcast-like show.

Google is hoping for more successes like NotebookLM. But so far, the pace of innovation on AI models has outpaced product development.

In some ways, there is no way around that. New capabilities must be created before new products can utilize them.

On the other hand, Kavukcuoglu has been working to brief people around the company on where those capabilities are likely to lead so that product developers can think ahead.

In the past, the tech industry could count on a somewhat predictable and constant rate of change, as computers got smaller and faster over time. But AI has not yet settled into a Moore’s Law-like trajectory. Advances come in spurts and have been moving incredibly fast.

If Google doesn’t invent new ways to use AI, there’s a danger its competitors will. In some ways, that is the story of ChatGPT, which used a breakthrough in AI architecture pioneered by Google’s own researchers, at a time when those researchers were encouraged to share their discoveries with the world.

Now, AI is changing the way consumers search the web, with some early adopters using ChatGPT or Perplexity as their search engines.

On Tuesday, The Verge reported the company is offering buyouts in its Search organization — the core of its business that generates the majority of the company’s revenue.

New Gemini capabilities like Project Mariner, which can autonomously control web browsers, and Astra, which can understand the physical world, show the seeds of promising new products.

It’s now the job of Pichai’s newest direct report to see that they end up powering Google’s new products.",Technology

https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093215/rivian-r2-revealed-ev-suv-price-specs-price,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Rivian revealed its next electric vehicle, the R2, a more affordable SUV that the company is counting on having a much broader appeal than its stylish — and expensive — R1T trucks and R1S SUVs.

The R2 won’t go into production until the first half of 2026, but when it does it will come with an estimated range of over 300 miles, a 0–60mph time of three seconds, and a starting price of $45,000 — placing it slightly below the current average selling price for a new internal combustion vehicle. The price could be even lower if it ends up qualifying for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit.

Interested buyers can reserve an R2 starting today for $100, with deliveries expected to begin in the first half of 2026. Whether Rivian can stick to that schedule will be a central challenge for the EV company. For the R1T truck, for example, some of the first customers were forced to endure long wait times before receiving their EV.

Making an electric vehicle that’s affordable to a broader swath of people is crucial for Rivian’s long-term viability. The company’s R1T truck starts at $70,000, while the R1S SUV kicks off at $76,000 and can climb as high as $88,000. Rivian needs a less expensive vehicle if it’s to successfully compete with Tesla and other legacy automakers who currently dominate the sales chart.

Since coming out of stealth in 2018, the company has positioned itself as a maker of adventure vehicles that are ideal for camping and off-road antics. Sure, Rivian’s vehicles are mostly used for more mundane excursions, like trips to Home Depot and soccer practice. But Rivian knows that some of the most popular vehicles on the road today are trucks and SUVs that are dirt-road and towing aspirants.

The Rivian R2 will come in single-, dual-, and tri-motor variations. The vehicle will come with Tesla’s NACS port built natively into the vehicle. Interestingly, the charge ports will be in the rear of the vehicle, as compared to the front as with the R1T and R1S. This is likely because Tesla puts its ports in the rear for better access to the company’s Superchargers.

The R2 will feature Rivian’s new 4695 cylindrical battery cells

The R2 will feature Rivian’s new 4695 cylindrical battery cells, which is 15 mm taller than Tesla’s 4680 cells. And the company is promising a more powerful computer, complimented by a sensor suite that includes 11 cameras and five radars. The R2 will have “dramatically enhanced autonomous capabilities,” though the company didn’t specify what level of automation it was shooting for.

It’s 185.6 inches in length, which is less than two inches shorter than a Tesla Model Y or about 15 inches less than an R1S. Its width is 75 inches, or 84.4 inches with the mirrors, and the height is 66.9 inches. The wheelbase is 115.6 inches long.

There’s a substantial frunk (front truck) — Rivian described it as “roomy” — which can hold a carry-on suitcase plus a backpack, or up to six reusable grocery bags. Keeping with its “adventure” ethos, the R2 will also feature a nifty bike mount system that can connect easily with the vehicle’s rear accessory ports.

The interior of the R2 is a big change from the R1 lineup. Noting that they’ve been criticized for failing to include a glove compartment in the R1T and R1S, Scaringe said they “overdelivered” with the R2, which will feature two gloveboxes. Both appear to be fairly massive, looking ready to take all the gloves you have.

The steering wheel also has a new feature: two giant scroll wheels. The wheels will have dynamic haptic feedback, but Scaringe says they need to be used to be really appreciated. “It takes our existing scroll wheel and really up levels it to a degree that’s hard to fully appreciate unless you’re sitting in the car,” he said.

The rear seats fold down for additional space — and the front seats fold down as well. Scaringe said this would be an ideal configuration for anyone interested in sleeping overnight in their Rivian R2.

The rest of the interior looks to be simplified, which makes sense for a more mass-market vehicle. The infotainment system will run on Rivian’s own operating system, and like Tesla, won’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. And the door still features a built-in flashlight on the side, a feature carried over from the R1 vehicles.

In addition to the R2, the company also announced the R3, a sportier compact SUV, and its performance variant, the R3X. Rivian said the R3 would be even less expensive than the R2, but didn’t release the exact price. Reservations for the R3 will go live at a later date.

“These represent our future,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the event. “These represent what we’ve been building to... with the R1 products and in positioning Rivian to take that further and make that more accessible to more people.”

In unveiling its plans to put its next vehicle into production, Rivian faces an existential test. The company reported losing $1.58 billion over the last three months of 2023, bringing its net annual losses to $5.4 billion. It also announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its salaried employees, the third such round of layoffs in the last two years. It is planning to shut down its factory in Normal, Illinois, for several weeks to bring improvements to the R1 line. And it will soon break ground on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia.

The R2 can’t save Rivian on its own. But it will certainly play a major role in keeping the company afloat.",Automobile
https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad,"The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we can’t just forget about the original Switch. We’ve still got love for the console, and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here.

Now, you may already know that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.

In this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (PowerA and PDP make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)

Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions, which we feature below.

Featured in this article

What we’re looking for How we test Nintendo Switch controllers Collapse We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off. Connectivity Collapse Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too. Quality Collapse Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches? Extra features and customization Collapse Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity? Value Collapse Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?

The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes

Ever since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).

Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.

The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.

Given the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.

The best Switch controller for handheld mode

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No

I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.

The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.

The Split Pad Pro fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set. Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge

The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).

The company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.

The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch

Supported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes

On the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.

But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).

Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.

GuliKit’s newest Switch controllers offer ample customization. Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge

The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.

In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.

The best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update), PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No

8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake.

It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.

The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.

The 8BitDo Ultimate is a terrific alternative to Nintendo’s official pro controller. Image: 8BitDo

As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.

A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update) PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No

The 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside.

It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.

You can get the 8BitDo Pro 2 in a variety of fun styles. Image: 8BitDo

With 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks.

On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for around $40 (or slightly more if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).

An adapter that lets you use your own controllers

There are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch (or Switch 2) controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)

To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.

8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads. Image: 8BitDo

8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.

If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.

Other Switch controllers we tested

We like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).

We recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.

We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($41.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.

What’s coming next?

The Switch 2 is here. Nintendo’s new console is both bigger and more powerful than the original model. There are many new accessories at launch, including new Joy-Con 2 controllers, plus a refreshed Switch Pro Controller that features customizable rear paddles. There’s also a Switch 2-exclusive wireless GameCube controller releasing that Switch Online subscribers have a chance to buy.

That brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has published an in-depth support page regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original (and official) Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button. However, compatibility with third-party products may be hit-and-miss. 8BitDo has released updates for some of its controllers, and other companies will likely follow suit.

As for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with anti-drifting TMR analog sticks that costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives in June.",Technology

And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).

Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.

The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.

Given the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.

The best Switch controller for handheld mode

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No

I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.

The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.

The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).

The company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.

The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch

Supported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes

On the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.

But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).

Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.

The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.

In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.

The best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update), PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No

8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake.

It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.

The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.

The 8BitDo Ultimate is a terrific alternative to Nintendo’s official pro controller. Image: 8BitDo

As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.

A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update) PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No

The 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside.

It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.

You can get the 8BitDo Pro 2 in a variety of fun styles. Image: 8BitDo

With 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks.

On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for around $40 (or slightly more if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).

An adapter that lets you use your own controllers

There are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch (or Switch 2) controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)

To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.

8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads. Image: 8BitDo

8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.

If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.

Other Switch controllers we tested

We like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).

We recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.

We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($41.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.

What’s coming next?

The Switch 2 is here. Nintendo’s new console is both bigger and more powerful than the original model. There are many new accessories at launch, including new Joy-Con 2 controllers, plus a refreshed Switch Pro Controller that features customizable rear paddles. There’s also a Switch 2-exclusive wireless GameCube controller releasing that Switch Online subscribers have a chance to buy.

That brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has published an in-depth support page regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original (and official) Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button. However, compatibility with third-party products may be hit-and-miss. 8BitDo has released updates for some of its controllers, and other companies will likely follow suit.

As for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with anti-drifting TMR analog sticks that costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives in June.",Technology

https://www.theverge.com/ipad/684229/ipados-26-hands-on-multitasking-mac#comments,"I genuinely never expected to say this: it appears Apple finally figured out multitasking on the iPad. With iPadOS 26, the company hasn’t completely taken off the guardrails for how you can use and place apps on your tablet, but it came awfully close. With a couple of clever iPad-specific tricks, and better support for a mouse or trackpad, the whole system just makes sense in a way it never has before. I’ve been running the very first developer beta for less than a day on an 11-inch iPad Air, and I can already sense a change in how I use my tablet.

The new multitasking system is mostly pretty easy to understand. You unlock the iPad and you’re dropped onto the homescreen full of app icons, same as always. When you open an app, it opens full-screen by default; at WWDC, Apple executives were careful to note that if you don’t want to encounter the new multitasking system, you never have to, and I think that’s true. (You can even turn the whole windowing system off in settings, if you want to.) But as soon as you tap and drag the little icon in the bottom right corner of the window, the app starts to shrink. You can make the app any size you want — any size the developer supports, at least, which does vary pretty widely — and put it anywhere on the screen. If you grab the top bar of an app and sort of toss it off to one side, it’ll automatically fill half the screen. Tap the new stoplight menu, and you can either close the app or make it full screen again.

Once you’ve resized an app, that is now the size and placement of that app. If you close and re-open it, it’ll open in the same size and place until you move it or resize it again. I’ve come to think of this space on my iPad as kind of an “app screen,” next to my homescreen, organized and laid out however I like. And unlike Stage Manager, everything is always how I left it. You can put as many apps on this screen as you want – I’ve had a dozen on there at a time, which is way more than makes any logical sense and certainly more than you can see at once.

Exposé is the best way to see everything you have open, all at once. Image: David Pierce / The Verge

At least in this early beta, there are a couple of quirks to the system. For one thing, I absolutely cannot figure out what the yellow “minimize” button does. You tap it, and the app closes, just like an app normally closes, and re-opens in place just like an app you’ve closed. I suspect this is a new app state developers will have to take advantage of, particularly as the iPad’s new background processing comes to fruition, but so far it doesn’t seem to do anything new.

You can only have one app active at a time, but you can scroll up and down in an app in the background — if you’re using a mouse or trackpad. If you’re touching the screen, you have to tap the app to bring it to the foreground before you can do anything with it at all. I’ve been using the CMD-Tab app switcher much more to quickly jump between things on the app screen, but it doesn’t always show every app I have open. The only way to get to everything is through the Exposé feature, which works well but is just a slightly slower way to move around.

By and large, though, it all just works. You can combine multitasking with Stage Manager, to turn your one organized app screen into a handful of them. You can run a bunch of windows on your iPad and a bunch more on an external monitor, or at least you can in theory — there’s a bug in the first beta that makes the whole system crash every time I open a second app on an external display. (I’m not super concerned about the functionality in the long run, but as always, install beta software at your own peril.)

The menu bar goes a long way toward making the iPad more Mac-ish. Image: David Pierce / The Verge

There are a few other Mac-style things about iPadOS 26 that help make multitasking work. First is that stoplight menu, which shows up at the top left corner of every app and makes it easier to close or maximize windows. There’s also the new pointer, which appears when you connect a Magic Keyboard or other mouse or trackpad. I think I underestimated how much better it would feel to have a small, more exact arrow pointer rather than the old circle. And there’s the new menu bar, which appears at the top of the screen and offers all the settings and options for whatever app you’re currently using.

In just a few hours with iPadOS 26, I’ve noticed a couple of big changes to how I use my tablet. I’m spending much less time on the homescreen, which almost doesn’t need to exist anymore — I’m launching apps with Spotlight, resizing them on my app screen, and getting back to them with CMD-Tab or Exposé. I’ve been using the dock more, too, as a quick way to get to the apps I use most when they’re not already front and center. It’s all a lot like the way I use my Mac, and it’s amazing how quickly that muscle memory kicked in.

Can I interest you in a completely unusable number of apps on your screen at once? Yes! Image: David Pierce / The Verge

Whenever I’ve tried to use multiple apps on the iPad, I’ve always felt like I was fighting the system. It would let you look at multiple things at a time, but it wanted you to see everything full screen. Now, and especially once developers update for even more fluid window sizes, multitasking feels like a first-class tablet citizen. It feels like a Mac in the sense that it feels like everything is happening in the same place, on the same screen, rather than constantly bouncing you between different full-screen experiences. Is it busier and occasionally more chaotic than the traditionally focused iPad vibe? You betcha! But I love it so far.",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/news/684199/splatoon-raiders-switch-2-spinoff#comments,"The squid kids are coming to the Switch 2. In its mobile news app today, Nintendo made some surprise announcements about its ink-shooting franchise.

First up, a spinoff game called Splatoon Raiders is in the works for the Switch 2, though there aren’t a lot of details. The new game will take players to an area known as the Spirhalite Islands, investigating some kind of mystery alongside the fictional pop group Deep Cut. It appears the game may be a single-player offshoot of the franchise, though there is currently no word on when it will launch.

Meanwhile, the online shooter Splatoon 3 is getting a big update on June 12th, which will bring it up to version 10.0. It will introduce 30 remixed weapons and the classic Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon on the Wii U. The game will also be getting enhanced for the Switch 2, with what Nintendo calls “more detailed visuals” and a “smoother appearance” in certain locations. Players will be able to play against each other on both platforms. The update will be available for free.",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world,"Now that I’ve had a Nintendo Switch 2 in my hands for a few days, I can say pretty confidently that this feels a lot like a Switch. You know, only more. The differences between console generations have become increasingly blurry over the last few years, and Nintendo’s latest device is the blurriest yet. It really is just a bigger, more powerful Switch. It’s not a radical update to Nintendo’s portable console — but it is a pleasant one.

There are some elements I still need to test properly for our full review — like the mouse controls and GameChat social features — but after an entire weekend spent playing a lot of Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, and a bunch of other games, I can also tell that it’ll be pretty hard going back to the original Switch.

Here are some of my initial thoughts.

A seamless transition

One of the best trends in modern gaming is how your library is able to move along with you when you upgrade your hardware. This has never been a strong suit for Nintendo, which historically has forced users to start over from scratch with a new device. But the company seems to have gotten it right with the Switch 2. After logging into my Nintendo account and spending 15 minutes transferring the contents of my OLED Switch over to the Switch 2, everything was there. Even my online accounts, like with Fortnite, were already logged in, and the old games worked just as they did before.

It may seem like a basic thing — and it is — but it’s nice that Nintendo made this part of the process much more seamless this time around.

Big games are big in more ways than one

One of the promises of the Switch 2 is that larger games, particularly big open-world titles, can now run much better on the beefed up hardware. I’ve been testing this so far by putting a few hours into Cyberpunk 2077. And while it obviously doesn’t look as good as it does on a high-end PC, PlayStation, or Xbox, it still looks and runs pretty great. I haven’t noticed any major issues with the game either in docked or handheld mode. The game doesn’t look as sharp when playing on a portable, and I spotted the odd blurry texture on in-game billboards, but it ran nice and smooth otherwise.

The flipside is that the Switch 2 now has some pretty hefty file sizes to deal with. Cyberpunk 2077 is nearly 60GB, while Street Fighter 6 is 49.2GB, and Fortnite is 37.8GB. That’s smaller than on a PS5, for example, where blockbuster games are often pushing 100GB, but it does mean I’ve already had to manage my software to make things fit.

Hardware size hasn’t been an issue

The other size differences — the bigger screen and heavier hardware — haven’t been an issue for me so far. I sat out in the sun playing Mario Kart World until the battery was nearly dead, and I didn’t really notice any discomfort, aside from the sore right thumb that is the price of playing Mario Kart with any degree of intensity. My 12-year-old also spent two hours playing the upgraded Pokémon Violet and claimed it was a comfortable experience, but that might’ve just been a ploy for more screentime.

The Joy-Cons are very satisfying

Functionally, the new controllers are almost identical. Although I have to admit, I keep hitting the GameChat button when I mean to press Home. So there’s been a little bit of relearning muscle memory there. But the best part is the new magnetic connectors, which are extremely satisfying to snap into the Switch 2 and its controller grip. The big, chunky button on the back feels very good to press, to the point that I’ve found myself fiddling with it while waiting for things to load.

Shareable screenshots, finally

This may be a niche concern, but as someone who takes a lot of screenshots while I play games — so I can share important details about public transportation in the Mushroom Kingdom — it’s great that they’re so much easier to share now. Before, I had to scan two different QR codes to get them on my phone. Now, I just click the upload button, and they appear in the Switch mobile app. It works essentially the same way as on the PS5, which is good news for posters like me.

There aren’t a lot of major Switch 2 exclusives at launch, but there are a lot of existing games that have been enhanced for the new hardware. My colleagues have already written about how much better The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Fortnite play on the Switch 2. I agree that both of those are solid upgrades, and I even played through Fortnite’s most recent live event on the Switch 2 without any issues.

But I’ve also been spending a whole lot of time in No Man’s Sky (to nobody’s surprise), and it really is a noticeable difference. While the game technically worked on the original hardware, it was also much slower and uglier than on any other platform. The Switch 2 version isn’t the best-looking, of course, but it still looks and runs great, even in portable mode.

I’ve found myself really getting lost in this virtual universe once again, which is much easier to do when you can just take it with you.

According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.

“Prime Video ad load has gradually increased to four to six minutes per hour,” an Amazon representative wrote to an ad buyer in an email obtained by ADWEEK. The exchange occurred earlier this month.

The increase, which Amazon had telegraphed to investors but has not publicly acknowledged to consumers, gives the company significantly more inventory to sell across its rapidly expanding streaming business.

“They told us the ad load would be increasing,” said Kendra Tang, programmatic supervisor at Rain the Growth Agency. “That’s been confirmed recently when we noticed more avails in the system.”

The uptick in commercials is the latest sign of maturation from the streaming service, which in recent months has debuted a slew of new products designed to make it more appealing to marketers. Its show-level data, private auction deals, and forthcoming contextual offerings have all sought to separate Prime Video from its competitive set.

Amazon did not respond to specific questions about increasing its ad load, but in a statement referred to its broader ad strategy.

“Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.”

Why ad load increased

When Prime Video launched its ad tier, Amazon made commercials the default for all Prime subscribers, prompting backlash from some consumers but giving the company an immediate footprint of over 150 million monthly ad-supported viewers.

Still, to ease that transition, Amazon kept its ad load light. “They had to make the ad load palatable,” said Doug Paladino of PMG.

But by late 2024, Amazon had already told investors it would “ramp up” the volume in 2025. According to buyers, the shift reflects a broader effort to right-size Prime Video’s inventory relative to the rest of the market.

“This is a lot of them coming back to equilibrium,” Paladino said. “They have more subscribers than any other ad-supported streamer, but many weren’t watching enough for that to matter. More ad load helps bring that back into balance.”

How Amazon compares to other streamers

At its new level, Prime Video’s ad load begins to mirror broader industry standards.

Netflix still offers the lightest ad experience, while services like Hulu, Tubi, and Paramount+ carry heavier loads. “Prime Video is now firmly in that middle tier,” Paladino said, noting its ad volume now matches other premium platforms.

Critically, streamers’ ad load generally still pales in comparison to what viewers experience on linear television, which typically ranges from 13 to 16 minutes per hour.

By increasing its ad load, Amazon has created more inventory to sell. More inventory typically leads to lower CPMs, and while buyers haven’t yet seen major drops, they expect them to come soon. Currently, buyers said that Amazon Prime Video CPMs fall somewhere in the middle compared with other streamers.

“That’s the upside here,” said David Nyurenberg, senior vice president of digital at InterMedia Advertising. “A biddable environment, plus greater supply, should allow buyers to find impressions at more efficient rates. It’s a good thing if they can scale without degrading user experience.”

“If Prime Video drops 10% to 20% in price, it could move spend their way,” Paladino said. “We’re in a tariff-heavy retail environment where clients need to do more with less. A cheaper premium platform helps.”

The increased inventory should also make it easier for ad buyers to target niche categories at scale, according to Nyurenberg. That would help advertisers take further advantage of the granular data capabilities it offers through its demand-side platform.

However, not everyone is convinced that more inventory solves Prime Video’s challenges.

Vicky Chang, vice president of media at Tatari, said that for many advertisers, the barrier is less about price and more about measurement.

“It’s still hard to measure Prime Video’s performance against other platforms,” Chang said. “Amazon does measurement, but only within its own ecosystem. That makes it hard to justify the high CPMs, especially when results can’t be benchmarked elsewhere.”

Buyers are also monitoring for performance degradation as ad load increases.

“For us, lower CPMs are appealing, but it comes with a viewer tolerance tradeoff, which might lead to tune-out or effectiveness declines,” said Markacy president and chief operating officer Ryan Mason. “It might take a while to fully observe that in the market—if it does happen—but tracking ad revenue per advertiser is something Prime will be managing tightly as a harbinger of how effective Prime Video ads truly are.”

What comes next

The increase in ad load puts Prime Video’s ad load closer to industry norms, and buyers say Amazon is still within acceptable bounds.

But the move underscores Amazon’s broader ambition to scale its advertising business, both on Prime Video and across its broader media ecosystem.

“There’s a clear strategy here,” said Sam Bloom, head of partnerships at PMG. “They’ve been investing in tools like Amazon Marketing Cloud, Publisher Cloud, and private auctions to make this a full-fledged ad platform. Increasing ad load is part of creating enough scale to support that.”

Still, as Amazon grows its inventory, it will have to balance monetization with viewer tolerance and advertiser expectations.

“As long as the ad load stays manageable and performance holds up, we’ll keep investing,” Paladino said. “But if it slips, spend follows the results.”",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/21276979/phone-protest-demonstration-activism-digital-how-to-security-privacy,"Back in June 2020, when this article was first written, people were taking to the streets to organize for justice and protest against systemic racism and police brutality. There have been several other flashpoints for protests since then (for example, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade), but the recent activities of ICE, especially in Los Angeles, have now resulted in huge, nationwide demonstrations. As of this writing, the Trump administration has reacted by deploying the national guard and military forces, making conflict even more likely.

Because of this escalation, it is possible that, if you’re a participant, you may find yourself arrested or otherwise detained. In that case, one of the first things that will be confiscated is likely to be your phone and / or smartwatch — both of which offer access to a great deal of your personal data. So it has become more important than ever to guard that data if there is a chance of confrontation or arrest.

The following are a number of tips on how to at least somewhat secure your data when carrying a phone. (If you also have a smartwatch, you may want to simply leave that home.) Some general resources with information on staying safe while at a demonstration are listed at the end of this article.

Be aware

If you’re attending or even just watching the protests, then be aware: not only is your phone a trove of information about you and the people you communicate with, but it also functions as a tracking device. That’s why it’s important to keep your digital footprint as small as possible — any evidence placing people at protests could be enough to get them arrested.

You should account for the fact that your phone may get lost, stolen, or broken. There’s also a risk of your phone being confiscated by authorities — which means that if they’re able to unlock your phone, they’ll have access to data on you and people you know. It could give authorities access to information about what is being organized and who is doing the organizing and might even give them the information necessary to shut down or prevent protests and arrest those involved.

It’s important to keep your digital footprint as small as possible

In other words, it never hurts to prepare for the worst.

The steps we’ve listed here are a basic start toward protecting your privacy before you attend a protest, but there are additional precautions you can take. Circumstances and situations vary, and none of these methods is 100 percent foolproof, but they do offer increased security for you and your info.

Data security is an ongoing issue, and we’re still learning the ways in which information is collected and sold, what kinds are gathered, who gets access to them, and what can be learned from them. While the following strategies are important if you’re participating in a protest, they are also useful if you want to be careful in your everyday technology use.

Here are some strategies you should consider.

If you can, leave your phone at home

Your phone carries a lot of information about you specifically. When you take it to different locations, it can reveal where you live, where you work, and what protests or demonstrations you’ve attended. In addition, every app you use collects a certain amount of information and has a detailed log of your activity. So, for example, if you use social networking at a protest, that activity and your social media account get tied to the protest. And if your phone is confiscated during or after the protest, it’s possible (according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation) that law enforcement could use a forensic tool to try to extract information from the device.

Your phone carries a lot of information about you

If that’s a concern, it’s better to just avoid carrying all of that data with you. If you can, purchase and use a burner phone instead, and only turn it on when you’re at the site of the demonstration. Download and use more secure, encrypted apps for communication rather than the default text messaging apps on the phone (we’ll share some examples later).

If you’re bringing your own phone, back up your device in case it gets confiscated and remove all personally identifiable information from the phone. Since that may be difficult, you might want to wipe your phone entirely (after you’ve backed up all your stuff, of course) and add just the apps and information you think you’ll need. Try to keep your phone off unless you absolutely need to use it.

Use a password rather than biometrics to secure your data

It’s a good idea to change the settings on your phone so that you can’t unlock it using your fingerprint or facial recognition. These methods make it easier for someone else to get into your phone, especially if you’re there, and law enforcement can legally force people to unlock their phones using their fingerprint or facial recognition. Instead, use a passcode, PIN, or password, which are protected under the Fifth Amendment.

Adjust your settings so that you can’t see message content in notifications when your phone is locked. At the protest, try not to unlock your phone unless you absolutely have to. If you are taking photos and videos, try to access your camera without unlocking your phone. (On an Android phone, this varies depending on your model; for example, on a Pixel, you just press the Power key twice. On an iPhone, you can open the camera from the lockscreen by long-pressing on the camera icon in the lower-right corner or swiping to the left side of your lockscreen.)

Encrypt your device

It’s always a good practice to encrypt your personal information, but in the event that your phone is confiscated, stolen, or lost, you don’t want any information linking you or others to the protests to fall into the hands of authorities (or anyone else). So if you haven’t done so already, now’s a good time to secure your device and any information on it.

Now’s a good time to secure your device and any information on it

It’s a quick and easy process. If you have an Android phone, go to Settings > Security & Privacy> More security & privacy > Encryption & credentials > Encrypt phone. (As always, this may vary somewhat, depending on the phone’s manufacturer.)

For an iPhone, as long as you’ve set a passcode up and you see the text “Data protection is enabled” at the bottom of the Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode) page (which you’ll find in your Settings menu), your information is secure.

Turn on airplane mode

Your phone actually gives off a lot of information about you, including where you’ve been. And not only can those signals be intercepted, but they can also be used to locate you and connect you to others. So while you’re at a demonstration, you’ll want your phone to communicate as little information about you as possible.

Keep your phone off or put it in airplane mode, which turns off cellular data and Wi-Fi by default. This stops cell carriers from knowing where you are based on what cell towers you connected to. This will also protect against any stingray attacks, which is when a device pretends to be a cell tower and collects data, including location, from phones around it. Police have been accused of using stingrays, or cell-site simulators, to collect information about phones.

Airplane mode does not disable location services, so it’s a good idea to make sure all of those services are switched off. (On an Android, you can toggle it off at Settings > Location > Use location. On an iPhone, it’s Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Location Services.) If airplane mode interferes with your activities, then switch off cellular data, Bluetooth, location services, and Wi-Fi individually, and only switch on what you need.

Use guided access or pin your screens

Android and iOS both have features that let you access one app while effectively locking the rest of the phone, so you can use that app while keeping the device secure. This is a safer way to post to social media or take photos during a protest, and it’s helpful in the event that you need to show someone, including law enforcement, something on your phone.

The iOS feature is called Guided Access. To enable it, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle it on. Once it’s on, you’ll see additional settings such as setting the time limits for guided access and locking your display using a passcode. Enable the Accessibility Shortcut on the same page.

To use Guided Access, open the app you would like to use. Press the home button three times, which will lock down all the other apps on your phone. A pop-up will let you select Guided Access; you can then circle areas on the screen you would like to disable. When you’re ready, select Start in the upper-right corner and set a passcode. To disable Guided Access, press the home button three times, select Guided Access, then enter your passcode and tap End on the top-left corner of the next screen.

On Android, the process is called app pinning. Go to Settings > Security & privacy > More security & privacy > App pinning and toggle it on. You can set it so it will ask for your PIN before unpinning. To pin an app, swipe up (if you’re using gesture navigation) or press the square Overview key at the bottom of your screen (if you’re using button navigation) to see all your open apps. When you see the app you want to pin, long-press on the app’s icon at the top of its screen, and select Pin. (At that point, Android warns you that some personal data may be accessible and that the pinned app mayy open other apps.) To unpin it, either swipe up and hold or long-press the back and Overview keys.

Use secure apps

If you’re using your own phone, or even if you’re using a burner phone, it’s a good idea to use especially secure apps. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a list of recommended tools.

For texting, one of the apps that’s most often recommended is Signal, a secure, open-source, end-to-end encrypted messaging app that doesn’t store message metadata. If you’re communicating about protests and demonstrations, this is one of the safest ways to do so. For added safety, you can also take advantage of some of its more secure features by adjusting your privacy settings to, for example, set up a PIN or use call relays. It also has a handy disappearing message feature that causes every message sent in a conversation to disappear after a specific time limit.

If you’re using an Android phone, you may want to use a more secure browser than Chrome. Chief among them is Tor (also available for the iPhone), which protects your identity and information by bouncing your activity through a set of relays. Other security-minded browsers include Brave, which is aggressively anti-advertising, and Vivaldi, which has a number of privacy-enhancing tools. If you’ve got an iPhone, Apple controls the security of its Safari browser pretty strictly (although, in the past, there have been occasional blowups).

Finally, a search engine like DuckDuckGo won’t store your search history or connect it to your IP address.

Use a VPN

In or out of a demonstration, it’s always a good idea to download and set up a VPN on your phone. A VPN hides your activity by encrypting your connection. Also keep in mind that VPNs that charge a subscription fee are usually more trustworthy than free ones.

Secure your social media accounts

If you want to protect your identity and keep the history of your Bluesky, Threads, and other social media posts private, consider creating a separate email account that isn’t linked to any personal information. You can then use that to create separate social media accounts for protest or demonstration photos and footage.

It’s also always a good idea to have two-factor authentication set up on all of your accounts.

If you’re taking photos and videos

Try not to take any photos or videos with identifying information about others without their consent. Be mindful of objects in the photos, such as street signs and landmarks, that may give away the location if that’s something you want to hide. Afterward, blur out other demonstrators and scrub the photos of any metadata.

If your device is confiscated

Don’t unlock it, if at all possible. (As previously mentioned, your Fifth Amendment rights are covered if it’s locked using a PIN or password, but not if you can unlock it with a fingerprint or face image.) As soon as possible, change your passwords for any apps or accounts you have, and disconnect your accounts from that device.

After years of dealing with Joy-Con drift and no satisfactory answers from Nintendo, we may finally have our solution. A company called Gulikit created a set of Switch joystick replacements that promise to banish stick drift once and for all (via Gizmodo).

Take a look at these drift-free joystick replacements. Image: Gulikit

Unlike your standard Joy-Cons from Nintendo, Gulikit’s joystick replacements use something called Hall effect sensors to essentially make them drift-proof — the same technology used by Sega’s 90s-era Saturn 3D and Dreamcast controllers. As iFixit points out, the sensors use magnets to detect the joystick’s movement, which means none of the components actually rub up against each other and wear out like the sensors used on Joy-Cons do.

One of the reasons Joy-Cons drift in the first place is that they use potentiometers. This technology deteriorates over time, resulting in incorrect readings that make your controller seem like it’s possessed. In 2021, Nintendo executive Ko Shiota likened the problem to car tires that “wear out as the car moves, as they are in constant friction with the ground to rotate.”

That’s where Gulikit’s joysticks come in. The sticks, which are available for $29.70 on Amazon will presumably put an end to frequent Joy-Con replacements and repair orders (that should absolutely not be the case). You’ll have to install the replacement joysticks yourself, of course, but this video from iFixit should point you in the right direction when it comes to dismantling the Joy-Cons. Gulikit’s joysticks also come with a screwdriver, replacement screws, a tweezer, and a plastic pry tool to help you get started.

While we haven’t gotten the chance to try them for ourselves, users on Amazon have left mostly positive reviews. However, there are some saying they leave a small gap between the ring that’s supposed to prevent dust and other debris from getting inside the Switch, although it’s unclear how or if this will affect the sticks (or the Joy-Cons themselves). Gulikit also has replacement joysticks for the Steam Deck, as well as a full-blown KingKong 2 Pro controller with hall effect sensors.

Keep in mind that adding the third-party sticks could void the warranty on your Switch and Joy-Cons, but is still a potential solution if you’re fed up with stick drift. It’s just sad that — in the year 2023 — we have to go through all this just to get things to work properly when the technology’s already there, and has been there for decades.",Technology

The Nintendo Switch may be remembered as much for repopularizing portable gaming as it will for a hardware issue that affected millions of gamers: joystick drift.

Drifting is the most common term for an issue where joysticks detect false inputs — even when no one is touching a controller — causing unwanted movements to happen in a game. The issue also affects controllers from Sony, Microsoft, and third-party accessory makers.

Hall effect sensors emerged a few years ago as a potential solution to the problem, but there’s an even better option out there that’s easier to retrofit into existing controller designs. That solution is tunneling magnetoresistance, or TMR, a technology that revolutionized hard drives two decades ago using quantum mechanics and magnets.

Like Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors avoid the fundamental problem with more traditional joysticks: their sensors wear down as a matter of their design. The controllers that ship with the last few Xbox consoles, the PS4 and PS5, and the Switch are all built around sensors like this — potentiometers, a component that can be used to change or measure electrical resistance.

Solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity

As iFixit explained in 2021, inside the two potentiometers that are used to detect up-and-down and side-to-side movements in each joystick is a semicircular strip of carbon film with terminals at each end that pass an electrical current through it. As the joystick is moved, a component called a wiper slides back and forth along this strip, measuring the voltage where it makes contact. Since the voltage predictably changes across the length of the strip, the wiper’s voltage measurements can be used to accurately measure the movements of a joystick.

But solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity. That strip of carbon film inside a joystick’s potentiometer can wear down over time, affecting the flow of current and the accuracy of voltage measurements. Dirt on the film, either from moving components wearing down or dust and food crumbs finding their way inside a controller, can also contribute to inaccurate measurement and drift.

That’s why controller manufacturers are now turning to sensors that don’t rely on components rubbing together: Hall effect and TMR, both of which rely on magnetism instead. As iFixit explains, Hall effect joysticks replace resistive strips and wipers with magnets and sensors that never make contact, using a phenomenon first discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.

Inside a Hall effect sensor is a conductive material called a “Hall element” that has an electrical current flowing through it. Normally, electrons flow straight through this conductor, but the presence of a magnetic field can interfere and divert the electrons to either side, like an invisible obstacle diverting the flow of water in a stream. As the magnet attached to the joystick moves closer and farther away, the Hall effect sensor measures the resulting voltage changes in the conductor. Those measurements are translated into movements in a game with more accuracy and reliability than you get with potentiometers, and without any wear and tear.

Hall effect sensors have been in use for over 50 years — and were even used by Sega in the Saturn 3D and Dreamcast’s controllers that debuted in the mid-’90s. GuliKit repopularized the use of Hall effect sensors in gaming hardware after debuting a controller with it at E3 2021. But they’re still not widely used in gaming hardware because potentiometer-based joysticks are cheaper to manufacture. They also have higher power demands, which is something controller manufacturers need to account for.

What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself

The solution for that may be TMR sensors, which come out of more recent discoveries. In 1988, physicists Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg independently discovered a phenomenon called the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR), which earned them both the Nobel Prize for physics in 2007. They found that the presence of a magnetic field applied to ultra-thin films made up of a conductor — such as copper or aluminum just a few nanometers thick — sandwiched between two magnetic materials would affect the direction of spin of electrons and their ability to easily flow from one side of the film to the other.

“If you put two magnets right next to each other… very close to each other with a spacer material, if the magnets on this one have a spin A and the same spin is on the other one, it’s easy for the electrons to move to the next one. But if the other one has a misaligned spin… the electrons want to move, but there’s no easy way to move the other electrons as well, and that causes a change of resistance,” Riyan Mendonsa, senior staff engineer at Seagate, explained to The Verge.

TMR works in a very similar way to GMR. The presence of a magnetic field aligns the spin direction of electrons, making it easier for them to flow from one side to the other. But while GMR uses a conductive material sandwiched between two magnetic layers, TMR, counterintuitively, uses an insulating material that acts as a deliberate barrier.

To flow from one side of the film to the other, electrons rely on a quantum mechanical phenomenon called quantum tunneling to pass through that in-between insulator. The idea of particles passing through a barrier they shouldn’t be able to is not easy to wrap your head around, but it can happen when certain materials — such as aluminum or magnesium oxide — are just a few atoms thick. And thanks to physicists like Erwin Schrödinger, the phenomenon isn’t a complete mystery. We have equations that can accurately predict when it will occur.

What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself. It’s that adding and removing a magnetic field produces a measurable change in resistance. For years, hard drives relied on read heads with a design similar to the wire coils used in speakers and microphones, according to Mendonsa. In 2005, Seagate adopted TMR technology in read heads, which could not only be made much smaller but also were far more sensitive at detecting the presence of a magnetic field.

“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors.”

This allowed the magnetic bits on hard drives to also be made much smaller, dramatically increasing the density and storage capacities of 2.5-inch drives to 120GB. Various forms of TMR technology are expected to still be used in hard drive manufacturing for years to come.

Although the underlying science is different, Hall effect and TMR sensors can both be used to detect a joystick’s movements through the use of non-contact magnets, but TMR sensors have some key advantages.

“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors,” says Jack He, GuliKit’s business director. That could allow for the use of smaller magnets, making TMR joysticks easier to manufacture. But leveraging the higher sensitivity for improved joystick accuracy will depend on manufacturers and the hardware they use. “The resolution mainly depends on the sampling precision of the backend MCU, and is not closely related to the joystick itself,” says He.

Compared to Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors typically have lower power consumption, but the advantage there isn’t improved battery life. “The original design of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo game controllers uses traditional resistive film joystick technology with a constant power supply design, with a power capacity limited to about 1 mA,” He says. Hall sensors can consume anywhere from 0.5mA to up to 2mA of power, while TMR sensors only consume between 0.1mA and 0.3mA. This allows joysticks with TMR sensors to be installed on current controller hardware “as a perfect 1:1 replacement without any other circuit modifications.” That could help speed up adoption and bring down the price of the technology by simplifying manufacturing.

TMR sensors also offer more performance stability over a wider temperature range — an advantage that’s especially useful for a product often being gripped by warm hands for several hours.

But it will still be a few years for TMR technology to become mainstream in gaming hardware. “TMR sensors are often more expensive than traditional Hall effect sensors, especially in smaller volumes,” He points out. “However, as TMR technology matures, the cost difference is expected to decrease.”",Technology

Nintendo was expecting the Switch 2 would be just as successful as the original, and it’s already become the fastest-selling game console of all time after a strong launch. Nintendo revealed today that it has sold more than 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the console’s first four days, surpassing records for any of Nintendo’s hardware within the same launch period. But the record is more significant than that.

Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, points out on X that the Switch 2 is “the fastest selling home video game console of all time.” It took Sony 16 days to sell 2.1 million PS4 consoles, and six weeks to reach 4.2 million units. The Switch 2 has also comfortably beaten the PS5 launch, which debuted during the pandemic and associated chip supply constraints. It took seven weeks for Sony to sell-through 4.4 million PS5 units.

It’s clear that Nintendo was able to meet pent-up demand for a Switch successor by having ample inventory on hand in key markets. Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, but there was still some limited stock on launch day for those willing to line up at midnight or take a chance in the morning. The threat of price increases from tariffs likely helped goose initial demand, too.

While the Switch 2 isn’t the biggest UK console launch of all time and it seemed relatively easy for Brits to buy one on launch day, it’s still the fourth best-selling console in the UK according to data from NielsenIQ.

Analysts had widely predicted strong Switch 2 launch sales, despite a lack of launch titles for Nintendo’s latest console. Nintendo’s record-breaking Switch 2 sales are thanks to a lot of pent-up demand waiting on this new hardware, and Nintendo using that time to build enough units to meet demand.

The real question now is whether Nintendo can keep up this sales pace, and if tariffs and handheld alternatives could slow down sales. Nintendo is aiming to hit its goal of 15 million Switch 2 console sales by the end of March 2026, and it’s already off to a good start with 3.5 million in four days.

The original Switch launched in March 2017 and sold 17.79 million units in its first 13 months on sale — more than Nintendo’s own estimates at the time. The Switch has now sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, pushing it close to overtaking the DS as Nintendo’s best-selling console.",Technology

Actors have once again picked up their picket signs. But this time, members of the Screen Actors Guild are striking against the video game industry after negotiations for a new contract governing interactive media and video games fell through. The guild began striking on Friday, July 26th, preventing over 160,000 SAG-AFTRA members from taking new video game projects and impeding games already in development from the biggest publishers to the smallest indie studios.

Negotiations broke down due to disagreements over worker protections around AI. The actors union, SAG-AFTRA, negotiates the terms of the interactive media agreement, or IMA, with a bargaining committee of video game publishers, including Activision, Take-Two, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and others that represent a total of 30 signatory companies. Though SAG-AFTRA and the video game bargaining group were able to agree on a number of proposals, AI remained the final stumbling block resulting in the strike.

SAG-AFTRA’s provisions on AI govern both voice and movement performers with respect to digital replicas — or using an existing performance as the foundation to create new ones without the original performer — and the use of generative AI to create performances without any initial input. However, according to SAG-AFTRA, the bargaining companies disagreed about which type of performer should be eligible for AI protections.

SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said that the bargaining companies initially wanted to offer protections to voice, not motion performers. “So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers’ offer,” Rodriguez said in an interview with Aftermath.

Rodriguez said that the companies later extended protections to motion performers, but only if “the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica.”

SAG-AFTRA rejected this proposal as it would potentially exclude a majority of movement performances. “Their proposal would carve out anything that doesn’t look and sound identical to me,” said Andi Norris, a member of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee, during a press conference. “[The proposal] would leave movement specialists, including stunts, entirely out in the cold, to be replaced ... by soulless synthetic performers trained on our actual performances.”

The bargaining game companies argued that the terms went far enough and would require actors’ approval. “Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry,” wrote Audrey Cooling, a representative working on behalf of the video game companies on the bargaining committee in a statement to The Verge.

SAG-AFTRA’s strike rules include a number of exceptions for struck companies and work, which makes it difficult to know the true scope of the strike, especially the games it affects.

For example, work done under SAG-AFTRA’s Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement is exempt from the strike. Additionally, a specific clause in the IMA called “side letter six” grants an exemption to games in production before August 2023. This means that though Take-Two is a struck company, Grand Theft Auto VI is not considered struck work. However, members of SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee have encouraged others to refrain from working on side letter six games.

“Side letter six permits but does not require performers to render services during a strike,” said Sarah Elmaleh, a video game performer and chair of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee in a TikTok video. “This language made its way into our contract for one reason only, to undermine our union’s most valuable tool: a strike.”

The last SAG-AFTRA video game strike was in 2016 and lasted 11 months, earning performers fixed rate increases, improved safety assurances on set, and better oversight to prevent vocal stress in voice performers.",Technology

He is also a regular contributor to the radio program Science Friday. Prior to Vox, he was a reporter for ClimateWire at E&E News.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday killed President Obama’s signature climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan (CPP). It’s one of the few definitive wins in the Trump administration’s full-court press to undo and weaken environmental regulations.

Speaking before an audience that included coal miners wearing reflective shirts and hard hats, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler criticized the Obama policy, which required states to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and aimed to reduce US power sector emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

“The CPP would have asked low- and middle-income Americans to bear the costs of the previous administration’s climate plan,” Wheeler said. “One analysis predicted double-digit electricity price increases in 40 states under the CPP.”

The EPA is still required to regulate greenhouse gases, but the CPP’s new replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, is drastically weaker. The ACE rule would lower power sector emissions by 11 million tons by 2030, or between 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent. The EPA noted that long-term industry trends are expected to still push emissions down 35 percent, but that’s largely independent of the ACE rule.

Speaking at the announcement, White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday that US emissions are “flat or down.” That is wrong. In fact, US greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise after years of decline.

So the new ACE rule is likely to do little to slow the US power sector’s impact on the global climate. According to some researchers, the new policy itself could actually increase greenhouse gas emissions, even compared to business as usual. And according to the EPA’s own assessments last year, the proposal will lead to thousands more deaths from air pollution.

However, environmental groups are gearing up to file legal challenges to the ACE rule. And despite its intentions, the new regulation would do little to slow the decline of the US coal industry.

The EPA is required to regulate greenhouse gases, but the law doesn’t say it has to be enthusiastic about it

As much as the Trump administration doesn’t want to do it, the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency has to limit greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if they’re a threat to public health. The EPA’s 2009 endangerment finding for carbon dioxide determined just that.

So the Trump administration couldn’t just repeal the CPP; it needed a plausible replacement to fight climate change. The ACE rule is an attempt at that.

“I believe this is the first rule in EPA’s history that acknowledges the existential threat of climate change but by the agency’s own admission does absolutely nothing to stop it,” said former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in a statement.

The critical detail here is how the ACE rule intends to lower emissions compared to the CPP. The EPA is required to lay out a standard known as “best system of emission reduction.” Under the Obama administration, this included pricing carbon dioxide, switching to cleaner power generation fuels, or capturing carbon dioxide emissions.

The new ACE rule leans on one method: efficiency. The technical term is “heat rate improvement,” and it means is that fossil fuel-burning power plants would be pushed to draw more energy from the same amount of fuel. This would lower the carbon intensity of the energy generated.

However, generating more energy from the same amount of fuel makes the fuel more cost-effective. That in turn could lead to a rebound effect where utilities end up burning more fuels like coal and natural gas. According to a study published in April in Environmental Research Letters, the ACE rule would lead to 28 percent of the power plants modeled in the study to emit more carbon dioxide by 2030 compared to a scenario with no policy at all.

This rebound effect can also lead to an increase of other air pollutants like particulates, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. In the EPA’s own regulatory impact assessment for the ACE rule published last year, the agency noted that these extra pollutants could cause between 460 and 1,400 additional deaths per year by 2030, in addition to exacerbating other ailments like asthma.

The ACE rule is part of a concerted, and largely futile, strategy across the Trump administration to boost coal

President Trump has made no secret of his love of fossil fuels in general and coal in particular. His Administration has gone to extreme lengths to boost the sector, from opening up unprecedented amounts of public land to mining to trying to use emergency powers to bail out money-losing coal plants.

The EPA is also working to relax Mercury and Air Toxics Standards that limit hazardous pollution from existing coal-fired power plants. For new coal-fired generators, the EPA is working to relax New Source Performance Standards that govern how much carbon dioxide new power plants are allowed to emit.

The EPA is justifying these changes by arguing that the costs of implementing new environmental controls like scrubbers for flue gases is too high. The agency is also changing how it calculates the benefits of limiting emissions, proposing a shift to a model that yields far fewer saved lives and health benefits.

Scientists on EPA advisory boards who received research grants from the agency have also been forced out of their positions. EPA officials said this was a move to prevent conflicts of interest, but the agency has allowed scientists from industries regulated by the EPA as well as researchers from states that have sued the EPA to continue advising it.

Trump’s EPA has also taken steps to restrict the scientific research it uses to form regulations, arguing that all research that informs rulemaking should be reproducible and make underlying data public. Health advocates say that this would exclude important research on one-off events like chemical leaks, and patient privacy concerns prevent some researchers from releasing their underlying work.

The net result of these changes is a suite of policies that make it easier to keep existing coal power plants online and clear the path for any new plants.

But it’s not regulations that are driving out the coal industry in the United States; it’s competition, especially from natural gas.

So it’s unlikely that these new rules would move the needle for the coal industry, and more coal-fired power plants are slated to be closed this year.

The Affordable Clean Energy rule obviates one legal headache for the EPA, but is creating another one

Trump’s EPA has argued that the Obama plan exceeded the agency’s authority and that the new proposal fits within the confines of the law. When the CPP was announced, 27 states sued to block it. Then, in an unusual move, the Supreme Court in 2016 ruled 5-4 to stay the Clean Power Plan to allow state lawsuits to proceed, preventing it from ever going into effect.

With the Affordable Clean Energy rule finalized, those lawsuits are now moot.

The latest repeal is at the intersection of two Trump Administration priorities outlined in executive orders: to roll back regulations and to promote US energy development, particularly fossil fuels. And unlike other environmental rollbacks at the EPA that have been delayed, bogged down in bureaucratic muck, or stalled by lawsuits, the ACE rule, now that it has been finalized, might stick.

But New York Attorney General Letitia James has already announced her intent to sue the Trump administration over the ACE rule and expects other states to join the litigation. Other state attorneys general have also come out to oppose the Trump administration’s new power plant rule. That means another wave of court cases could stall the EPA’s new rule.",Science

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules for power plants today that are supposed to clean up pollution. But instead of encouraging more renewable energy growth, the proposal would actually help keep polluting coal and gas plants online.

The proposed mandate requires existing power plants to start limiting their carbon dioxide emissions in 2030, introducing restrictions that would become more stringent over time. Any new gas power plants would have to comply with pollution caps as soon as they’re built. A fact sheet from the agency says it decided not to update rules for new coal plants since it doesn’t anticipate new coal facilities to come online, which are more expensive and polluting than gas plants.

The proposed rules don’t take the most effective route: pushing utilities to quickly retire coal and gas plants in favor of renewable sources like wind and solar energy. Instead, they push existing plants to adopt systems that rely heavily on controversial technology to capture CO2 emissions. That risks prolonging the US’s dependence on fossil fuels and saddling Americans with all the other pollution that power plants generate.

Instead of encouraging more renewable energy growth, the proposal would actually help keep polluting coal and gas plants online

Carbon capture technologies scrub a portion of CO2 out of smokestack emissions. So they can help coal and gas-fired plants meet the EPA’s new caps on greenhouse gas emissions that otherwise wouldn’t have been able to do so. On a press call yesterday, EPA administrator Michael Regan said the rules would “require ambitious reductions in carbon pollution based on proven and cost-effective control technologies.”

But the strategy fails to tackle all the pollution that comes from running the power grid on fossil fuels. The devices might be able to capture up to 90 percent of a plant’s CO2 emissions, but they leave other sources of pollution unaddressed. For instance, gas infrastructure — from wells to pipelines and appliances — routinely leaks methane, a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. Taking these kinds of supply chain emissions into account, Stanford research found that carbon capture tech might only clean up roughly 10 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions a power plant is responsible for over 20 years. Neighborhoods near power plants are also saddled with particulate matter and other air pollutants, a problem disproportionately affecting communities of color.

Nevertheless, the EPA believes its plan will slash 617 million metric tons of CO2 through 2042, equivalent to axing annual emissions from half the cars on the road in the United States. It also claims that the net climate and health benefits from its proposed emissions rule could reach $64 to $85 billion between 2024 and 2042.

The EPA’s new policy is sure to face legal challenges. The Obama administration proposed its own plan to clean up greenhouse gas emissions from power plants back in 2015 that got tied up in courts before the Trump administration replaced it with its own, weaker rule. A federal court subsequently blocked implementation of the Trump administration’s rule, which the Biden administration is now attempting to repeal and replace with the proposal laid out today.

To make things even dicier for the Biden administration, the Supreme Court recently gutted a major policy tool that could limit the EPA’s authority over power plant operations. Its decision on West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency last June essentially said that the agency can try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but not in a way that determines what sources of energy the US uses. That decision made it more likely that the EPA would have to lean into carbon capture in its strategy.

Even before this ruling, the Biden administration was eager to give carbon capture technologies a boost. The Inflation Reduction Act increases tax credits for carbon capture by 70 percent, which could make it more financially feasible for utilities. But it’s hard to predict whether power plants will be able to afford carbon capture technologies — and whether power companies will pass those costs on to consumers.

So far, only one power plant has been paired with carbon capture in the US, and it could only afford to stay online for a few years before suspending operations in 2020. The US Department of Energy (DOE) burned through $684 million on that carbon capture project and five similar plans for coal plants that never got off the ground primarily because of “factors affecting their economic viability,” according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office.

Deploying expensive carbon capture devices could saddle consumers with higher electricity bills, according to research published earlier this year based on data from Australia. The cost of electricity from power plants outfitted with carbon capture devices is at least 1.5 to 2 times more expensive than solar, wind, or traditional gas and coal, according to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

As part of the Paris climate agreement, the Biden administration has pledged to cut the US’s greenhouse gas emissions in half from peak levels by 2030. The power sector accounts for a quarter of that pollution, but it’s unclear how much the EPA’s plan can help meet that deadline since mandates for existing power plants wouldn’t be enforced until 2030. Fossil fuel emissions to date have already triggered more extreme storms, droughts, heatwaves, and other climate-related disasters.

Cleaning up the electricity grid is also crucial for getting rid of pollution from transportation. Last month, the EPA announced ambitious new standards for tailpipe emissions, aiming to make more than two-thirds of car sales electric by 2032. But Biden’s policies could let the grid powering those electric cars keep polluting, undercutting his overall climate goals.

The EPA’s proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days after it’s posted in the Federal Register today.",Science

https://variety.com/2025/film/news/f1-apple-movie-strategy-tim-cook-lewis-hamilton-1236424270/,"Tim Cook and Lewis Hamilton are on top of the world. Or so it seems, as the CEO of Apple and the Formula 1 racing superstar stand on the deck of Apple Park’s observatory in Cupertino, California.

This high perch is the last stop on a tour of the 175-acre Apple Park campus that Cook is giving Hamilton on a sunny day in late April. It’s Hamilton’s first visit, despite having been in business with Apple since 2022 as a producer on “F1 the Movie” the $200 million-plus action movie from Apple Original Films that stars Brad Pitt and arrives in multiplexes on June 27.

Apple and Hamilton are enormously invested in the film, and both have a lot to prove with its performance at the global box office. There’s no margin for error: “F1” will either soar to become one of the year’s biggest hits, or it will be considered a costly disappointment. It’s a high-stakes gamble on the world stage — the kind of “Let’s go for it!” risk that builds bonds between executives and creatives.

On this breezy afternoon, however, the film’s opening-weekend reckoning is still eight weeks away, and there’s much work to be done to sell the movie to the masses. But in this moment, Cook wants to show off the breathtaking view to his starry guest.

“Is that San Jose?” Hamilton asks, pointing off in the distance at the dim outline of boxy office buildings. Cook, 64, nods, and the two survey the land all around them. It’s a quiet moment both seem to enjoy as they contemplate what each has riding on the release of “F1.”

Hamilton, 40, is a seven-time Formula 1 champion, one of the winningest race car drivers of all time and a trailblazer for inclusivity in sports and other fields. The U.K.-born prodigy who began racing at age 8 is also an entrepreneur, part owner of the Denver Broncos and a style icon with a growing apparel business called Plus44. Though Hamilton has traveled the world at 200 miles per hour, even he’s impressed by the rarefied air of Apple Park and the view he’s taking in overlooking Silicon Valley.

Not only is Hamilton about to celebrate the release of his first major film as a producer, but he’s still busy competing in the 2025 season of Formula 1, which began in March and ends in December. If Formula 1 devotees and fellow drivers don’t like the film, Hamilton will surely feel it on tour. He’s anything but worried: “If you look at previous racing movies,” he says, “it’s very hard to create the authentic racing feel. This is the best racing movie that’s ever been made.”

Cook, meanwhile, is marshaling considerable resources to support what is the splashiest movie-launch campaign in Apple’s short history of producing. The film, spearheaded by “Top Gun: Maverick” writer-director Joseph Kosinski, included a year’s worth of development on advanced camera technology to capture the sheer force of auto racing. Cook emphasizes that that same tech is baked into the camera of the latest iPhone model.

“F1” hails from Apple Original Films, Pitt’s Plan B, Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Hamilton’s Dawn Apollo banner. Warner Bros. is handling worldwide theatrical distribution. Hamilton and Apple have also teamed up for a feature-length documentary on his life that is expected to have a limited theatrical run. And there’s speculation that Apple may be a contender for U.S. TV rights to Formula 1 when the league’s current deal is up, starting with the 2026 season. Simply put, Apple is deeply invested in “F1.”

Weeks before tracking reports emerge to indicate “F1” is indeed highly anticipated by moviegoers, Cook asserts that he is confident the movie is worthy of the Apple brand. “You can feel that you’re in the car with the camera,” he says. “We cared about every detail.”

“F1” marks a big milestone for Apple in its expansion over the past half-dozen years of making movies and TV shows. Apple is banking on Kosinski and the team behind 2022’s hit “Top Gun: Maverick” to deliver a four-quadrant smash that will be measured as much for its impact on pop culture and filmmaking as it will be in box office receipts. In a best-case scenario, “F1” becomes the kind of sensation that launches a million memes and is the engine that accelerates the popularity of Formula 1 racing in the U.S. once and for all.

“F1” has been a passion project for Eddy Cue, the architect of Apple’s expansion into producing movies and TV shows. He’s an Apple veteran and racing buff who sits on the board of directors of Ferrari, Hamilton’s racing team. His dreams for the film are loftier even than a nine-figure opening weekend: “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” says Cue.

In Cook’s view, “F1” is the perfect vehicle to test Apple’s power to affect culture with the soft power of a broad-appeal movie rather than through the hardware of its computers and smartphones.

“To bring something to life that would be authentic to the sport, that would tell a great story as well about the ups and downs of life — ‘F1’ hit on all the things,” Cook says. “And then we could bring some things that are uniquely Apple to the movie, like our camera technology. And we plan to have the whole of the company support it as well — our retail operation and everything. So it was something that we could get the entire company around. It feels wonderful to be a part of it.”

Kosinski felt the Apple touch throughout the making of the movie. With Apple’s support and Hamilton’s connections, Kosinski was permitted to film “F1” at numerous Grand Prix races during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. The movie’s racing production crew became the unofficial 11th team on the circuit, complete with its own paddock in the heart of the action in order to better capture racing sequences.

At times, Kosinski had as many as 28 cameras running simultaneously at key events. It added up to more than 5,000 hours when the flag came down on the 2024 season.

“The world of F1 is about pushing boundaries technologically — it’s embedded in the sport,” Kosinski says. “It meshed well with the whole Apple vibe.” He adds that the film “ended up being an incredible partnership between two giant brands. It was needed to pull this off.”

Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer behind “Top Gun,” “Flashdance,” “Beverly Hills Cop” and “CSI,” agrees. “This was an enormous production,” he says. “I’ve never seen a company throw everything they had at a movie like this.”

As befitting a company that measures its market cap in trillion-dollar increments ($3.1 trillion as of June 2), Apple’s bar for success is high. Steve Jobs, the company’s late co-founder and Cook’s

predecessor as CEO, established early on that the Apple brand was something to be revered and protected. Jobs was light-years ahead of the pack in understanding the immense value for a tech firm of building a titanium-strength consumer brand that is synonymous with innovation, creativity and coolness. The apple-shaped logo and what it stands for in the minds of consumers is an incalculable part of that $3 trillion valuation.

Like Cue, Cook has a clear vision for what Apple TV+ and Apple Original Films bring to the company. “We stand at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts,” Cook says. “We wanted Apple TV+ to be a place where great storytellers

would tell their best stories.”

Apple TV+ opened for business in November 2019. Cue and Cook both observe that 2025 marks the first time in the service’s history that it will roll out a carefully planned full-year slate without the extra burden of managing around a global pandemic or the two strikes in 2023 that blew a six-month hole in production pipelines. “I finally feel like we’re at the point where our slate hasn’t been impacted by the strikes or by COVID,” Cue says.

Apple could have easily M&A’d its way into the industry, buying a major studio or entertainment library. The company, which has $30 billion in cash reserves, can certainly afford to write the kind of big check that could make a deal happen overnight. But build rather than buy has been the Apple ethos ever since Jobs and co-founder Steve Wozniak were laboring in their garage in the mid-1970s.

“We elected not to go out and procure a catalog. I know that’s a faster way into the business, but it didn’t feel like Apple at the end of the day,” Cook says. “Apple should have something that we pour our passion into, and that’s exactly what we’re doing with the shows. And now you can see us hitting a stride. It feels wonderful.”

In conversation, Cook speaks slowly and softly, with a Southern lilt that reflects his Alabama roots. He’s thoughtful and methodical in answering questions in a voice that is both calming and authoritative.

When pressed about what Apple’s investments in movies and TV shows have meant for the company as a whole, Cook explains that Apple is at heart “a toolmaker,” delivering computers and other devices that enable creativity in users. (This vision for the company, and the “toolmaker” term specifically, was first articulated by Jobs in the early 1980s.) “We’re a toolmaker,” Cook says again. “We make tools for creative people to empower them to do things they couldn’t do before. So we were doing lots of business with Hollywood well before we were in the TV business.

“We studied it for years before we decided to do [Apple TV+]. I know there’s a lot of different views out there about why we’re into it. We’re into it to tell great stories, and we want it to be a great business as well. That’s why we’re into it, just plain and simple.”

Indeed, Apple has faced questions from Wall Street about the larger strategy around its investment in movies and TV. The company, unlike most other streamers, doesn’t disclose how many Apple TV+ subscribers it has signed up; nor does it break out financial results for the service, which it lumps in with its “Services” segment, along with revenue from music, games, the App Store and more.

Media analysts and observers have wondered how the content side of Apple threads together with the hardware sales that fuel the core business. As Cook sees it, that’s not the point, although such connections are emerging organically in the course of doing business, as evidenced by “F1” and the camera tech. “I don’t have it in my mind that I’m going to sell more iPhones because of it,” Cook says. “I don’t think about that at all. I think about it as a business. And just like we leverage the best of Apple across iPhones and across our services, we try to leverage the best of Apple TV+.”

Since Donald Trump took office in January, Apple has faced a new business threat from the administration’s campaign to enact steep tariffs on imported goods — and iPhones specifically.

Cook said on Apple’s May 1 earnings call that Trump’s tariffs would add $900 million in costs in the June quarter. He said that predicting the effect past then would be very difficult, given the uncertainty of the situation. That came after Cook announced in February that Apple would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, a pledge Trump proudly heralded.

Apple certainly didn’t need to charge into the volatile world of show business. But a decade ago, with the streaming wars and the Peak TV expansion boom on the horizon, Cue sensed opportunity. “We’ve always thought that art was a big piece of the DNA of who we are,” he says. “But we never expected to be creating movies or TV shows.” Yet as streaming platforms proliferated, “we saw that the world was changing, and it seemed like everybody was going after quantity. We thought there was an opening for us, if we really focused on high quality,” he says.

Cue is the ultimate Silicon Valley insider, having been with Apple since 1989. This was during the bad old days, after Jobs had been elbowed out of his own company in 1985.

By 1997, a debt-laden Apple barely escaped having to file for bankruptcy. Jobs returned as CEO in a rescue mission later that year. Three years later, Apple would be reborn, starting out on its 2001-10 run of unleashing world-shaking devices and services including the iPod, iPhone, iPad and iTunes. Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, had the formidable challenge of stepping into the top leadership role after Jobs died in 2011.

Cue was the natural choice to lead Apple’s entertainment push. The executive got his start at Apple leading software engineering and customer support teams. He rose to the senior ranks after playing an instrumental role in launching crucial businesses that supported Apple’s main business of selling phones, computers and tablets. He helped create Apple’s first online store in 1998. That was followed by the Herculean job of negotiating with the largest music labels to launch the pay-per-download iTunes Music Store in 2003. In 2008, Cue steered the launch of Apple’s App Store.

In hindsight, iTunes and the App Store were steppingstones for Apple to move squarely into the world of media and entertainment. More so than Silicon Valley neighbors like Google and Facebook, Apple has put its money and its reputation on the line to produce TV series and big-budget movies like 2023’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Martin Scorsese’s $200 million, three-and-a-half-hour period epic.

It took Cue two years of scouting and seeking recommendations from entertainment industry veterans to find the right leaders for Apple’s move into Hollywood. In 2017, Apple enlisted Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht as heads of Apple Worldwide Video, encompassing all TV and film activity for the company. At the time, Van Amburg and Erlicht were co-heads of Sony Pictures Television and were riding high on the much-lauded AMC Network drama series “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.”

Two years later, the Apple TV+ streaming platform debuted, as did Disney+. Disney had “The Mandalorian,” which commanded attention from the start, and Apple had “The Morning Show,” with Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Billy Crudup. Nine months after launch, in the teeth of the pandemic, Apple TV+ fielded a worldwide success with the feel-good vibes of Jason Sudeikis in “Ted Lasso” in August 2020.

The service’s run of late — Seth Rogen’s “The Studio,” Jon Hamm-starrer “Your Friends and Neighbors,” Season 2 of “Severance,” Jason Segel and Harrison Ford in “Shrinking,” Gary Oldman in “Slow Horses,” Cate Blanchett in “Disclaimer,” Kristen Wiig and Carol Burnett in “Palm Royale,” Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Connelly in “Dark Matter” — has been particularly strong. Like the smooth blond wood and sanded white marble in the buildings at Apple Park, the list of A-listers doing business with Apple goes on forever.

“We’ve worked five and a half years to become an overnight success,” Van Amburg jokes.

Ben Stiller, executive producer of “Severance,” credits Van Amburg, Erlicht and Cue for establishing a nurturing and close-knit environment for creatives to work in. “They’re very open to the back and forth that comes with the creative process,” he says. “It feels very familial. They really care about what they’re making, and they reach out on a personal level.”

The film side for Apple, headed by Matt Dentler, has been a slower build amid the strain of pandemic shutdowns. Last year, Apple did a last-minute about-face on plans for a wide theatrical release of “Wolfs,” starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, in part because of tepid reviews. That move spurred questions about the company’s commitment to theatrical exhibition for its films.

Erlicht says the campaign around “F1” will put that chatter to rest. He emphasizes that the film is designed to deliver what exhibitors say they want most: movies with broad appeal. In the spirit of “Top Gun,” “F1” hinges on a heart-tugging redemption story for Pitt’s character, Sonny Hayes. Hayes was tailor-made for Pitt and crafted to be seen on the biggest of screens.

“Just because something is unapologetically commercial, which ‘F1’ is, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t achieve the highest level of quality in that process,” Erlicht says. “The film achieves everything you could hope for in a pure adrenaline racing film. And we have incredible characters with relatable human emotions. That was a critical component. This is a film that really speaks to our belief in the film industry.”

The investment in time and technology to deliver “F1” paid off in the look and feel of the film. The movie straddles a wiggly line between an original concept and a franchise vehicle with the level of Formula 1 access that is baked into every frame – thanks to Hamilton’s commitment to making an eye-popping picture, Van Amburg says.

Helmer Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda, also a “Top Gun: Maverick” alum, brought the right mix directorial finesse and emotional drama to the table, he adds.

Kosinski’s “technical prowess and innovation is only matched by his skill as director telling human stories of vulnerability and honesty,” Van Amburg says. “I’d say ‘F1’ is as close to big global IP as it comes. So as much as I’d say it’s a completely original film, we’re going into it with a tremendous partner. We had a garage on pit lane between Mercedes and Ferrari, and you had Brad Pitt and Damson Idris out on the grid doing qualifying laps and out there racing. So we had unparalleled access and a tremendous supporter.”

For Erlicht and Van Amburg, the confluence of “F1” arriving at a time when Apple TV+’s original series slate is also feels like a validation of all the sweat equity that Apple’s leadership has invested across the board since they decided to go for it with original content.

“Now we’ve got this rhythm,” Van Amburg says. “We can put new things out every single week. We have a couple thousand hours of originals and over 300 titles that you can engage with. We have more returning series that we’ve ever had. We have sequels to movies that were big successes for us. So we’ve never felt better.”

In 2018, when Lewis Hamilton learned that Tom Cruise and Joseph Kosinksi were working on a follow-up to 1986’s “Top Gun,” he reached out to Cruise for Kosinski’s contact info. Hamilton sent the director a letter expressing his interest in a supporting role in the film. The two discussed the possibility of Hamilton taking on the character of Lt. Mickey “Fanboy” Garcia.

But in time it became apparent that Hamilton couldn’t shoot the film in California and keep his day job as a Formula 1 driver. So racing won out (and the role went to actor Danny Ramirez).

Hamilton is candid about the fact that he’s coming to a crossroads in his professional life. Racing is mostly a young person’s game. But Hamilton, who has 39 million-plus Instagram followers, will have no shortage of opportunities when he does retire from the track. (Just last month, his profile in the fashion industry got a huge boost when he co-chaired the Met Gala with Anna Wintour.) Being a player in the world of TV and film is one of them.

“At some point, I have to stop racing,” he says. “I really, really love film, and I’m really, really excited about building Dawn Apollo and bringing in the right people. To have a partner like Apple supporting me through that process? There’s no greater partner that I could have chosen to work with.”

But it was Kosinski who reached out to Hamilton a few years after their “Maverick” exchange, when the director set his sights on making “F1.” He’d become fascinated with the sport after binge-watching episodes of Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” during the pandemic.

Kosinski, Hamilton and Bruckheimer had a meeting at San Vicente Bungalows in West Hollywood to discuss a movie that would deliver unprecedented visuals and a crowd-pleasing story with a bona fide movie star in Pitt. Hamilton then used every ounce of goodwill that he had with the league to get access for the film team. Hamilton and other Formula 1 drivers make brief appearances as themselves in the movie.

“Lewis said to me in the beginning, ‘I’ve never seen footage in film that captures what it’s like to drive in one of these cars,’” Kosinski says. “That’s the challenge he gave me.”

That was three years ago. As Cook and Hamilton talk up the movie’s prospects at Apple Park, it’s evident that the comfort and safety of the campus is a world apart from rough-and-tumble auto racing. It’s also far removed from heartland America, where the enthusiasm of moviegoers for “F1” will likely determine how long it stays in theaters. Cook and Cue know that the movie’s performance will be closely scrutinized because of the Apple logo out front.

Like Hamilton behind the wheel, Cook believes strongly that the road to success is to focus on achieving the exceptional. Apple products have to be great, not just good. The movie business is no different.

“We really only do a few things. We only have a few products for the size of company we are. We pour all of ourselves in each one of those — and we do TV and movies the same way,” Cook says. “It’s about staying true to what Apple has always been. It’s about staying true to innovation, staying true to our North Star. And if you’re able to do that and entertain people in a great way, then we’re doing pretty good,” he says.

He adds, “I think the business of our being in this business will be good for us.”

In March, Apple delayed its upgraded Siri, saying that “it’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver” the promised features. At WWDC this week, Apple’s SVP of software Craig Federighi and SVP of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak shared more details about the decision to delay in an interview with The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern.

As part of its initial Apple Intelligence announcements at WWDC 2024, Apple said that the improved Siri would have awareness of your personal context and the ability to take actions for you in apps. While Apple was showing real software at that show, Siri “didn’t converge in the way, quality-wise, that we needed it to,” Federighi said. Apple wanted it to be “really, really reliable. And we weren’t able to achieve the reliability in the time we thought.”

“Look, we don’t want to disappoint customers,” Joswiak said. “We never do. But it would’ve been more disappointing to ship something that didn’t hit our quality standard, that had an error rate that we felt was unacceptable. So we made what we thought was the best decision. I’d make it again.”

Stern asked why Apple, with all of its resources, couldn’t make it work. “When it comes to automating capabilities on devices in a reliable way, no one’s doing it really well right now,” Federighi said. “We wanted to be the first. We wanted to do it best.” While the company had “very promising early results and working initial versions,” the team came to feel that “this just doesn’t work reliably enough to be an Apple product,” he said.",Technology

Apple is introducing a suite of updated child safety features, including one that will give parents more control over who their kids can communicate with. The features are set to arrive with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26, and tvOS 26, which will launch this fall.

Children will now be required to get parental approval when they want to communicate with a new phone number. Requests will appear in the Messages app, and parents can tap a button to approve or decline. Apple is also launching a “PermissionKit” that will let developers fold a similar feature into their apps so that kids can “send requests to their parents to chat, follow, or friend users.”

The company’s parental controls automatically enforce protections such as web content filters and app restrictions for kids under 13, and Apple will enable “similar age-appropriate protections” for kids between the ages of 13 and 17. Apple’s Communication Safety tool is being updated to “intervene” when it detects nudity in FaceTime calls and to blur nudity in shared albums in the Photos app, the company says. App Store age ratings will also expand to include more granular categories, including 13 plus, 16 plus, and 18 plus.

Additionally, Apple will let parents share a child’s age range with apps, the company says, without disclosing their specific date of birth. Developers can request age range information with a new “Declared Age Range API.”

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/climate-website-shut-down-noaa,"A major US government website supporting public education on climate science looks likely to be shuttered after almost all of its staff were fired, the Guardian has learned.

Climate.gov, the gateway website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa)’s Climate Program Office, will imminently no longer publish new content, according to multiple former staff responsible for the site’s content whose contracts were recently terminated.

“The entire content production staff at climate.gov (including me) were let go from our government contract on 31 May,” said a former government contractor who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “We were told that our positions within the contract were being eliminated.”

Rebecca Lindsey, the website’s former program manager, who was fired in February as part of the government’s purge of probationary employees, described a months-long situation within Noaa where political appointees and career staff argued over the fate of the website.

“I had gotten a stellar performance review, gotten a bonus, gotten a raise. I was performing very well. And then I was part of that group who got the form letter saying, ‘Your knowledge, skills, and abilities are no longer of use to Noaa’ – or something to that effect.”

Lindsey said she had been worried that climate.gov might be a target of the new administration soon after the election, but when a large Noaa contract was up for renewal at the end of May, her former boss told her that a demand came “from above” to rewrite parts of the contract to remove the team’s funding.

“It was a very deliberate, targeted attack,” said Lindsey.

Lindsey said the content for climate.gov was created and maintained by a contracted staff of about 10, with additional contributions from Noaa scientists, and its editorial content was specifically designed to be politically neutral, and faithful to the current state of the sciences. All of those staff have now been dismissed, she said.

“We operated exactly how you would want an independent, non-partisan communications group to operate,” said Lindsey, and noted that climate.gov is housed within the science division of Noaa, not its public affairs division. “It does seem to be part of this sort of slow and quiet way of trying to keep science agencies from providing information to the American public about climate.”

Noaa has been contacted for comment. It is unclear whether the website will remain visible to the public.

The climate.gov site was housed within the communication, education, and engagement division of Noaa, which describes itself as “the largest team in the federal government dedicated to climate communication, education, and engagement”.

The website receives hundreds of thousands of visits per month and is one of the most popular sources of information about climate science on the internet.

The fired staff believe the changes to climate.gov were targeted by political appointees within the Trump administration and specifically aimed at restricting public-facing climate information.

“It’s targeted, I think it’s clear,” said Tom Di Liberto, a former Noaa spokesperson who was also fired from his position earlier this year. “They only fired a handful of people, and it just so happened to be the entire content team for climate.gov. I mean, that’s a clear signal.”

The purge spared two web developers, which Di Liberto says is a concerning sign.

The contractor said: “My bigger worry, long-term, is I would hate to see it turn into a propaganda website for this administration, because that’s not at all what it was.”

The contractor said that while there will still be some pre-written, scheduled content posted on the site this month, there are no plans for further new content: “After that, we have no idea what will happen to the website.”

Lindsey said she also feared a “sinister possibility” that the administration may co-opt climate.gov to publish its own anti-science content. Lindsey said the administration could now “provide a content team from the Heartland Institute, leveraging our audience, our brand, our millions of people that we reach on social media every month. That’s the worst-case scenario.”

“Climate.gov is one heck of a URL. If you wanted to basically keep the website alive to do something with later, this is what you would do if you’re the [Trump] administration,” said Di Liberto. “It’s clear that the administration does not accept climate science, so it’s certainly concerning.”

The cuts also mean that there is now also no one left to run climate.gov social media accounts, which have hundreds of thousands of followers. Since staff in charge of climate.gov did a lot of pushback on misinformation, their absence may help anti-science information flourish there more readily.

“We were an extremely well-trusted source for climate information, misinformation and disinformation because we actually, legitimately would answer misinformation questions,” said the contractor. “We’d answer reader emails and try to combat disinformation on social media.

“We get attacked on social media by people who don’t believe in climate change, and that’s increased over the last six months or so as well.”

The shutdown comes amid broader cuts to science funding across the government, including “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within Noaa”, as stated in the 2026 “passback” budget Congress is currently deliberating.

“It seems like if they can’t get rid of all the research, what they can do is make it impossible for anyone to know about it,” said Di Liberto.

The contractor said they worry that what may have begun as a heavy-handed attempt by administration officials to limit public knowledge of human-caused climate change will have broader impacts on public education on the cyclical drivers of weather – as well as the results of publicly funded research conducted by Noaa scientists.

“To me, climate is more broad than just climate change. It’s also climate patterns like El Niño and La Niña. Halting factual climate information is a disservice to the public. Hiding the impacts of climate change won’t stop it from happening, it will just make us far less prepared when it does.”",Science

After farmers filed suit, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has agreed to restore climate information to webpages it took down soon after President Donald Trump took office this year.

The US Department of Justice filed a letter late last night on behalf of the USDA that says the agency “will restore the climate-change-related web content that was removed post-inauguration, including all USDA webpages and interactive tools” that were named in the plaintiffs’ complaint. It says the work is already “underway” and should be mostly done in about two weeks.

“We’re ecstatic.”

“I’ll be real frank, it feels good to win one, right? Farmers have been so put upon by the actions of this administration that, you know, it feels good to be able to say, we have something for you. This is back. You can rely on these resources,” says Marcie Craig, executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York. “We’re ecstatic.”

The group filed suit in February alongside two environmental organizations, alleging that the USDA threatened organic farmers’ livelihoods by removing information they relied on to help them make decisions about planting crops and managing their land — key resources as climate change leads to more unpredictable and extreme weather.

One of the resources removed by the USDA is an online tool called the “Climate Risk Viewer” that showed the impacts of climate change on rivers and water sheds, and how that might affect water supplies in the future.

“We’re really glad that USDA recognized that this blatantly unlawful purge is harming farmers and researchers and advocates all across the country, and we’re ready to ensure that USDA follows through on this promise,” Jeffrey Stein, an associate attorney with the nonprofit legal organization Earthjustice that represented the plaintiffs, tells The Verge.

The initial complaint accused the USDA of violating the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that gives the public the right to access key records from any federal agency, the Paperwork Reduction Act that stipulates adequate notice before changing access to information, and the Administrative Procedure Act that governs the way federal agencies develop regulations.

President Trump’s backing of the fossil fuel industry has also stripped farmers of federal funding through climate-related programs. The Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York has lost nearly half of its budget this year due to funding freezes, which it has been trying to make up for through donations, according to Craig.

“This has been one of so many cuts. You know, pain by a thousand cuts,” Craig says. “This [legal victory] was good … then, of course, after the initial feeling, you sit back, you take a breath, and you say, ‘and we still have a whole lot of work to do.’”",Science

The Trump administration brought webpages back online, meeting a court-ordered deadline at 11:59PM on February 11th.

Doctors for America (DFA), which represents physicians and medical students, filed suit last week against the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) for taking health data off government websites.

A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, setting a deadline for those agencies to make that information available again online. The order includes more than a dozen CDC and FDA webpages that were specifically mentioned in the lawsuit. That includes the social vulnerability index and environmental justice index, for example, which are tools that show whether particular populations might face disproportionate health risks.

Doctors for America (DFA), which represents physicians and medical students, filed suit

DFA alleges that the agencies violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act by removing public access to the webpages without giving adequate notice in advance. The CDC, FDA, and HHS didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge.

The agencies started taking webpages down after President Donald Trump signed an anti-trans executive order, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” on his first day in office. The CDC’s main data portal went down briefly before going live again with a note saying, “Data.CDC.gov is temporarily offline in order to comply” with the executive order.

The court order says webpages are supposed to be restored to versions as of January 30th. The Verge wasn’t able to immediately verify whether the restored pages have the same content they had on January 30th.

The plaintiffs claim that removing the data forced DFA members “to scramble in search of alternative resources to guide how they treat patients; slowed their clinical practices or reduced the amount of information they can convey to patients in time-limited visits; and paused or slowed their vital research.” They say a temporary restraining order is necessary to protect their practices and public health while the lawsuit determines whether the defendants’ actions were lawful or not.

Beyond the webpages named in the lawsuit, the defendants are also supposed to work with DFA to identify any other resources that need to be restored, setting a February 14th deadline for those webpages to become available again.",Science

The term “climate change” has started to vanish from Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) website. Its former “climate resilience” website has been rebranded under the title “future conditions.” There are still subtle references to climate change there, but it’s more of a whisper than an urgent warning as it was before.

It’s more of a whisper than an urgent warning

The webpage formerly titled “climate resilience” used to say at the top:

“Climate change is the defining crisis of our time. From extreme heat, drought and wildfires to more severe coastal storms, sea-level rise and inland flooding, the consequences of climate change are all around us.”

Reading the current webpage in comparison is like playing one of those games where you have to guess what changed in a picture. (Hint: there’s a double-space typo where the words “climate change” used to be.) The paragraph now says:

“Disaster incidents are rising due to increased human vulnerability, exposure and a changing climate. From extreme heat, drought and wildfires to more severe coastal storms, sea-level rise and inland flooding, the consequences are all around us.”

There are several mentions of climate that have been removed from the page, according to an analysis by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI). The group of researchers came together after Trump was first elected in 2016 to document what might happen to public environmental data. The group found a nearly 40 percent drop in the use of the term “climate change” across websites for federal environmental agencies during the first Trump administration.

As the agency that coordinates federal responses to all kinds of disasters from hurricanes to wildfires, FEMA risks developing a major blindspot in its work if it ignores the effects of climate change. Climate change made the deadly Los Angeles wildfires more likely in January, in just one terrifying instance.

FEMA faces more existential threats, of course, under the Trump administration. The president signed an executive order on January 24th establishing a “review council” to assess whether the agency can “capably and impartially address disasters,” alleging “serious concerns of political bias in FEMA.”

FEMA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge. The changes were made on January 21st, a day after Trump’s inauguration. “We do not know the intention of the team who renamed this website,” EDGI wrote in a blog post today. “Perhaps it was to fly under the radar of the new administration; perhaps it was to align with the priorities of the new administration.”

Other webpages for FEMA and other government agencies are a mixed bag when it comes to mentioning climate change. The Department of Transportation took down a webpage for “climate and sustainability” from its “priorities” website. But other longstanding web resources on climate are still online.

EDGI and other groups have been scrambling to archive federal webpages and datasets. But there are still bigger questions about what happens if those agencies stop paying attention to climate change altogether. As the adage goes, you can’t manage what you don’t measure.",Science

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

The Trump administration has been hacking away at federal government websites, taking down information about climate change and anything deemed “woke.” Now, there’s an online tool you can use to track the changes and find missing information.

Researchers initially developed the Federal Environmental Web Tracker to document similar changes during the first Trump administration, and they resurrected the tool this week. It’s basically a big spreadsheet that includes links to webpages that are either down completely or have had significant changes made since Trump stepped back into office.

By early February, just a couple weeks or so after Trump stepped into office, FEMA was already deleting the term “climate” from its website. As of this morning, the Federal Environmental Web Tracker includes more than 200 entries for federal webpages that have been altered. It’ll be updated weekly by the nonprofit group that made it, called the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

The Federal Environmental Web Tracker includes more than 200 entries for federal webpages that have been altered

Some of the changes are subtle — like an Environmental Protection Agency webpage that shares data on pollution from power plants being renamed “Power Sector Data” instead of “Power Sector Emissions Data.” The data’s still there, and the change in the title might help that information stay online by flying under the radar, as Trump administration officials arbitrarily yank stuff they consider taboo.

But there are also entire webpages or sections of content that have vanished. Much of that content relates to the ways that certain communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution because of poverty or the history of segregation and racism in the US. EPA pages on climate change, human health, and children’s health, for example, no longer include links to information about “equity.”

Thanks to EDGI and other groups archiving these webpages, you can use the resurrected web tracker and the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to see old versions of websites. Documenting the transformation taking place now is crucial for policymakers and advocates who want to make that information publicly available again.

Advocates are already taking action to try to bring resources back online. Organic farmers filed suit against the Trump administration last week for removing content they rely on to help them grow crops, alleging that the US Department of Agriculture’s sudden removal of key online resources broke federal law. It follows a similar lawsuit filed by doctors that led to some federal webpages on health disparities being restored.",Science

https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679470/taskrabbit-ceo-ania-smith-labor-gig-economy-work-ai-automation,"Today, I’m talking with Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith. Taskrabbit is one of the original gig worker platforms that’s really focused on work you might need done in your home; it’s been around for nearly 20 years, and you might be surprised to know that the core product has not changed all that much. Taskers can sign up to offer services like assembling furniture, mounting TVs, and helping people move, and they get to set their own prices for that work, which makes it a more of a marketplace than something like Uber.

As you’ll hear Ania say, the difference between Taskrabbit and something like Thumbtack or Angi is that Taskrabbit manages the entire interaction from end to end — it’s not just a directory but also where people can leave reviews, get customer service, and manage all their payments.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

Ania describes all this as matching supply and demand, and we talked a lot about where that supply of labor comes from and what it might mean that there are more Taskers than ever right now. That feels like a bit of a recession indicator to me — that’s a lot of people looking for additional income — but Ania had a more measured view and pointed out that there are some Taskers earning a very comfortable living on the platform.

Taskrabbit is also now notably owned by Ikea, which has a lot of interest in how the platform grows and what kinds of services it can integrate into the experience of being an Ikea customer. Assembling Ikea furniture is a core Taskrabbit service, after all, and I wanted to know if there was any pressure to specialize that service or prioritize Ikea work over other companies.

But if you’ve been listening to Decoder recently, you know that the heart of this conversation was about the next wave of user interfaces — particularly, the next wave of AI assistants that can book services like Taskrabbit, DoorDash, Uber for you. Google actually gave a demo of one of its agents going through Taskrabbit’s website a couple weeks ago, and I’m very curious how all these services are thinking about having those kinds of tools step in between them and their customers.

After all, if you’re just asking a voice assistant to get someone to help you mount a TV, you’re probably not using the Taskrabbit website yourself. That’s a big change, and Ania and I talked about it for a while — you’ll hear her say Taskrabbit’s end-to-end focus is the differentiator here and that other platforms will find it hard to compete with that.

Okay: Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Ania Smith, you are the CEO of Taskrabbit. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you for having me. Excited to be here.

I’m very excited to talk to you. It feels like there’s a lot of change coming to the service economy on our phones. There’s a lot of change in the economy in general that is interesting to talk about. Let’s start at the very beginning. TaskRabbit has been around for a while. You’ve been the CEO for about five years. How would you describe Taskrabbit today? How should people think about it?

So it’s pretty similar to what it has been. We connect people who need help around the home with a vast network of highly skilled and reliable Taskers who can help you with cleaning, mounting your TV, assembling your furniture, or a range of other tasks around the home. And I think we do that pretty well.

Taskrabbit was founded in 2008. Many things have happened since then. We’ve gone from a desktop paradigm to a mobile paradigm. Competitors have shown up. There’s Fiverr, which I think of as where you go to get a cheap logo. Do you think of Taskrabbit as expansive into digital services? You’re describing hanging TVs. Is it more of a physical services platform?

Today it is, and that’s really our focus. It is our vision to become the number one marketplace for home services specifically. There’s a lot of things to get done around the home, everything from putting down mulch and cleaning your gutters to mowing your lawn. Then there’s so much to do inside the home.

There’s also a lot to do with big moments in your life, when you think about starting a family or moving. Moving is a perfect example. You have to clean your old place, clean the new place, pack, unpack, find an actual moving service, mount TVs, assemble. So, there are a lot of use cases where these services are still very much needed.

One thing that’s interesting about that market in particular is that there’s no shortage of gardening companies, moving companies, or people on Craigslist who will hang your TV for you. There are AV installation companies at the high end. Do you want the companies who are doing customer discovery on the platform or do you want individuals?

Today we definitely focus on individuals. We’re getting to a point where half of workers in the US are actually gig economy workers. That means many things, right? Not all of them are doing furniture assembly, but many are using these platforms to find additional work and to have the flexibility to transition between different stages of life. That’s what we focus on, and those are the people who we want to help.

We’re here to provide a meaningful income to folks who need it. There are a lot of people who may be between jobs or students who have time on weekends or during the summers, and there’s a lot of opportunity to make a pretty good living on Taskrabbit. An average hourly pay is close to $50 an hour, and in some markets, it’s well over $50. So, there are a lot of great opportunities to make a meaningful income for yourself and your family.

When you say meaningful income at $50 per hour, that’s not a full-time work week at $50 an hour, right? That’s piecework. How much are people making on the high end on Taskrabbit?

We have people making well over $200,000 a year. It’s been a couple years now, but there was a Tasker I spoke with who was a student at NYU. One of his friends was moving and using Taskrabbit. He had never heard of Taskrabbit, so he looked it up. This was 2022 or 2023, and he said, “Hey, maybe I can do this while I look for a job.”

So, he got smart and figured out how to mount TVs fairly quickly just by learning it on YouTube and really optimized his jobs. He could sometimes mount as many as three TVs in an hour in Manhattan. This is all he did for his first year after graduation, and he made well over $200,000 a year.

Is that sustainable? I know a lot of people in the industry who have AV installation companies, for example. They go from that to “I’m going to design you a home theater system” to “I’m going to sell you the components of that at some high margin.” That’s how you build your business. But that’s different from “I’m going to install a lot of TVs every single day for the rest of my life.” Is something like that totally sustainable on Taskrabbit?

No, but how many people have the same job for the rest of their lives? We have Taskers who’ve been here for five, six, or 10 years, which is great. Sometimes they leave, they come back, and they leave again. It just really depends on what’s going on in their lives. We want to make sure that we provide the opportunity. If people do want to come and earn an income, we’re here to help them do that. For us, that means getting as many jobs as possible so that we can make sure our Taskers have jobs that they can do.

So, $200,000 is the high end. It’s a great, shiny number. What’s the median?

I don’t think that I know the median. It really depends on the market. There’s obviously liquidity and density questions, and it also depends on the category. Many of our Taskers are not working what you would consider full time. They are doing this as a stop measure in between gigs or just in the evenings. So, we don’t really track the median earnings because everyone has such a specific and different use case. What we think about is what are your weekly targets for earning if you want to work as much as possible in a week,and how can we help you reach those targets? We find that that’s what Taskers really resonate with.

What are the biggest markets for you?

New York City is by far our biggest market, and it has been probably since we launched there [in 2011]. But we have a lot of growth in our secondary and tertiary markets. Also, we’re now in eight countries. London has become a huge market for us, which is really exciting to see. Toronto is a big market as well. Obviously, the Bay Area is still our home, and so we have really great brand equity there. LA is a big market. We’re now in hundreds and hundreds of cities across the globe. It’s fun since sometimes we get into competitions to see which city can grow faster, but they all have different trajectories.

Is the action mostly in cities?

Today, yes. As you know, we’re owned by Ikea, so we also definitely think a lot about how we can support the Ikea business and support Ikea customers who want their furniture to be assembled and delivered. In the US, we also do delivery for Ikea, and so we make sure that we can cover all Ikea stores. Most of them are not located in urban city centers, and they’re much bigger in Europe. So, a market like Germany has 50 to 60 stores, which is the same as the number of stores in the US but the US is triple or quadruple the size of Germany. It’s much more densely populated, and we want to make sure that we cover all the Ikea markets.

I want to come back to the Ikea relationship because I think that is super interesting. It’s been several years now and I’m very curious how that has developed. But I want to stay focused on the cities for one second. I lived in New York City for a long time. Now I live in the suburbs. When I moved to the suburbs, I just started buying more and more tools. It’s just a thing that happens when you move to the suburbs. I didn’t have the space to have a bunch of tools and capabilities in my apartment in New York City. Is that why there are bigger markets in the cities? People just don’t have the stuff or the skills?

I think it has to do a lot with market density and liquidity. You want to be closer to the jobs, but I would say the suburbs are our fastest growing markets overall compared to cities because there is just a lot of opportunity. When we moved to the suburbs, my husband was also very keen to buy tools and start doing work around the house, and that didn’t turn out very well for us. Maybe it turns out well for others, but we still have Taskers here quite often because there’s just a lot of work to do. You have more square footage, and by definition, every single additional square foot will require more work. So, we see a lot of potential in the suburbs as well.

One of the things that is interesting to me about the broader economy, as you’re describing it, is the people who want to fill their time with work. They want to make more money and see the opportunity and that liquidity in the market. But that supply of effort requires time, right? People’s time isn’t being filled with their full-time jobs. They’re between jobs or they might be out of a job. Do you see a correlation between the health of the overall economy and the Tasker supply?

We do. For around the last three years, we’ve definitely seen more supply than we can handle on the platform. We now have waitlists in many cities because we don’t want to onboard a Tasker and then not be able to provide them with jobs. It’s sort of a false premise. I want to make sure that if you are on our platform, there’s work for you to do. As the economy has changed over the last few years — especially over the last couple of years as we’ve seen a bit more struggle — we’ve had thousands and thousands of Taskers applying every year. It’s 15 to 20 percent more than the year before.

Does that feel like a recession indicator to you?

I’m not an economist, and I read all of this stuff just like you do. If you do read that stuff, we should’ve had a recession last year and one the year before, and those predictions turn out to be wrong. So, I think the word is “uncertainty.” We just don’t know because at least over the last two years, we understood what was going on a little bit more.

There’s just a lot of uncertainty overall. It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen with tariffs, with bond yields, with interest rates, with the housing market. All I can say is we see an increase in Tasker applications. I’m not sure that that’s an indication that a recession is coming.

Do you see an increase in the number of people who are buying services from Taskrabbit? Because that’s the other side of the equation. Is demand also going up?

Demand is going up, and that’s great to see. There’s a bit of a caveat to that, and it’s not just Taskrabbit. There are, as you mentioned, multiple players. For all of us, demand is going up. We’re still such a small portion of the overall market and its overall possibilities. Most people still assemble their own furniture, put up their own TVs, and clean their own houses. Even though we see a lot of growth, there’s still so much opportunity to continue growing. Even after 10 to 15 years, it still feels like the market is quite nascent and services are still hard to figure out. There’s a lot to think about, especially when it comes to how we match the perfect Tasker to the client.

I talk a lot about mounting. We have thousands of Taskers who can mount your TV, which is great, but can they be available on a Friday evening, mount it on a brick wall, and know how to hide the cables? That’s a different skill than mounting a smaller TV on a normal wall. There’s a lot of variables that go into an actual perfect job, and we still have a lot of work to do there. So, there’s still a lot of growth opportunity.

I love that we’re talking about mounting TVs so much because that’s totally my wheelhouse, and The Verge audience knows that. I love talking about mounting TVs. This is great. We’re just in the strike zone for me.

How do you get that data? How do you evaluate who is good at mounting a TV above a fireplace versus just on a regular piece of drywall?

There are many ways. First of all, we now have AI models and tools that help us do this even faster, but the Taskers themselves tell us what capabilities they have, and we ask pretty structured questions and they can actually explain. But the bigger piece of data comes from their experience on the platform and having done similar tasks previously.

So if they tell us that they hung up this type of TV, we can use that data to match them to exactly that kind of job again. Of course, the clients provide reviews, so we can search automatically just with words, and there’s then structured data and understanding their skill set. We take that all into consideration as we build out a more optimal match.

There’s a relationship there between what customers are saying, the reviews they’re leaving, whether they validate the skills, and the rates that Taskers can charge. Is that a correlation you can measure?

Taskers do set their own rates, which makes us very different from many of the other platforms that you see in the market. It’s why so many Taskers actually love coming to Taskrabbit. If I had to summarize, they fully recognize how to set their rates, so we provide a lot of guidance to them. We take into consideration where you are based, what types of tasks you perform, your previous reviews. And then based on what the market is doing, we have a rate we could potentially suggest. They don’t take our suggestions all the time, which is fine. They get to set their own rate.

To bring it back to TV mounting — again, my favorite topic — you could pay less money for someone with fewer reviews and take on more risk that they might not know what they’re doing. Or you might pay more money for someone who appears to know what they’re doing.

That feels like a pricing strategy that should exist on the platform. Whenever we talk about the gig economy, I get workers emailing us saying, “I just want to know how to make more money.” It feels like on Taskrabbit, the best way to do it is to just charge more because they can set the rates.

Of course, they can set the rates, but if they charge too much, the market is not going to reward them in a way they might want. So, you can definitely set your rates higher than what the market is willing to bear. If you’re in a market where there are thousands of other Taskers, that’ll manifest itself on the platform by having you essentially get fewer jobs if you’re pricing much higher than what clients are willing to pay.

Do you see that rates go up over time for an individual Tasker or in aggregate?

Rates are going up in aggregate. They definitely have ebbed and flowed. It also matters a lot on the markets. Certain markets are obviously much higher than other markets. As we see trends with inflation and what’s going on externally, the rates tend to follow because even supplies are becoming more expensive for Taskers. Then, their lives are becoming more expensive, so they need to charge more as well. So we do see, in aggregate, rates moving up.

Do you know the categories where rates have gone up the highest?

It really depends. Moving is one of our highest categories in terms of rates just because it’s a more complex product. You can take hours to help someone move. In terms of total job number, that’s obviously one of the higher ones. If you look at per hour numbers, it really varies by market. There isn’t a single trend.

Then in aggregate, the rates across the platform are going up as well?

Yes.

If I’m an individual Tasker there for five years, is it generally true that I can just charge more over time because I have more reviews and more data to back up that I know what I’m doing?

I don’t think that’s generally true because if you have a lot more supply in that market, you’re competing all the time. You can’t just assume that you’re going to be able to raise your rates over time. When people start up, it’s a bit similar to Airbnb. When you’re a brand new host, you come in and you have no reviews and no ratings. You want people to stay in your home and you want to do a good job, so you may price a bit lower just to make sure that you show up in search results and that people book your place.

As you gain more experience, understand what your guests want, provide those things for them, and you continue to get really great reviews and really great feedback, you’re able to raise the prices. But there’s a limit as more and more Airbnbs show up in that market. So, there are many components that help you figure out how to price, and Airbnb, just like Taskrabbit, also helps hosts figure out what the right pricing schematic could be. But it’s definitely not just a science.

Airbnb is a perfect example because it lets people set rates and it has all kinds of pricing tools. The other end is Uber, which doesn’t let anyone set a price. If you’re the best Uber driver or the worst, it kind of doesn’t matter. Uber is just pricing for you. That dynamic has led to a lot of frustration over there.

It seems like the challenge in your case is that if you get good enough, get famous enough, and you’ve had enough customers, you might leave the platform. You can just do more effective marketing and take a higher margin on your own. How do you make sure you don’t have that graduation problem?

I mean you could, but it’s not just about marketing. That’s one of the biggest services that we provide, but it’s also about scheduling. It’s also about providing some level of protection so if things go wrong, we’re there to help, and to provide consistent work. So yes, you can leave the platform and try to do this on your own. We hope that we provide such great service to our Taskers that it’s harder for them to manage outside of the platform.

For example, if you’re working on multiple platforms or doing it on your own, you’re managing your own Google Calendar. It’s really hard to sync them all and think about how to manage your time appropriately. We can help do that for you. We can help figure it out and make sure that the tasks we’re providing are the ones most matched to your skill set because we understand your history and we understand what the client wants. We can make sure that the tasks that are visible to you are the ones that are closer to your home.

So, there are a lot of additional services and benefits that we provide to the Taskers where they want to stay on a platform because it’s easier for them. Also, if they set a rate of $100 per hour, they get to take home $100, which is very different from some of the other platforms.

Walk me through that. What’s the revenue model for you? How do you make your money?

We make our money just like many platforms do, where we have to charge either one or both sides of the marketplace for the services we provide. I just explained some of the services for Taskers. We also provide a lot of services to the clients. The way things work on our platform for clients is when they book a job, they pay an additional service fee to Taskrabbit for everything from quality assurance and fraud to just being able to find the Tasker.

You’re saying these people have been vetted. They actually know how to hang the TV.

Exactly.

There’s a lot of temptation in every marketplace like this to charge both sides. Why not charge the Taskers?

To be fair, we haven’t tried this. We haven’t experimented with this at least since I’ve been here. I believe this has been tested previously. I think that the Taskers themselves are keen to provide the best service that they can, and we want to make sure that we are a supply-based marketplace. As you well know, this thing doesn’t work without supply, and you kind of have to start with supply.

For me and for Taskrabbit, it’s really important that we have the best quality supply, and we don’t need to be charging the Taskers for that. We don’t use a lead gen model. We are instead making sure that the entire job gets booked from the very beginning. We’re there to hold it together with the client and the Tasker all the way through to payment as opposed to just giving a client a few names and saying, “Go try them out.” So, we believe that the service we’re providing is ensuring that the job happens and it’s high quality. For that, we primarily charge the client.

You’ve made a distinction here between what you call lead gen platforms where they charge for demand. You’re a plumber, you want to get some customers, you would charge some service to get you some customers. Describe what you mean by lead gen and how Taskrabbit is different.

So I’ll just talk about what Taskrabbit does and then perhaps compare it a bit to what other platforms do. Taskrabbit allows you to book a Tasker on a platform. I guess one word to think about what we do is “shepherd” this process all the way through. So, we make sure that the Tasker shows up, that the task actually gets done, and then we collect payment from you and the client. We then distribute that payment to the Tasker, make sure that you can write the review for the Tasker, and so on.

There’s just a whole slew of things that happen, including the fact that if something goes wrong, you can pick up the phone and call or you can send us a message and say, “Hey, the Tasker’s late,” or, “The Tasker canceled, what should I do next?” That’s different than just getting the names of three or four potential providers and forcing you as a client to call each of them and start negotiating on a price or the time before the person comes and does whatever task. If something goes wrong, it’s really just between you and that provider. With us, we’re there all the way through until the job closes.

When you say you’re not a lead gen model, that feels really important. That’s a principle that you need to hold onto because every other company that’s similarly situated does sort of charge both sides. Substack, for example, takes 10 percent of everyone’s earnings just to send emails. It would tell you it does a lot more than just send emails,

But it has a graduation problem. People leave the platform because you can get cheaper email distribution elsewhere. Substack has to build new services in order to justify its 10 percent for its highest-volume writers. You don’t have that problem. Does that pressure just not exist or does that pressure exist and you keep it away?

Of course it exists. So Taskers definitely leave the platform, and clients leave the platform.

Sorry, I meant the pressure to charge both sides of the marketplace.

No because again, I really feel that we don’t need to charge the Taskers to make the money that we make. We provide enough services to both sides, but the client is willing to bear that cost and that has worked for us. It doesn’t mean that it’s always going to work and that our models and the way we match are always going to be the same. We’re constantly experimenting. We are looking at other ways with many of the components that we’re talking about because we have to continue evolving. But right now, this works for us. So today, we don’t see changing the model to charge Taskers.

I think that brings me to Ikea. So Ikea bought Taskrabbit in 2017. It’s a complicated transaction, but the upshot is Ikea now owns Taskrabbit. Do you think it’s that ownership that protects you from the pressure to increase revenue by charging both sides of the marketplace? I feel like if you were a public company you might feel that pressure much more keenly.

It may be. I don’t know. I’ve never been a CEO of a public company. I can tell you that we have pretty big goals and high pressure from Ikea. Obviously, there is a component of stability that comes with having Ikea as a parent, and there are good and bad things about this. The good thing is we are not a public company nor VC-funded, and I don’t have to worry about how things are going to evolve financially in the same way.

But that can make you a bit more complacent. So we’re trying hard to ensure that we have very ambitious goals and a very big vision so that the teams work really hard to continue to grow. There are many ways that we can drive the business forward, actually build growth capabilities. Charging Taskers is not one of them, but there are many other ways where we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of growth.

Let me ask you the big Decoder question here, which is expressed in two ways. First, how is Taskrabbit structured inside of Ikea? How does that work?

Well, we operate very independently inside of Ikea. I report to a board and the board is made up of Ikea executives and external board members. We have three board meetings a year because Ikea works in tertials, not quarters.

That’s very Ikea to make up its own complicated Swedish word. It’s perfect.

It’s so Ikea, but it works for me. So, we meet three times a year, we set targets together, and that’s it. Now, I do work very closely with Ikea in a different way — more in a business sense — where there was a lot of opportunity to ensure that Ikea customers have access to Taskrabbit. In some sense, Taskrabbit customers have access to Ikea, but Ikea has millions of people visiting its apps, its sites, and, of course, its big stores. We want to make sure that we have access to those customers in the best way possible.

So, we’ve done some great things there. Just recently in the US — but we had done so elsewhere before — we made it so that it’s much more seamless for Ikea customers to purchase, let’s say, a desk and assembly all at the same time and pay for it at Ikea checkout versus having to go separately to the Taskrabbit app, try to put in the very fun Ikea furniture names, and then try to figure out how to get it assembled. That’s a great example of how the two companies can really leverage their capabilities.

At the end of the day, Ikea purchased Taskrabbit under the premise that there are some potential Ikea customers who don’t want to be Ikea customers because they feel overwhelmed by the idea of putting together furniture. We want to be there to help to solve that problem, and I think we’ve done a very good job there.

Let me connect that to the supply conversation we were just having. I’ve put together a lot of Ikea furniture in my day. I feel like I’m pretty good at it. That’s a relatively specialized skill. Reading an Ikea instruction manual is like learning another language in many ways.

I think it depends who you ask. Some people are really good at this.

By the way, one of my dream stories is that we go to a conference of flat-pack furniture designers and the Ikea people come in dressed all in black and everyone’s like, “It’s the Ikea designers.” It’s obviously the easiest to put together, but it’s like a whole ecosystem.

It’s a whole thing. But I can tell you, watching our Taskers put together Ikea furniture, it is impressive. They know the furniture, so they can do this so well inside and out. They just do it with such speed. You may be good, but you’re never going to be an Ikea Tasker who is doing this day in and day out.

That’s kind of what I’m getting at. It’s a specialized skill. I would actually say putting together Ikea furniture is different than putting together the furniture you would buy at Target or Walmart. They’re different companies with different styles. The way that things fit together is literally different.

Again, my dream story is that we find rival flat-pack design gangs and put them head to head. I don’t know if that’s how it works, it’s just how it works in my brain. That’s a specialized supply. Do you keep that pool aside and say, “These are the people who are best at assembling Ikea kitchens and we’re going to make sure they’re available to Ikea”?

They get to choose. I would say the majority of the Taskers who assemble Ikea furniture are also really good at assembling furniture from Wayfair, Target, and other places. They want to assemble furniture. The way it works on our platform is there’s an Ikea assembly furniture category because, like you said, it’s specialized, but then there’s just furniture assembly where it could be a piece from anywhere. Those Taskers definitely cross.

Many of them are also handymen, so they will do minor home repairs, like if your doorknob is loose. They have great skills. Some of them want to just focus only on Ikea furniture, but I would say that’s the minority. Many of them cross into multiple categories.

Because Ikea is a parent, do you reserve supply or is that just not a problem?

It’s just not a problem in all the countries that we serve. I alluded to this earlier, but Ikea is much bigger in Europe, so a larger portion of our Taskers know how to assemble Ikea furniture in Europe versus the US because we get a lot more Ikea jobs in Europe. The Ikea business is just much stronger over there. So no, we don’t keep them separate. We let them choose whatever category they want. We do not have any challenges with finding supply though, even in Europe.

You mentioned that Ikea has its own pressures on you and its own goals for Taskrabbit. What are those goals?

The goals are always about growth. How do we continue to grow faster and how do we continue to evolve where we’re solving the right problems for the overall customer and the Ikea customer? We just recently acquired a delivery company here in the US that does delivery of big and bulky things so that we can help Ikea deliver furniture to your home.

It wants to make sure that we are able to expand to other countries. We’re only in eight countries, while Ikea is in dozens of countries, so there’s still a lot of opportunity for growth that way. So, there are definitely pressures, but they’re similar to what any other parent or investor would have.

And then there’s Taskrabbit itself. How many people is Taskrabbit?

Right now, we’re nearly 500 folks.

How is that structured?

So, we are structured like many other companies. Today, we’re very functionally focused with a matrix overlay. We have [general managers] looking over the US market and GMs looking over the European market and each country. There’s always a bit of tension… or I would say maybe not a bit. I would like there to be a bit, there’s probably a lot of tension between some of the needs that are unique per market or per country versus having fully functional ways of thinking about the problems.

As an example, there are different competitive pressures in different markets, and there are different ways that customers go onto platforms and book their tasks. There are specific needs that customers in France have that are not applicable to the market in the US. How do we make that tradeoff? France is a much smaller overall portion of our business than the US, but you have to continue growing across the world. So, there’s definitely healthy tension across there.

Put that into practice. What Taskrabbit makes most of all is a software product. You say that customers in France have needs that customers in the US don’t have. What are those needs and how do they get expressed in the product?

For example, there is some local tax law in France that allows customers who do work on their house to get some tax benefit, which is a great thing. This isn’t something we have in the US, and so we want to make sure that customers have access to that. But to do that, you have to build out a different flow and allow them to be able to submit whatever tax documents that say that this is the work they’ve done. There’s dozens of these examples across markets.

Marketing campaigns also have to be different because people are different in every market, and they resonate with different types of themes and creative. How do we go broad but also have local capabilities? That ends up causing tension across the world, and that’s what makes it fun. Certainly we don’t have it figured out yet.

My joke on Decoder is if you tell me the structure of your company, I can tell you 80 percent of the problems. If you tell me you’re functional with a hybrid overlay, I can definitely tell you 80 percent of the problems.

Here’s the thing: I’ve gone through that a lot, but there is no perfect structure. If there was one, then we would all be doing that, and we wouldn’t have to have this conversation. If you have a functional structure, it creates certain sets of problems. You can sort of fix them by going to a GM or a business unit structure. Then, unsurprisingly, you create other sets of problems. So, to me, it is not so much about the structure. It’s much more about the skills and capabilities that people have, the incentives, and how they are uniquely positioned to work across boundaries, functions, or geographies. That’s much harder to do.

It really comes back to culture. What are our values and how do we get people to really think and row in the same direction, whatever the strategy may be? Those are the bigger problems, and I don’t think that changing the structure gets you closer to an answer. I think these types of adaptive problems are more difficult to solve and are actually more challenging. I don’t think changing structure is the answer.

Maybe one of the hottest quiet debates on the show over the past few months is whether or not structure is a proxy for culture. You seem to be very much in the line that it’s not. We’ve had some opposite answers, but it feels like the split to me is whether you have multiple kinds of businesses you’re running or you have one core product.

Once you end up in the multiple lines of business, the structure starts to reflect very different kinds of tensions and tradeoffs. Do you think that Taskrabbit has just one core business, or do you have multiple lines of business that you’re trying to operate?

Historically, it’s been one core business, but it’s definitely separate from the delivery piece. There are many different things that we need to think about. We need to think about A to B, which we didn’t have to think about before. We need to think about how to locate all sorts of components that are different from our core business. Still, it’s really important to us. We think it’s a great opportunity that is very connected to the moving business.

We are thinking a lot about what that means. Do we have a separate moving business business unit and what does that look like? Again, at the end of the day, it’s not so much about structure. It’s much more about the culture, how we can feel a sense of shared responsibility across the company, understanding what our priorities are, and what our vision and strategy are. Is it all aligned? Are we all able to row in the same direction? Is it very clear? Have we set the right expectations? These, again, are things that I think are more difficult to answer.

The other big question to ask everybody on Decoder is about decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

I know there are many different answers here. I think there are different ways to describe them — one-way doors are decisions that I’m sure you’ve heard of — but the things that are really hard to reverse. So, closing down the office during COVID, reopening an office, or acquiring a company.

These are bigger decisions, but I really trust my team and then think a lot about how they are empowering their teams to make their own decisions. I spend a lot of my time with customers. I think it’s really important, whether it’s having Taskers at my house or spending a lot of time interviewing Taskers or clients. But day to day, I’m not as close to the problem as the people who I want to have the authority or the agency to solve those problems. They are hopefully spending much more time with the customer than even I am and understanding that specific problem much better than my team and I do.

For me, it’s really important to empower the team to make decisions. You have to test and try. The thing that we keep focusing on is making decisions quickly because the speed is what gets you behind. You can constantly be looking for more data and more certainty, and most of that doesn’t exist. You have to start using your gut — your instinct or however you define that — to look at your past experience. You have some pattern recognition. You kind of understand how things may go, you weigh them, and you make a call. Doing that quicker is the most important thing.

You just described being close to the customer. It’s interesting. Your history at Uber is as the head of courier operations, right?

That’s right.

You were on the supply side working with the courier.

Same with Airbnb. I definitely have a soft spot for the supply side of the business. Frankly, this is why I am doing the gig economy. When I was younger, my family and I emigrated from Poland. In the ‘80s, my parents were trying to find jobs with more hours. It was all hourly work, and it was hard to make ends meet. I often wish that these types of platforms existed then because no matter what, you can hustle and make more money. I definitely can relate to the supply side of the business a lot more.

How do you make sure that the Taskers are happy? If everyone is doing this kind of work because they’re not making enough money, there’s sort of an inherent unhappiness there. How do you make sure that they are happy and enthusiastic about doing this instead of having to do it because the economy is in turmoil?

I don’t know if the premise that Taskers are unhappy is right.

I think the premise that supply is increasing because the economy is in turmoil is kind of bearing itself out.

Correct. But I’ll tell you, I have Taskers showing up at my house every month or week, and these are people who are really striving to make an incremental income or their main income. They love having the opportunity to use their skills to do something or to help someone else while making a pretty good wage, generally speaking. Like I’ve said, we’ve done a lot of things. We try to provide a lot of additional benefits for them. We try to help them and make sure that they can call us.

We have a whole team that is focused just on helping Taskers make money. This team will help you think about how you set prices, think about the categories you’re in, how you can make sure that your write-up is correct, and so on. We’re providing a lot of AI tools for Taskers to do that as well, but having that human interaction really helps. So, if you’re here on our platform and you want to make money, there’s an opportunity to make money. We want to be the people who help them do that.

I’m very curious about what you have Taskers at your house to do every couple of weeks. How many TVs are you hanging up Ania?

[Laughs] No, it’s not TVs. Don’t tell my husband this because he still pretends that he can do these things, but he really doesn’t. He doesn’t notice that it’s broken and he doesn’t notice that it’s now fixed. The house just runs. This is okay.

I had someone come in here the other day and mount a bunch of pictures in my son’s room. I had someone come in to assemble furniture, like these bookcases behind me. I had someone come to help with my lawn. There’s an infinite number of ways to get someone to help you in your home.

What have you learned about your own platform that you wanted to improve by using it as much as you do?

So much. Make it simpler. Always make it simpler. Make it easier. I may not care to choose who the Tasker is. I just want to make sure that it’s going to be a person who can do the job really well, and I want to do it as affordably as I can. So sometimes, it would be appreciated to have a bit more help in choosing. So, we’re working on that.

You’ve mentioned AI several times. I’ve been asking basically everyone what happens when you have agents and more capable assistants built into your phones. I keep calling this the “DoorDash problem,” but you could call it the “Taskrabbit problem” or the “Uber problem.” The idea that I could just tell Siri, “I need to get a TV hung up,” and then Siri goes off, clicks around the apps for me, and brings a Tasker to my house is very powerful.

There are a lot of companies attempting to build their way towards that goal. Google just announced a bunch of stuff, Microsoft just announced a bunch of stuff. That would disintermediate you, right? At the end of the day, you would just become a commoditized service provider to an assistant that might be collecting all the user interaction and own the customer relationship. Have you looked forward to that problem? Do you know how you want to address it?

I absolutely look forward to the problem. I look at it a little bit differently. If those agents exist, you have to go to where the customer is. We have people that come to our sites every day, but if people want to go to Ikea and book a Tasker via Ikea, we’re not going to say no. If they want to go to Target and do that, we’re not going to say no. If they want to go to Siri and do that, we’re not going to say no. It’s very easy to fall into thinking, “I don’t own the customer” and “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the customer.”

But the customer will know that this is a Tasker, or we can make sure that they know that this is a Tasker. They can understand that they’re working with another party, and they can come back directly or they don’t have to. Then, there will be some economic way to figure out a system where it works for both parties. Siri, in this case, wants to be able to provide these types of services, and they can’t really do it without Taskrabbit because only Taskrabbit actually has a network of thousands of Taskers. We cultivated that network. We know who they are and we understand their skills. They’ve all been background checked.

Siri, Apple, or whoever is not going to do that. They’re just not going to be able to do that. We will always have the strength and supply, and we will continue to go where the customer is to make sure as many of them have access to our platform as possible.

Isn’t that the story of the internet though? Isn’t it the companies and the platforms that have the strength and demand that get to set the terms?

I think it’s a bit different when you look at a gig economy marketplace. At the end of the day, it takes a lot of work to bring together a set of Taskers or hosts or Uber drivers. It’s really hard to acquire these folks and to make sure that they provide the quality that you want, and I don’t see other companies being able to do that.

I also think it’s too early. There are so many ways to test this and how to make it work. The example that you provided, we’re still not quite there. There are many situations where it sounds great, but there are many that are still hindered from actually being a seamless experience. There’s payments, logging in, accounts, and all sorts of ways that all of this can and will be resolved. But that gives us a chance to test a lot of different models and understand what works best for the Tasker, for the client, and in this case, for the two parties involved.

I’m with you that it hasn’t been proven to work, but I also go to the events and watch Amazon executives demonstrate the next version of Alexa and it books an appointment on Thumbtack when the dishwasher is broken. I can see how you want Taskrabbit in that mix, but then you are next to Thumbtack and the agent might just pick the lowest price, especially if you’re charging the customer. You might just pick the service you were told about.

Look, we’re very different from Thumbtack because Thumbtack is a lead gen product that is very hard to close, whereas we provide the experience all the way through. In the demo that you described, the client still has to go and work with whoever the end provider is. In this case, it’s someone to fix your dishwasher. This isn’t something that we have to do. Our product would look very different because we are able to shepherd the entire experience through.

You close the loop. You actually send the task to the Tasker.

We close the loop, but again, we’re still quite far from where that could go. I think the possibilities are endless, and we have to go where the customer is. If everyone all of a sudden goes and talks to the phone and that’s how they order things or talk to Siri, I don’t know how we would not be there.

Do you think it’s different because you are not a lead gen model? I think about Thumbtack, for example. At some point, it’s just there to deliver demand to a bunch of HVAC technicians or whoever was in that demonstration. Maybe Siri delivers that demand, and Thumbtack gets totally disintermediated. You’re saying that’s not your model and you’re not worried about it, and you’re charging the customer anyway. So would you just charge a higher rate for an agent to solve the problem?

There are so many different economic structures that can work here. We’re in the very early stages. We may all think and guesstimate that this is the right structure, and then at year end we can decide, “Wow, this doesn’t work for us, the third party, or the client. We’re not getting enough people to actually do this.” There’s a lot of trial and error here, and it’s too early to be saying, “This is the right model and this is the right structure.”

What are the most promising early flashes you’ve seen?

I think the concept of having an agent do things for you is very interesting. If you take it a lot further, eventually in theory, we won’t even have laptops, our Kindles, or whatever. We might just have agents constantly doing things for us on other types of devices. I think it’s super exciting to be a part of that journey, but I think none of it has been proven and we’re still actually pretty far away. Although technology is changing so quickly. It’s quite remarkable to watch. It’s quite remarkable to be alive during this time.

I go to all the demos and I have the same reaction as you, which is, “Does this actually work?” They’re very convincing demos.

They are. I was just at a conference where someone was adamantly telling me that it’ll only be three years before a robot can hang up a TV.

I don’t believe that for a second.

I don’t believe that. I just don’t.

I have hung up a lot of TVs.

This person was very adamant. Anytime that I’m hearing about any work that is being done in a physical space, it’s still really far away. They’re working on having robots try to empty the dishwasher, and that’s a complex task. It’s really complex when you really think about it. There’s a lot that still has to happen.

One of the things that I’m thinking about a lot is where does automation come and where does it go? Taskrabbit doesn’t seem easily automatable from the jump, as you’re describing it. A lot of these tasks are really, really hard for robotics to begin to try to solve, like hanging a TV or emptying the dishwasher. Many rounds of innovation have to happen to make that viable.

But for other similarly situated competitors or peers you have like Uber, you can see how automation will change their business. The cars will drive themselves. That’s going to change the business in radical ways, and we’ll see how that goes. Do you see any automation that might change how Taskrabbit works in the near future?

From a software platform perspective? One hundred percent. But in the context of what happens in someone’s home? I really don’t see a robot mowing the lawn just yet. But it will happen.

We just reviewed a bunch of robotic lawnmowers that you can buy and they don’t work very well.

Right. They don’t work very well. The internet didn’t work very well whenever it started. The cellphones we had didn’t work very well. So, it will evolve, but I think we’re still quite far away.

On the software side, what do you see that’s going to change?

For Taskrabbit, how we optimize the match between the client and Tasker is going to change. We can get so much smarter. I think how clients will come to our platform will change. Just the basics of how SEO and SEM work. Those terms will barely apply [in the future], and that will happen much sooner than a robot hanging up your TV. I think that pace of that change is much more accelerated.

Do you think that’s where the growth is going to come from?

Absolutely.

When you talk to one of the car companies, they think all their growth is coming from the cars driving themselves. They can see the massive margins that come from getting rid of the drivers. But you don’t have that opportunity.

Not yet. I understand their point. It’s pretty remarkable to take a Waymo in San Francisco. I was at Walmart many years ago, and Walmart’s offices are right across the street from YouTube. After YouTube became part of Google, there were a lot of self-driving cars — they were not called Waymos then — driving around, and they looked so foreign. Obviously, they had [test] drivers in them. And now look at it. So, this will happen. I understand the excitement. I just think we’re further away from that in home services.

Have you had any conversations with the big AI companies about being a provider to their would-be agent platforms?

We are continually exploring our options.

That’s the only non-answer you’ve given so far and I appreciate it. Does Ikea have a plan to build some great agent? Ikea has had many software platforms of its own over the years.

I’m not sure, so I don’t want to put words in their mouth. I know that AI is a critical investment and that it’s looking at it in all parts of the business, but I wouldn’t know exactly where it sees the most innovation.

When I talked to Dara Khosrowshahi from Uber about what I keep calling the “DoorDash problem,” he said, “Look, at first we’re going to build it and we’ll see if it works. If it’s cool and if it works, we’re going to charge high rates to make our business work, or maybe we’ll come to some other arrangement.” That was basically his point of view.

I think that’s a great answer.

So, you’re tracking there? Let’s just see if this is cool?

Absolutely. Let’s make sure that we’re involved. I think it is the right answer. We were part of the demo with Google last week. We’re definitely doing more than dipping our toes into it.

There’s a lot of ways to build those integrations. I went to Google I/O and I watched what it called Project Mariner.

That’s right. We’re part of that.

It’s running Chrome on a data center and AI is literally clicking around the website.

That’s right, and you can see it. I would say that’s still somewhat rudimentary. I think you can do better. But again, it’s just a first step. It’s okay.

That to me seems like a Rube Goldberg machine. APIs exist. We know how to make computers and databases talk to each other. This is fully ridiculous. Then, there are new age ways of doing it, like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, where the agents have a more structured way of communicating. It’s kind of just APIs, but they’re cooler APIs.

It’s more seamless.

Which of those ways do you think is going to be the future for you? Are you just trying them all?

I think whatever is easiest for the customer is going to be the future.

Who is the customer here?

At the end of the day, it’s the people who are paying for these services. In our instance, it’s the clients who need things fixed around the home. I think whatever is easiest for them is eventually what’s going to work. I know Project Mariner kind of seems odd. You’re just watching this mouse move around.

It’s kind of eerie.

It is. But at the end of the day, it’s just the first step. I think Google is going to continue to evolve there. I don’t want to say which way is the right way because eventually, all of these platforms will build products that will make it much more seamless for the customer to get things done. We just want to make sure we’re involved.

Ania, this is great. What’s next for Taskrabbit? What should people be looking for?

We have some very fun things coming up. Ikea is a partner and has been a very successful partner. We believe we can have other very successful partners. We just rolled out a suite of products that will allow us to speak to those partners via an API much faster to ensure that their customers can come and use Taskrabbit services. So, we’re really excited about that opportunity.

The other thing that’s really big is the continued evolution of how we match a client and a Tasker. The way you may see that as a client or a Tasker on our apps is just a more seamless way to know that you’re getting the right person to do that TV mounting task on a brick wall.

I’m absolutely going to sign up for Taskrabbit to mount some TVs in my neighborhood. It feels like the thing I’m doing this afternoon.

If you love doing it, you should absolutely be doing it. You live in a neighborhood where I think there’s a lot of people mounting TVs.

There’s going to be a lot of crooked TVs here in Westchester. Thank you so much for coming on Decoder, you’re going to have to come back soon.

Thanks so much. I really enjoyed our conversation.

https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679470/taskrabbit-ceo-ania-smith-labor-gig-economy-work-ai-automation#comments,"Today, I’m talking with Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith. Taskrabbit is one of the original gig worker platforms that’s really focused on work you might need done in your home; it’s been around for nearly 20 years, and you might be surprised to know that the core product has not changed all that much. Taskers can sign up to offer services like assembling furniture, mounting TVs, and helping people move, and they get to set their own prices for that work, which makes it a more of a marketplace than something like Uber.

As you’ll hear Ania say, the difference between Taskrabbit and something like Thumbtack or Angi is that Taskrabbit manages the entire interaction from end to end — it’s not just a directory but also where people can leave reviews, get customer service, and manage all their payments.

Ania describes all this as matching supply and demand, and we talked a lot about where that supply of labor comes from and what it might mean that there are more Taskers than ever right now. That feels like a bit of a recession indicator to me — that’s a lot of people looking for additional income — but Ania had a more measured view and pointed out that there are some Taskers earning a very comfortable living on the platform.

Taskrabbit is also now notably owned by Ikea, which has a lot of interest in how the platform grows and what kinds of services it can integrate into the experience of being an Ikea customer. Assembling Ikea furniture is a core Taskrabbit service, after all, and I wanted to know if there was any pressure to specialize that service or prioritize Ikea work over other companies.

But if you’ve been listening to Decoder recently, you know that the heart of this conversation was about the next wave of user interfaces — particularly, the next wave of AI assistants that can book services like Taskrabbit, DoorDash, Uber for you. Google actually gave a demo of one of its agents going through Taskrabbit’s website a couple weeks ago, and I’m very curious how all these services are thinking about having those kinds of tools step in between them and their customers.

After all, if you’re just asking a voice assistant to get someone to help you mount a TV, you’re probably not using the Taskrabbit website yourself. That’s a big change, and Ania and I talked about it for a while — you’ll hear her say Taskrabbit’s end-to-end focus is the differentiator here and that other platforms will find it hard to compete with that.

Okay: Taskrabbit CEO Ania Smith. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Ania Smith, you are the CEO of Taskrabbit. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you for having me. Excited to be here.

I’m very excited to talk to you. It feels like there’s a lot of change coming to the service economy on our phones. There’s a lot of change in the economy in general that is interesting to talk about. Let’s start at the very beginning. TaskRabbit has been around for a while. You’ve been the CEO for about five years. How would you describe Taskrabbit today? How should people think about it?

So it’s pretty similar to what it has been. We connect people who need help around the home with a vast network of highly skilled and reliable Taskers who can help you with cleaning, mounting your TV, assembling your furniture, or a range of other tasks around the home. And I think we do that pretty well.

Taskrabbit was founded in 2008. Many things have happened since then. We’ve gone from a desktop paradigm to a mobile paradigm. Competitors have shown up. There’s Fiverr, which I think of as where you go to get a cheap logo. Do you think of Taskrabbit as expansive into digital services? You’re describing hanging TVs. Is it more of a physical services platform?

Today it is, and that’s really our focus. It is our vision to become the number one marketplace for home services specifically. There’s a lot of things to get done around the home, everything from putting down mulch and cleaning your gutters to mowing your lawn. Then there’s so much to do inside the home.

There’s also a lot to do with big moments in your life, when you think about starting a family or moving. Moving is a perfect example. You have to clean your old place, clean the new place, pack, unpack, find an actual moving service, mount TVs, assemble. So, there are a lot of use cases where these services are still very much needed.

One thing that’s interesting about that market in particular is that there’s no shortage of gardening companies, moving companies, or people on Craigslist who will hang your TV for you. There are AV installation companies at the high end. Do you want the companies who are doing customer discovery on the platform or do you want individuals?

Today we definitely focus on individuals. We’re getting to a point where half of workers in the US are actually gig economy workers. That means many things, right? Not all of them are doing furniture assembly, but many are using these platforms to find additional work and to have the flexibility to transition between different stages of life. That’s what we focus on, and those are the people who we want to help.

We’re here to provide a meaningful income to folks who need it. There are a lot of people who may be between jobs or students who have time on weekends or during the summers, and there’s a lot of opportunity to make a pretty good living on Taskrabbit. An average hourly pay is close to $50 an hour, and in some markets, it’s well over $50. So, there are a lot of great opportunities to make a meaningful income for yourself and your family.

When you say meaningful income at $50 per hour, that’s not a full-time work week at $50 an hour, right? That’s piecework. How much are people making on the high end on Taskrabbit?

We have people making well over $200,000 a year. It’s been a couple years now, but there was a Tasker I spoke with who was a student at NYU. One of his friends was moving and using Taskrabbit. He had never heard of Taskrabbit, so he looked it up. This was 2022 or 2023, and he said, “Hey, maybe I can do this while I look for a job.”

So, he got smart and figured out how to mount TVs fairly quickly just by learning it on YouTube and really optimized his jobs. He could sometimes mount as many as three TVs in an hour in Manhattan. This is all he did for his first year after graduation, and he made well over $200,000 a year.

Is that sustainable? I know a lot of people in the industry who have AV installation companies, for example. They go from that to “I’m going to design you a home theater system” to “I’m going to sell you the components of that at some high margin.” That’s how you build your business. But that’s different from “I’m going to install a lot of TVs every single day for the rest of my life.” Is something like that totally sustainable on Taskrabbit?

No, but how many people have the same job for the rest of their lives? We have Taskers who’ve been here for five, six, or 10 years, which is great. Sometimes they leave, they come back, and they leave again. It just really depends on what’s going on in their lives. We want to make sure that we provide the opportunity. If people do want to come and earn an income, we’re here to help them do that. For us, that means getting as many jobs as possible so that we can make sure our Taskers have jobs that they can do.

So, $200,000 is the high end. It’s a great, shiny number. What’s the median?

I don’t think that I know the median. It really depends on the market. There’s obviously liquidity and density questions, and it also depends on the category. Many of our Taskers are not working what you would consider full time. They are doing this as a stop measure in between gigs or just in the evenings. So, we don’t really track the median earnings because everyone has such a specific and different use case. What we think about is what are your weekly targets for earning if you want to work as much as possible in a week,and how can we help you reach those targets? We find that that’s what Taskers really resonate with.

What are the biggest markets for you?

New York City is by far our biggest market, and it has been probably since we launched there [in 2011]. But we have a lot of growth in our secondary and tertiary markets. Also, we’re now in eight countries. London has become a huge market for us, which is really exciting to see. Toronto is a big market as well. Obviously, the Bay Area is still our home, and so we have really great brand equity there. LA is a big market. We’re now in hundreds and hundreds of cities across the globe. It’s fun since sometimes we get into competitions to see which city can grow faster, but they all have different trajectories.

Is the action mostly in cities?

Today, yes. As you know, we’re owned by Ikea, so we also definitely think a lot about how we can support the Ikea business and support Ikea customers who want their furniture to be assembled and delivered. In the US, we also do delivery for Ikea, and so we make sure that we can cover all Ikea stores. Most of them are not located in urban city centers, and they’re much bigger in Europe. So, a market like Germany has 50 to 60 stores, which is the same as the number of stores in the US but the US is triple or quadruple the size of Germany. It’s much more densely populated, and we want to make sure that we cover all the Ikea markets.

I want to come back to the Ikea relationship because I think that is super interesting. It’s been several years now and I’m very curious how that has developed. But I want to stay focused on the cities for one second. I lived in New York City for a long time. Now I live in the suburbs. When I moved to the suburbs, I just started buying more and more tools. It’s just a thing that happens when you move to the suburbs. I didn’t have the space to have a bunch of tools and capabilities in my apartment in New York City. Is that why there are bigger markets in the cities? People just don’t have the stuff or the skills?

I think it has to do a lot with market density and liquidity. You want to be closer to the jobs, but I would say the suburbs are our fastest growing markets overall compared to cities because there is just a lot of opportunity. When we moved to the suburbs, my husband was also very keen to buy tools and start doing work around the house, and that didn’t turn out very well for us. Maybe it turns out well for others, but we still have Taskers here quite often because there’s just a lot of work to do. You have more square footage, and by definition, every single additional square foot will require more work. So, we see a lot of potential in the suburbs as well.

One of the things that is interesting to me about the broader economy, as you’re describing it, is the people who want to fill their time with work. They want to make more money and see the opportunity and that liquidity in the market. But that supply of effort requires time, right? People’s time isn’t being filled with their full-time jobs. They’re between jobs or they might be out of a job. Do you see a correlation between the health of the overall economy and the Tasker supply?

We do. For around the last three years, we’ve definitely seen more supply than we can handle on the platform. We now have waitlists in many cities because we don’t want to onboard a Tasker and then not be able to provide them with jobs. It’s sort of a false premise. I want to make sure that if you are on our platform, there’s work for you to do. As the economy has changed over the last few years — especially over the last couple of years as we’ve seen a bit more struggle — we’ve had thousands and thousands of Taskers applying every year. It’s 15 to 20 percent more than the year before.

Does that feel like a recession indicator to you?

I’m not an economist, and I read all of this stuff just like you do. If you do read that stuff, we should’ve had a recession last year and one the year before, and those predictions turn out to be wrong. So, I think the word is “uncertainty.” We just don’t know because at least over the last two years, we understood what was going on a little bit more.

There’s just a lot of uncertainty overall. It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen with tariffs, with bond yields, with interest rates, with the housing market. All I can say is we see an increase in Tasker applications. I’m not sure that that’s an indication that a recession is coming.

Do you see an increase in the number of people who are buying services from Taskrabbit? Because that’s the other side of the equation. Is demand also going up?

Demand is going up, and that’s great to see. There’s a bit of a caveat to that, and it’s not just Taskrabbit. There are, as you mentioned, multiple players. For all of us, demand is going up. We’re still such a small portion of the overall market and its overall possibilities. Most people still assemble their own furniture, put up their own TVs, and clean their own houses. Even though we see a lot of growth, there’s still so much opportunity to continue growing. Even after 10 to 15 years, it still feels like the market is quite nascent and services are still hard to figure out. There’s a lot to think about, especially when it comes to how we match the perfect Tasker to the client.

I talk a lot about mounting. We have thousands of Taskers who can mount your TV, which is great, but can they be available on a Friday evening, mount it on a brick wall, and know how to hide the cables? That’s a different skill than mounting a smaller TV on a normal wall. There’s a lot of variables that go into an actual perfect job, and we still have a lot of work to do there. So, there’s still a lot of growth opportunity.

I love that we’re talking about mounting TVs so much because that’s totally my wheelhouse, and The Verge audience knows that. I love talking about mounting TVs. This is great. We’re just in the strike zone for me.

How do you get that data? How do you evaluate who is good at mounting a TV above a fireplace versus just on a regular piece of drywall?

There are many ways. First of all, we now have AI models and tools that help us do this even faster, but the Taskers themselves tell us what capabilities they have, and we ask pretty structured questions and they can actually explain. But the bigger piece of data comes from their experience on the platform and having done similar tasks previously.

So if they tell us that they hung up this type of TV, we can use that data to match them to exactly that kind of job again. Of course, the clients provide reviews, so we can search automatically just with words, and there’s then structured data and understanding their skill set. We take that all into consideration as we build out a more optimal match.

There’s a relationship there between what customers are saying, the reviews they’re leaving, whether they validate the skills, and the rates that Taskers can charge. Is that a correlation you can measure?

Taskers do set their own rates, which makes us very different from many of the other platforms that you see in the market. It’s why so many Taskers actually love coming to Taskrabbit. If I had to summarize, they fully recognize how to set their rates, so we provide a lot of guidance to them. We take into consideration where you are based, what types of tasks you perform, your previous reviews. And then based on what the market is doing, we have a rate we could potentially suggest. They don’t take our suggestions all the time, which is fine. They get to set their own rate.

To bring it back to TV mounting — again, my favorite topic — you could pay less money for someone with fewer reviews and take on more risk that they might not know what they’re doing. Or you might pay more money for someone who appears to know what they’re doing.

That feels like a pricing strategy that should exist on the platform. Whenever we talk about the gig economy, I get workers emailing us saying, “I just want to know how to make more money.” It feels like on Taskrabbit, the best way to do it is to just charge more because they can set the rates.

Of course, they can set the rates, but if they charge too much, the market is not going to reward them in a way they might want. So, you can definitely set your rates higher than what the market is willing to bear. If you’re in a market where there are thousands of other Taskers, that’ll manifest itself on the platform by having you essentially get fewer jobs if you’re pricing much higher than what clients are willing to pay.

Do you see that rates go up over time for an individual Tasker or in aggregate?

Rates are going up in aggregate. They definitely have ebbed and flowed. It also matters a lot on the markets. Certain markets are obviously much higher than other markets. As we see trends with inflation and what’s going on externally, the rates tend to follow because even supplies are becoming more expensive for Taskers. Then, their lives are becoming more expensive, so they need to charge more as well. So we do see, in aggregate, rates moving up.

Do you know the categories where rates have gone up the highest?

It really depends. Moving is one of our highest categories in terms of rates just because it’s a more complex product. You can take hours to help someone move. In terms of total job number, that’s obviously one of the higher ones. If you look at per hour numbers, it really varies by market. There isn’t a single trend.

Then in aggregate, the rates across the platform are going up as well?

Yes.

If I’m an individual Tasker there for five years, is it generally true that I can just charge more over time because I have more reviews and more data to back up that I know what I’m doing?

I don’t think that’s generally true because if you have a lot more supply in that market, you’re competing all the time. You can’t just assume that you’re going to be able to raise your rates over time. When people start up, it’s a bit similar to Airbnb. When you’re a brand new host, you come in and you have no reviews and no ratings. You want people to stay in your home and you want to do a good job, so you may price a bit lower just to make sure that you show up in search results and that people book your place.

As you gain more experience, understand what your guests want, provide those things for them, and you continue to get really great reviews and really great feedback, you’re able to raise the prices. But there’s a limit as more and more Airbnbs show up in that market. So, there are many components that help you figure out how to price, and Airbnb, just like Taskrabbit, also helps hosts figure out what the right pricing schematic could be. But it’s definitely not just a science.

Airbnb is a perfect example because it lets people set rates and it has all kinds of pricing tools. The other end is Uber, which doesn’t let anyone set a price. If you’re the best Uber driver or the worst, it kind of doesn’t matter. Uber is just pricing for you. That dynamic has led to a lot of frustration over there.

It seems like the challenge in your case is that if you get good enough, get famous enough, and you’ve had enough customers, you might leave the platform. You can just do more effective marketing and take a higher margin on your own. How do you make sure you don’t have that graduation problem?

I mean you could, but it’s not just about marketing. That’s one of the biggest services that we provide, but it’s also about scheduling. It’s also about providing some level of protection so if things go wrong, we’re there to help, and to provide consistent work. So yes, you can leave the platform and try to do this on your own. We hope that we provide such great service to our Taskers that it’s harder for them to manage outside of the platform.

For example, if you’re working on multiple platforms or doing it on your own, you’re managing your own Google Calendar. It’s really hard to sync them all and think about how to manage your time appropriately. We can help do that for you. We can help figure it out and make sure that the tasks we’re providing are the ones most matched to your skill set because we understand your history and we understand what the client wants. We can make sure that the tasks that are visible to you are the ones that are closer to your home.

So, there are a lot of additional services and benefits that we provide to the Taskers where they want to stay on a platform because it’s easier for them. Also, if they set a rate of $100 per hour, they get to take home $100, which is very different from some of the other platforms.

Walk me through that. What’s the revenue model for you? How do you make your money?

We make our money just like many platforms do, where we have to charge either one or both sides of the marketplace for the services we provide. I just explained some of the services for Taskers. We also provide a lot of services to the clients. The way things work on our platform for clients is when they book a job, they pay an additional service fee to Taskrabbit for everything from quality assurance and fraud to just being able to find the Tasker.

You’re saying these people have been vetted. They actually know how to hang the TV.

Exactly.

There’s a lot of temptation in every marketplace like this to charge both sides. Why not charge the Taskers?

To be fair, we haven’t tried this. We haven’t experimented with this at least since I’ve been here. I believe this has been tested previously. I think that the Taskers themselves are keen to provide the best service that they can, and we want to make sure that we are a supply-based marketplace. As you well know, this thing doesn’t work without supply, and you kind of have to start with supply.

For me and for Taskrabbit, it’s really important that we have the best quality supply, and we don’t need to be charging the Taskers for that. We don’t use a lead gen model. We are instead making sure that the entire job gets booked from the very beginning. We’re there to hold it together with the client and the Tasker all the way through to payment as opposed to just giving a client a few names and saying, “Go try them out.” So, we believe that the service we’re providing is ensuring that the job happens and it’s high quality. For that, we primarily charge the client.

You’ve made a distinction here between what you call lead gen platforms where they charge for demand. You’re a plumber, you want to get some customers, you would charge some service to get you some customers. Describe what you mean by lead gen and how Taskrabbit is different.

So I’ll just talk about what Taskrabbit does and then perhaps compare it a bit to what other platforms do. Taskrabbit allows you to book a Tasker on a platform. I guess one word to think about what we do is “shepherd” this process all the way through. So, we make sure that the Tasker shows up, that the task actually gets done, and then we collect payment from you and the client. We then distribute that payment to the Tasker, make sure that you can write the review for the Tasker, and so on.

There’s just a whole slew of things that happen, including the fact that if something goes wrong, you can pick up the phone and call or you can send us a message and say, “Hey, the Tasker’s late,” or, “The Tasker canceled, what should I do next?” That’s different than just getting the names of three or four potential providers and forcing you as a client to call each of them and start negotiating on a price or the time before the person comes and does whatever task. If something goes wrong, it’s really just between you and that provider. With us, we’re there all the way through until the job closes.

When you say you’re not a lead gen model, that feels really important. That’s a principle that you need to hold onto because every other company that’s similarly situated does sort of charge both sides. Substack, for example, takes 10 percent of everyone’s earnings just to send emails. It would tell you it does a lot more than just send emails,

But it has a graduation problem. People leave the platform because you can get cheaper email distribution elsewhere. Substack has to build new services in order to justify its 10 percent for its highest-volume writers. You don’t have that problem. Does that pressure just not exist or does that pressure exist and you keep it away?

Of course it exists. So Taskers definitely leave the platform, and clients leave the platform.

Sorry, I meant the pressure to charge both sides of the marketplace.

No because again, I really feel that we don’t need to charge the Taskers to make the money that we make. We provide enough services to both sides, but the client is willing to bear that cost and that has worked for us. It doesn’t mean that it’s always going to work and that our models and the way we match are always going to be the same. We’re constantly experimenting. We are looking at other ways with many of the components that we’re talking about because we have to continue evolving. But right now, this works for us. So today, we don’t see changing the model to charge Taskers.

I think that brings me to Ikea. So Ikea bought Taskrabbit in 2017. It’s a complicated transaction, but the upshot is Ikea now owns Taskrabbit. Do you think it’s that ownership that protects you from the pressure to increase revenue by charging both sides of the marketplace? I feel like if you were a public company you might feel that pressure much more keenly.

It may be. I don’t know. I’ve never been a CEO of a public company. I can tell you that we have pretty big goals and high pressure from Ikea. Obviously, there is a component of stability that comes with having Ikea as a parent, and there are good and bad things about this. The good thing is we are not a public company nor VC-funded, and I don’t have to worry about how things are going to evolve financially in the same way.

But that can make you a bit more complacent. So we’re trying hard to ensure that we have very ambitious goals and a very big vision so that the teams work really hard to continue to grow. There are many ways that we can drive the business forward, actually build growth capabilities. Charging Taskers is not one of them, but there are many other ways where we think we have a lot of opportunity in terms of growth.

Let me ask you the big Decoder question here, which is expressed in two ways. First, how is Taskrabbit structured inside of Ikea? How does that work?

Well, we operate very independently inside of Ikea. I report to a board and the board is made up of Ikea executives and external board members. We have three board meetings a year because Ikea works in tertials, not quarters.

That’s very Ikea to make up its own complicated Swedish word. It’s perfect.

It’s so Ikea, but it works for me. So, we meet three times a year, we set targets together, and that’s it. Now, I do work very closely with Ikea in a different way — more in a business sense — where there was a lot of opportunity to ensure that Ikea customers have access to Taskrabbit. In some sense, Taskrabbit customers have access to Ikea, but Ikea has millions of people visiting its apps, its sites, and, of course, its big stores. We want to make sure that we have access to those customers in the best way possible.

So, we’ve done some great things there. Just recently in the US — but we had done so elsewhere before — we made it so that it’s much more seamless for Ikea customers to purchase, let’s say, a desk and assembly all at the same time and pay for it at Ikea checkout versus having to go separately to the Taskrabbit app, try to put in the very fun Ikea furniture names, and then try to figure out how to get it assembled. That’s a great example of how the two companies can really leverage their capabilities.

At the end of the day, Ikea purchased Taskrabbit under the premise that there are some potential Ikea customers who don’t want to be Ikea customers because they feel overwhelmed by the idea of putting together furniture. We want to be there to help to solve that problem, and I think we’ve done a very good job there.

Let me connect that to the supply conversation we were just having. I’ve put together a lot of Ikea furniture in my day. I feel like I’m pretty good at it. That’s a relatively specialized skill. Reading an Ikea instruction manual is like learning another language in many ways.

I think it depends who you ask. Some people are really good at this.

By the way, one of my dream stories is that we go to a conference of flat-pack furniture designers and the Ikea people come in dressed all in black and everyone’s like, “It’s the Ikea designers.” It’s obviously the easiest to put together, but it’s like a whole ecosystem.

It’s a whole thing. But I can tell you, watching our Taskers put together Ikea furniture, it is impressive. They know the furniture, so they can do this so well inside and out. They just do it with such speed. You may be good, but you’re never going to be an Ikea Tasker who is doing this day in and day out.

That’s kind of what I’m getting at. It’s a specialized skill. I would actually say putting together Ikea furniture is different than putting together the furniture you would buy at Target or Walmart. They’re different companies with different styles. The way that things fit together is literally different.

Again, my dream story is that we find rival flat-pack design gangs and put them head to head. I don’t know if that’s how it works, it’s just how it works in my brain. That’s a specialized supply. Do you keep that pool aside and say, “These are the people who are best at assembling Ikea kitchens and we’re going to make sure they’re available to Ikea”?

They get to choose. I would say the majority of the Taskers who assemble Ikea furniture are also really good at assembling furniture from Wayfair, Target, and other places. They want to assemble furniture. The way it works on our platform is there’s an Ikea assembly furniture category because, like you said, it’s specialized, but then there’s just furniture assembly where it could be a piece from anywhere. Those Taskers definitely cross.

Many of them are also handymen, so they will do minor home repairs, like if your doorknob is loose. They have great skills. Some of them want to just focus only on Ikea furniture, but I would say that’s the minority. Many of them cross into multiple categories.

Because Ikea is a parent, do you reserve supply or is that just not a problem?

It’s just not a problem in all the countries that we serve. I alluded to this earlier, but Ikea is much bigger in Europe, so a larger portion of our Taskers know how to assemble Ikea furniture in Europe versus the US because we get a lot more Ikea jobs in Europe. The Ikea business is just much stronger over there. So no, we don’t keep them separate. We let them choose whatever category they want. We do not have any challenges with finding supply though, even in Europe.

You mentioned that Ikea has its own pressures on you and its own goals for Taskrabbit. What are those goals?

The goals are always about growth. How do we continue to grow faster and how do we continue to evolve where we’re solving the right problems for the overall customer and the Ikea customer? We just recently acquired a delivery company here in the US that does delivery of big and bulky things so that we can help Ikea deliver furniture to your home.

It wants to make sure that we are able to expand to other countries. We’re only in eight countries, while Ikea is in dozens of countries, so there’s still a lot of opportunity for growth that way. So, there are definitely pressures, but they’re similar to what any other parent or investor would have.

And then there’s Taskrabbit itself. How many people is Taskrabbit?

Right now, we’re nearly 500 folks.

How is that structured?

So, we are structured like many other companies. Today, we’re very functionally focused with a matrix overlay. We have [general managers] looking over the US market and GMs looking over the European market and each country. There’s always a bit of tension… or I would say maybe not a bit. I would like there to be a bit, there’s probably a lot of tension between some of the needs that are unique per market or per country versus having fully functional ways of thinking about the problems.

As an example, there are different competitive pressures in different markets, and there are different ways that customers go onto platforms and book their tasks. There are specific needs that customers in France have that are not applicable to the market in the US. How do we make that tradeoff? France is a much smaller overall portion of our business than the US, but you have to continue growing across the world. So, there’s definitely healthy tension across there.

Put that into practice. What Taskrabbit makes most of all is a software product. You say that customers in France have needs that customers in the US don’t have. What are those needs and how do they get expressed in the product?

For example, there is some local tax law in France that allows customers who do work on their house to get some tax benefit, which is a great thing. This isn’t something we have in the US, and so we want to make sure that customers have access to that. But to do that, you have to build out a different flow and allow them to be able to submit whatever tax documents that say that this is the work they’ve done. There’s dozens of these examples across markets.

Marketing campaigns also have to be different because people are different in every market, and they resonate with different types of themes and creative. How do we go broad but also have local capabilities? That ends up causing tension across the world, and that’s what makes it fun. Certainly we don’t have it figured out yet.

My joke on Decoder is if you tell me the structure of your company, I can tell you 80 percent of the problems. If you tell me you’re functional with a hybrid overlay, I can definitely tell you 80 percent of the problems.

Here’s the thing: I’ve gone through that a lot, but there is no perfect structure. If there was one, then we would all be doing that, and we wouldn’t have to have this conversation. If you have a functional structure, it creates certain sets of problems. You can sort of fix them by going to a GM or a business unit structure. Then, unsurprisingly, you create other sets of problems. So, to me, it is not so much about the structure. It’s much more about the skills and capabilities that people have, the incentives, and how they are uniquely positioned to work across boundaries, functions, or geographies. That’s much harder to do.

It really comes back to culture. What are our values and how do we get people to really think and row in the same direction, whatever the strategy may be? Those are the bigger problems, and I don’t think that changing the structure gets you closer to an answer. I think these types of adaptive problems are more difficult to solve and are actually more challenging. I don’t think changing structure is the answer.

Maybe one of the hottest quiet debates on the show over the past few months is whether or not structure is a proxy for culture. You seem to be very much in the line that it’s not. We’ve had some opposite answers, but it feels like the split to me is whether you have multiple kinds of businesses you’re running or you have one core product.

Once you end up in the multiple lines of business, the structure starts to reflect very different kinds of tensions and tradeoffs. Do you think that Taskrabbit has just one core business, or do you have multiple lines of business that you’re trying to operate?

Historically, it’s been one core business, but it’s definitely separate from the delivery piece. There are many different things that we need to think about. We need to think about A to B, which we didn’t have to think about before. We need to think about how to locate all sorts of components that are different from our core business. Still, it’s really important to us. We think it’s a great opportunity that is very connected to the moving business.

We are thinking a lot about what that means. Do we have a separate moving business business unit and what does that look like? Again, at the end of the day, it’s not so much about structure. It’s much more about the culture, how we can feel a sense of shared responsibility across the company, understanding what our priorities are, and what our vision and strategy are. Is it all aligned? Are we all able to row in the same direction? Is it very clear? Have we set the right expectations? These, again, are things that I think are more difficult to answer.

The other big question to ask everybody on Decoder is about decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

I know there are many different answers here. I think there are different ways to describe them — one-way doors are decisions that I’m sure you’ve heard of — but the things that are really hard to reverse. So, closing down the office during COVID, reopening an office, or acquiring a company.

These are bigger decisions, but I really trust my team and then think a lot about how they are empowering their teams to make their own decisions. I spend a lot of my time with customers. I think it’s really important, whether it’s having Taskers at my house or spending a lot of time interviewing Taskers or clients. But day to day, I’m not as close to the problem as the people who I want to have the authority or the agency to solve those problems. They are hopefully spending much more time with the customer than even I am and understanding that specific problem much better than my team and I do.

For me, it’s really important to empower the team to make decisions. You have to test and try. The thing that we keep focusing on is making decisions quickly because the speed is what gets you behind. You can constantly be looking for more data and more certainty, and most of that doesn’t exist. You have to start using your gut — your instinct or however you define that — to look at your past experience. You have some pattern recognition. You kind of understand how things may go, you weigh them, and you make a call. Doing that quicker is the most important thing.

You just described being close to the customer. It’s interesting. Your history at Uber is as the head of courier operations, right?

That’s right.

You were on the supply side working with the courier.

Same with Airbnb. I definitely have a soft spot for the supply side of the business. Frankly, this is why I am doing the gig economy. When I was younger, my family and I emigrated from Poland. In the ‘80s, my parents were trying to find jobs with more hours. It was all hourly work, and it was hard to make ends meet. I often wish that these types of platforms existed then because no matter what, you can hustle and make more money. I definitely can relate to the supply side of the business a lot more.

How do you make sure that the Taskers are happy? If everyone is doing this kind of work because they’re not making enough money, there’s sort of an inherent unhappiness there. How do you make sure that they are happy and enthusiastic about doing this instead of having to do it because the economy is in turmoil?

I don’t know if the premise that Taskers are unhappy is right.

I think the premise that supply is increasing because the economy is in turmoil is kind of bearing itself out.

Correct. But I’ll tell you, I have Taskers showing up at my house every month or week, and these are people who are really striving to make an incremental income or their main income. They love having the opportunity to use their skills to do something or to help someone else while making a pretty good wage, generally speaking. Like I’ve said, we’ve done a lot of things. We try to provide a lot of additional benefits for them. We try to help them and make sure that they can call us.

We have a whole team that is focused just on helping Taskers make money. This team will help you think about how you set prices, think about the categories you’re in, how you can make sure that your write-up is correct, and so on. We’re providing a lot of AI tools for Taskers to do that as well, but having that human interaction really helps. So, if you’re here on our platform and you want to make money, there’s an opportunity to make money. We want to be the people who help them do that.

I’m very curious about what you have Taskers at your house to do every couple of weeks. How many TVs are you hanging up Ania?

[Laughs] No, it’s not TVs. Don’t tell my husband this because he still pretends that he can do these things, but he really doesn’t. He doesn’t notice that it’s broken and he doesn’t notice that it’s now fixed. The house just runs. This is okay.

I had someone come in here the other day and mount a bunch of pictures in my son’s room. I had someone come in to assemble furniture, like these bookcases behind me. I had someone come to help with my lawn. There’s an infinite number of ways to get someone to help you in your home.

What have you learned about your own platform that you wanted to improve by using it as much as you do?

So much. Make it simpler. Always make it simpler. Make it easier. I may not care to choose who the Tasker is. I just want to make sure that it’s going to be a person who can do the job really well, and I want to do it as affordably as I can. So sometimes, it would be appreciated to have a bit more help in choosing. So, we’re working on that.

You’ve mentioned AI several times. I’ve been asking basically everyone what happens when you have agents and more capable assistants built into your phones. I keep calling this the “DoorDash problem,” but you could call it the “Taskrabbit problem” or the “Uber problem.” The idea that I could just tell Siri, “I need to get a TV hung up,” and then Siri goes off, clicks around the apps for me, and brings a Tasker to my house is very powerful.

There are a lot of companies attempting to build their way towards that goal. Google just announced a bunch of stuff, Microsoft just announced a bunch of stuff. That would disintermediate you, right? At the end of the day, you would just become a commoditized service provider to an assistant that might be collecting all the user interaction and own the customer relationship. Have you looked forward to that problem? Do you know how you want to address it?

I absolutely look forward to the problem. I look at it a little bit differently. If those agents exist, you have to go to where the customer is. We have people that come to our sites every day, but if people want to go to Ikea and book a Tasker via Ikea, we’re not going to say no. If they want to go to Target and do that, we’re not going to say no. If they want to go to Siri and do that, we’re not going to say no. It’s very easy to fall into thinking, “I don’t own the customer” and “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the customer.”

But the customer will know that this is a Tasker, or we can make sure that they know that this is a Tasker. They can understand that they’re working with another party, and they can come back directly or they don’t have to. Then, there will be some economic way to figure out a system where it works for both parties. Siri, in this case, wants to be able to provide these types of services, and they can’t really do it without Taskrabbit because only Taskrabbit actually has a network of thousands of Taskers. We cultivated that network. We know who they are and we understand their skills. They’ve all been background checked.

Siri, Apple, or whoever is not going to do that. They’re just not going to be able to do that. We will always have the strength and supply, and we will continue to go where the customer is to make sure as many of them have access to our platform as possible.

Isn’t that the story of the internet though? Isn’t it the companies and the platforms that have the strength and demand that get to set the terms?

I think it’s a bit different when you look at a gig economy marketplace. At the end of the day, it takes a lot of work to bring together a set of Taskers or hosts or Uber drivers. It’s really hard to acquire these folks and to make sure that they provide the quality that you want, and I don’t see other companies being able to do that.

I also think it’s too early. There are so many ways to test this and how to make it work. The example that you provided, we’re still not quite there. There are many situations where it sounds great, but there are many that are still hindered from actually being a seamless experience. There’s payments, logging in, accounts, and all sorts of ways that all of this can and will be resolved. But that gives us a chance to test a lot of different models and understand what works best for the Tasker, for the client, and in this case, for the two parties involved.

I’m with you that it hasn’t been proven to work, but I also go to the events and watch Amazon executives demonstrate the next version of Alexa and it books an appointment on Thumbtack when the dishwasher is broken. I can see how you want Taskrabbit in that mix, but then you are next to Thumbtack and the agent might just pick the lowest price, especially if you’re charging the customer. You might just pick the service you were told about.

Look, we’re very different from Thumbtack because Thumbtack is a lead gen product that is very hard to close, whereas we provide the experience all the way through. In the demo that you described, the client still has to go and work with whoever the end provider is. In this case, it’s someone to fix your dishwasher. This isn’t something that we have to do. Our product would look very different because we are able to shepherd the entire experience through.

You close the loop. You actually send the task to the Tasker.

We close the loop, but again, we’re still quite far from where that could go. I think the possibilities are endless, and we have to go where the customer is. If everyone all of a sudden goes and talks to the phone and that’s how they order things or talk to Siri, I don’t know how we would not be there.

Do you think it’s different because you are not a lead gen model? I think about Thumbtack, for example. At some point, it’s just there to deliver demand to a bunch of HVAC technicians or whoever was in that demonstration. Maybe Siri delivers that demand, and Thumbtack gets totally disintermediated. You’re saying that’s not your model and you’re not worried about it, and you’re charging the customer anyway. So would you just charge a higher rate for an agent to solve the problem?

There are so many different economic structures that can work here. We’re in the very early stages. We may all think and guesstimate that this is the right structure, and then at year end we can decide, “Wow, this doesn’t work for us, the third party, or the client. We’re not getting enough people to actually do this.” There’s a lot of trial and error here, and it’s too early to be saying, “This is the right model and this is the right structure.”

What are the most promising early flashes you’ve seen?

I think the concept of having an agent do things for you is very interesting. If you take it a lot further, eventually in theory, we won’t even have laptops, our Kindles, or whatever. We might just have agents constantly doing things for us on other types of devices. I think it’s super exciting to be a part of that journey, but I think none of it has been proven and we’re still actually pretty far away. Although technology is changing so quickly. It’s quite remarkable to watch. It’s quite remarkable to be alive during this time.

I go to all the demos and I have the same reaction as you, which is, “Does this actually work?” They’re very convincing demos.

They are. I was just at a conference where someone was adamantly telling me that it’ll only be three years before a robot can hang up a TV.

I don’t believe that for a second.

I don’t believe that. I just don’t.

I have hung up a lot of TVs.

This person was very adamant. Anytime that I’m hearing about any work that is being done in a physical space, it’s still really far away. They’re working on having robots try to empty the dishwasher, and that’s a complex task. It’s really complex when you really think about it. There’s a lot that still has to happen.

One of the things that I’m thinking about a lot is where does automation come and where does it go? Taskrabbit doesn’t seem easily automatable from the jump, as you’re describing it. A lot of these tasks are really, really hard for robotics to begin to try to solve, like hanging a TV or emptying the dishwasher. Many rounds of innovation have to happen to make that viable.

But for other similarly situated competitors or peers you have like Uber, you can see how automation will change their business. The cars will drive themselves. That’s going to change the business in radical ways, and we’ll see how that goes. Do you see any automation that might change how Taskrabbit works in the near future?

From a software platform perspective? One hundred percent. But in the context of what happens in someone’s home? I really don’t see a robot mowing the lawn just yet. But it will happen.

We just reviewed a bunch of robotic lawnmowers that you can buy and they don’t work very well.

Right. They don’t work very well. The internet didn’t work very well whenever it started. The cellphones we had didn’t work very well. So, it will evolve, but I think we’re still quite far away.

On the software side, what do you see that’s going to change?

For Taskrabbit, how we optimize the match between the client and Tasker is going to change. We can get so much smarter. I think how clients will come to our platform will change. Just the basics of how SEO and SEM work. Those terms will barely apply [in the future], and that will happen much sooner than a robot hanging up your TV. I think that pace of that change is much more accelerated.

Do you think that’s where the growth is going to come from?

Absolutely.

When you talk to one of the car companies, they think all their growth is coming from the cars driving themselves. They can see the massive margins that come from getting rid of the drivers. But you don’t have that opportunity.

Not yet. I understand their point. It’s pretty remarkable to take a Waymo in San Francisco. I was at Walmart many years ago, and Walmart’s offices are right across the street from YouTube. After YouTube became part of Google, there were a lot of self-driving cars — they were not called Waymos then — driving around, and they looked so foreign. Obviously, they had [test] drivers in them. And now look at it. So, this will happen. I understand the excitement. I just think we’re further away from that in home services.

Have you had any conversations with the big AI companies about being a provider to their would-be agent platforms?

We are continually exploring our options.

That’s the only non-answer you’ve given so far and I appreciate it. Does Ikea have a plan to build some great agent? Ikea has had many software platforms of its own over the years.

I’m not sure, so I don’t want to put words in their mouth. I know that AI is a critical investment and that it’s looking at it in all parts of the business, but I wouldn’t know exactly where it sees the most innovation.

When I talked to Dara Khosrowshahi from Uber about what I keep calling the “DoorDash problem,” he said, “Look, at first we’re going to build it and we’ll see if it works. If it’s cool and if it works, we’re going to charge high rates to make our business work, or maybe we’ll come to some other arrangement.” That was basically his point of view.

I think that’s a great answer.

So, you’re tracking there? Let’s just see if this is cool?

Absolutely. Let’s make sure that we’re involved. I think it is the right answer. We were part of the demo with Google last week. We’re definitely doing more than dipping our toes into it.

There’s a lot of ways to build those integrations. I went to Google I/O and I watched what it called Project Mariner.

That’s right. We’re part of that.

It’s running Chrome on a data center and AI is literally clicking around the website.

That’s right, and you can see it. I would say that’s still somewhat rudimentary. I think you can do better. But again, it’s just a first step. It’s okay.

That to me seems like a Rube Goldberg machine. APIs exist. We know how to make computers and databases talk to each other. This is fully ridiculous. Then, there are new age ways of doing it, like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, where the agents have a more structured way of communicating. It’s kind of just APIs, but they’re cooler APIs.

It’s more seamless.

Which of those ways do you think is going to be the future for you? Are you just trying them all?

I think whatever is easiest for the customer is going to be the future.

Who is the customer here?

At the end of the day, it’s the people who are paying for these services. In our instance, it’s the clients who need things fixed around the home. I think whatever is easiest for them is eventually what’s going to work. I know Project Mariner kind of seems odd. You’re just watching this mouse move around.

It’s kind of eerie.

It is. But at the end of the day, it’s just the first step. I think Google is going to continue to evolve there. I don’t want to say which way is the right way because eventually, all of these platforms will build products that will make it much more seamless for the customer to get things done. We just want to make sure we’re involved.

Ania, this is great. What’s next for Taskrabbit? What should people be looking for?

We have some very fun things coming up. Ikea is a partner and has been a very successful partner. We believe we can have other very successful partners. We just rolled out a suite of products that will allow us to speak to those partners via an API much faster to ensure that their customers can come and use Taskrabbit services. So, we’re really excited about that opportunity.

The other thing that’s really big is the continued evolution of how we match a client and a Tasker. The way you may see that as a client or a Tasker on our apps is just a more seamless way to know that you’re getting the right person to do that TV mounting task on a brick wall.

I’m absolutely going to sign up for Taskrabbit to mount some TVs in my neighborhood. It feels like the thing I’m doing this afternoon.

If you love doing it, you should absolutely be doing it. You live in a neighborhood where I think there’s a lot of people mounting TVs.

There’s going to be a lot of crooked TVs here in Westchester. Thank you so much for coming on Decoder, you’re going to have to come back soon.

Thanks so much. I really enjoyed our conversation.

This year’s developer conference is coming to a close, but most years the last one is the biggest one: Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, when the company announces its software plans for the year to come. This year feels different, though. Apple is reportedly planning a redesign that will touch all its operating systems, and a new naming scheme to tie them all more closely together. Is that enough for a company under this much pressure? Regulators are changing the way Apple’s business works; developers continue to be frustrated with Apple’s rules and machinations; competitors are leaving Apple’s AI efforts behind. So what does Apple really need to show, and prove, at WWDC?

On this episode of The Vergecast, Nilay, David, and The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern talk through everything we’re expecting at WWDC — and all the things we’re not expecting. (Here’s a good MacRumors rundown of it all.) We’re likely to hear more about AI integrations, and more ways developers can access those integrations. We might hear a lot about Shortcuts. Will we see more multitasking options, both on the iPhone and iPad? Will your AirPods turn into remote camera shutters? Can AI fix your battery life? Rumors are flying, and as ever we won’t know for sure until Monday.

After that, we turn to the other big gadget news of the week: the Nintendo Switch 2. David explains his oddly easy experience getting one, and the hosts talk through the current vibes around the launch. We’ll have lots more to say once we’ve been able to thoroughly test the new device, too, so stay tuned. There’s also some news this week about Meta’s smart glasses plans, and Joanna has a theory about what Jony Ive and OpenAI are working on.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another round of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, plus some small but interesting fediverse news.

https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube,"Today, I’m talking with Runway CEO and cofounder Cris Valenzuela. This one’s special: Cris and I were live at an event in New York City last month hosted by Alix Partners, so you’ll hear the audience in the background from time to time.

Runway is one of the leading AI video generation platforms. The basic concept is familiar by now: you start with a reference image — either something you’ve created using Runway’s own model or something you upload — you type in a prompt, and Runway spits out a fully formed video sequence.

But what’s most interesting to me about Runway is that while the AI hype is at a fever pitch right now, there’s a little more depth to the company. Cris founded the company back in 2018, so he’s been through some boom-and-bust periods in AI, and you’ll hear that experience come through as we talk about the technology and what it can and can’t do. When Cris began to more seriously explore AI video generation, as a researcher at New York University, we still mostly referred to AI as “machine learning,” and you’ll hear him recount how primitive the technology was back then compared to now.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

That said, the AI hype really is out of control, and Runway is on the same collision course with creators, artists, and copyright law as every other part of the AI industry — and you’ll hear Cris and I really get into all that here.

One theme you’ll hear Cris come back to again and again in this conversation is that he does not see Runway as a disruptive outsider to filmmaking, but rather as an active participant in the art. He sees Runway as a tool that will bring filmmaking and other forms of artistic expression to many more people, and not as an apocalyptic force that’s going to hit Hollywood like a wrecking ball.

You’ll hear him say Runway is working with many of the biggest movie studios — publicly, it has already struck a deal with Lionsgate and AMC Networks. In the AMC announcement, Cris said embracing AI video generation was a “make-or-break moment” for every entertainment company.

But cozying up to Hollywood doesn’t mean Runway is off the hook in the AI vs. art debate. In fact, Runway itself is part of an ongoing class-action lawsuit over the use of artistic works in AI training data. Last year, it was revealed Runway had trained on huge swaths of copyrighted YouTube material, including The Verge’s own YouTube channel.

So I asked Cris as plainly as I could whether Runway had in fact trained on YouTube and how the industry might survive a world where all these companies are made to pay substantial amounts of money to creators if even one of these big AI copyright lawsuits doesn’t break their way. I think you’ll find our discussion on this to be pretty candid, and Cris articulated some of his own defenses for how the AI industry has approached this topic and what might happen next.

It’s Decoder, so of course we also talked about Runway’s structure. Cris has a lot to say about Runway functioning as a research lab, and the tension that exists between releasing and refining real products and then putting them into the hands of professionals, all while working on new models and tools that might make the current tech obsolete.

Okay: Runway CEO Cris Valenzuela. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

You started Runway before the big AI boom. We were joking earlier that the URL is Runway.ml because people were calling it machine learning before. What’s changed since the boom in that approach? Have you had to rethink, “Okay, everyone understands what training a model is now, and the market for GPUs is more expensive.” What are the changes?

A lot has changed. I think we started the company in 2018. Machine learning was the way we referenced the field of AI broadly. I think a few things have changed. First of all, models have become really good. I mean, it’s obvious to everyone. I hope everyone here has used an AI model by now. I’m assuming that has happened. Seven years ago, no one had. I think consistency, quality, and overall output of models across the board have gotten really good, and that has just changed people’s experiences with AI.

I think the second thing that is becoming more real is the value of these models and how useful they are. It’s becoming more evident to many people. A couple of years ago, it was more theoretical about how they could potentially be used. There are still many avenues where we don’t entirely know how AI will change things. We just know it well. In some others, it has really changed many things.

In learning and education, it’s pretty clear that pretty much every student out there, from now into the future, will start using AI models to learn. But I think that has happened. Then competition, of course. Now, everyone’s paying attention to this. When we started, there was really no one trying to build. If you had this same conversation eight years ago, and I told you we’re going to have AI models that can render video in hyperrealistic ways, people would think we were crazy. Now, it’s an obvious direction, and there are a lot of people also trying to solve the same problem.

Was your ability to actually do the work constrained by the amount of compute you had at the beginning? Is it just scaling laws that brought you to where you are today?

So, scale is one of the main things. I think we’ve realized, as an industry, that scale matters. I guess the lesson that we’ve seen over time is that if you just scale computing, then models work really well. I think at the beginning, it wasn’t that obvious. It became more obvious over the last couple of years. And then more compute definitely helps, but more compute and more data, and also better algorithms. So it’s not just one single ingredient. It’s not just that if you get more compute, suddenly, things get better. I think it’s a combination of different things.

Just put this into practice for me. When you guys first started, how long would it take to render a frame of video versus how long now?

When we started, you couldn’t. That’s the thing. The first thing we ever did was a text-to-image model that produced 256-pixel-wide images. If you’ve ever seen a Mark Rothko painting, it was very abstract. That’s the closest it could get. So if you wanted to render a face, a house, or whatever, the result was in the range of colors, but it was very off. We went from that pixelated, very low-res image to 4K content that’s 20 seconds long with very sophisticated movement and actions. I think it’s the realization that at that time, video was not even in the scope of what we thought was possible.

Then, over time, it became really feasible. Now I think we joke that we’re consistently moving the goalpost, where the feedback we get from Runway is like, “Great, Cris. You can generate that bouncing ball on Mars, but in frame 27, the ball’s direction is slightly off.” I’m like, “Great, that’s a great piece of feedback,” because we will solve it. But also, you don’t realize that a year ago, you just didn’t think this was possible.

One of the reasons that I see the big platform companies are so invested in video generation, in particular, is that they’re pointed at the advertising industry. You mentioned you have advertising clients. Mark Zuckerberg is not even subtle anymore. He’s like, “I’m going to kill the advertising industry.” He just says it out loud.

I think he also said something similar at Stripe Sessions a couple of weeks ago. His pitch was something like, “You don’t even have to do anything. Just come to us and tell us how many customers you want, and maybe some ideas about what your product is. I’ll generate video advertising, and I’ll stick it in the feeds, and you just watch the money roll in.” This is a very Mark Zuckerberg way of thinking, but that is the first big market where you see we’re going to bring the cost of making the ads down, and that will result in some return. Is that where the demand is coming in for you as well?

I think that’s a very appealing concept and world for many people who have never had the chance of making ads in the first place. There are many businesses out there that just can’t afford to work with an agency to get a production team to shoot a AAA film or ad. I think part of it is like, “Well, if you can actually help others do that, I think that’s great.” It definitely increases or raises the bar for many because now anyone can do it. I think it’s less about killing the ad agencies; I think that’s an overall simplification. I think it’s more about reducing the time it takes to make something.

The cost of making any piece of content will, hopefully, go down to the cost of inference. So if you’re good at making things and conceptualizing ideas, you’re going to have systems that can aid you in generating whatever you need, but you still need to have a good idea. So you will still have agencies, you’ll still have talent and creatives, but perhaps the time it takes to make things is just going to be dramatically reduced. Hopefully, that opens the door for many other folks to do this work.

Yeah, I mean, I think Mark wants to kill the ad industry.

[Laughs] Yeah, we should ask him, I don’t know.

He’s a very aggressive human being. But the reason I ask that question is because I see so many of these products and so many of these capabilities, and they haven’t yet connected to business results. There was a study from IBM last month stating that 25% of the AI investments they had seen in companies had returned on that investment. It’s a low number. Everyone’s trying stuff and figuring it out. I get it in advertising. I understand that’s just the cost of acquiring customers. Have you seen places in film studios and other places where just bringing the cost down is worth the investment?

Yeah, absolutely. I was just on a call with a studio right before this, and we were going through a script that they wanted to test with Runway. I don’t know if you guys have ever worked in film, but you develop the script, and the common thing to do next is a storyboard. So, you basically take the storyboard and someone spends a week or two weeks just drawing. This is for a scene or a couple of scenes, not for an entire film. It’s really long, really expensive, and time-consuming. So, when they were reading me through the part of the script where they needed our help with Runway, I was generating the storyboards on the fly.

By the time they finished, the storyboard was done. So, I think the first thing was that they couldn’t realize or fully understand what was going on because they had never worked at that velocity, that speed. For them, speed is also cost. If you have to compound the time it takes to make all of those storyboards by hand and they have the screenwriters doing it in real time, then it shrinks the time and the whole project gets developed and worked on. So, you have all these moments and gaps where AI can really just help you accelerate your own work, specifically in creative industries where things are still very manually done.

I actually want to ask you about that because I know you think a lot about the creative industries and the act of creativity. The counterargument to that is the gap between the screenwriter and the storyboard artist, and the time it takes to communicate and translate is where the magic happens. Having the AI collapse that into a mechanical process, as opposed to a creative process, actually reduces the quality of the creative. How do you feel about that?

Yeah, I don’t think I fully agree with that. I think part of it is, I think, that we sometimes obsess about the process of how we make things. The goal of the screenwriter is to get the ideas that he wants in his mind or his world out there. The most obvious ways you work with the set of technologies and tools around you, if you’re able to do it faster, I think that’s great. You can iterate on concepts faster. You can understand your ideas faster. You can collaborate with more people, and you can make more. One of the bigger bottlenecks of media these days is that you have people working on one project for three or four years, then you might actually work on it, and the studio might actually try to kill it for many different reasons.

So, if you think about it, you spend four years of your life working on a thing that never saw the light of day because it happened to be killed for whatever reason. I think the idea will be that you don’t have to work on one project. You can work on many more. So, that’s also the quantity prospect of it that becomes a component we should consider. Because right now, we’re bound by the way we’re working. It’s very slow, and it’s very constrained by all these processes. If you can augment that, then people can start doing more and more and more. I think that’s great.

Is that the model for you? Is it that quantity will drive the business?

I think quantity leads to quality. As an artist, the more you make, the better things you’ll do. No artist has drawn once and thought, “Oh, suddenly, I’m a master.” Picasso painted hundreds of thousands of paintings, and many of you have never seen all of them. You just see the 1%. The same goes for musicians. People are there playing every single day until they hit something that actually works. I think tools should be like that. They should be able to augment how you work so you can do more, and then you’re the one choosing what you’re doing.

But look, I started the company because I always wanted to make films. I grew up in Chile, and I’ve never had the means of even buying a camera in the first place. I got my camera when I was 27 years old. It was pretty late, and part of it was very expensive. I couldn’t afford Adobe software because it was very expensive back then. I probably wouldn’t have become a greater filmmaker, but it would’ve been great if I had the chance to tell the stories that I had in my head. I think it was a technical barrier that prevented me from doing so. Now we have kids in every part of the world using Runway and making those ideas, which I find just fascinating. It’s great.

How does the pricing of Runway work? Where does your revenue come from? What’s the model?

It’s very simple. It’s a subscription. You just pay for the product, and you get access to different parts of it. We have a free tier, so you can also just use it for free. Then we work with schools. There’s a course at NYU, the NYU Film School, that teaches students how to use Runway. So, instead of going to film school and giving you a camera, they give you Runway. We’re doing that with a few other schools as well. For all of those, we just give access for free.

The studios you partner with, do they pay a lot of money, or are they subsidizing it for users?

No. For businesses, we charge. I mean, students can pay, but also, they pay because it’s useful. If it helps you do something, then sure, the value is worth it.

Are you profitable yet?

No, we’re growing, and I think a part of what we’re doing is just investing in research more than anything else.

What’s your runway?

[Laughs] We’ve been obsessively working on this. I would say over the last 12 to 18 months, the models got to a place where you can actually do very good things with Runway. I think there’s always an optimization function that companies have to run, which is, “Do you want to optimize for whatever is working now, or do you want to keep on growing?” I think for us, we really want to keep on growing. There’s a lot of research we can invest in and a lot of areas of growth that we can keep on going. So, I think the tension right now has always been like, “Do we want to optimize for this, or what’s next?” I think we want to lean into what’s next. I think there are a lot of things we haven’t actually fully discovered that we could do that we want to do.

One question I ask everybody on Decoder: How is Runway structured? How do you organize the company?

It’s very lean. Someone thought the other day that we were 1,000 people, and I thought that that was the best compliment that you could give me. We’re like 100 people or so. It’s very flat, and very focused on autonomy more than anything else. What we do is less of objectives and we actually don’t believe in objectives. We have a way of working where we just set boundaries and where we want people to do research or explore because a lot of what we do has never been done before. So, if I tell you how to get there, I’m probably wrong because we’ve never done it.

So, it’s research. You have to experiment and fail. What we do is we set their constraints and the boundaries on where we want you to experiment. The best outcomes of the research we’ve done have been about setting the right boundaries and then letting people go, letting people work on their own, and figuring out on their own how to do it.

So are you full holacracy, no org chart?

I mean, there’s some org chart in some way, but people collaborate. We have a studio, an internal studio with creatives, producers, and filmmakers working along with research. Those people are sitting at the same table, speaking the same language. They come from different backgrounds, but they managed to collaborate. So, yeah, that’s when you want to promote.

One of the reasons I’m interested in asking that question, particularly of AI companies of your size, is that there is a deep connection to the capabilities of the model, the research that’s being done, and the kinds of products you can build. I haven’t seen a lot of great, focused AI products. Runway actually might be one of them. But in the broad case, there’s ChatGPT, which is just an open-ended interface to a frontier model, and then we’re going to see what happens. Do you think that as you get bigger, the products will get more focused, or do you think you still need the connection between the team building the model and the product teams themselves?

I think the connection between product and model helps the product team better understand what’s coming. So, you need to understand that the way tech used to work was in much lower cycles of R&D. Now, research tends to move in very fast cycles. So, the issue with product, and I think product is one of the hardest things to do right now… You scope the area of product that we work on, design it, and start building it. By the time you build it, it’s obsolete. You’ve basically lost six months of work, or however long it takes you. So, product needs to behave like a research organization.

The way we tell our team is like, look, we have research scientists working on research, but everyone in the company is a scientist because everyone is running experiments. So, before you spend too much time doing something. Run an experiment, build a simple prototype, and understand if it’s worth it. Then, check with research to see if they think the thing you’re working with is going to become useful, or avoid getting submerged by the next generation of models. What happens a lot is that our customers are coming to us with specific questions like, “Hey, the model does this, but it doesn’t do this. Can you build a specific product for that?”

We could build a product just for that, or we could wait for the next generation of models that would just do all of that on the fly. So, that’s the tricky part because you’re always trying to play catch-up. I think companies that understand research are much better positioned than companies that are trying to catch up.

There’s a comparison I keep making here that you’re not going to like, but I’m going to make it anyway. I started covering tech a million years ago, now with gray hair and a beard. When Bluetooth came out, everybody knew what the product was going to be, right? Everybody saw the headsets. Every real estate agent in America had a giant Motorola headset, and it’s like, “Oh, you want AirPods? We want AirPods.” But the standard was just not ready for another decade, and then Apple had to actually build a proprietary layer on top of the standard to make AirPods.

That took a full decade. It was just not ready. There was a real dance there between, “What do we want to build? What’s the product? Can we build it, and does the technology support our goals?” You’re describing the same dynamic. The thing that gets me about what you’re describing is, well, the model’s just going to eat the product over and over and over again. How do you even know what products to build?

Yeah, it’s very hard.

Because everyone can see the AirPods, right? Everyone’s like, “The computer is going to talk to me, it’s going to be fine.”

Yeah, but I think that’s more than just “the computer will talk to me.” I think there are parts of how it will talk to you, and when it uses emotion. There’s a lot of product that goes back into research. I think no one really knows, to be honest, what the future product experience would look like because a lot of the interactions we’re having, we just never thought we could have. So, you’re only going to realize by having people use it. I think that happens a lot in research, where researchers spend so much time retaining and doing all the work, then you put it out, and in two minutes, someone figures out how to use it in a completely different way.

Actually, I think that’s great. It points to the fact that I think the previous generation of software was based on this idea of you choosing a vertical and just going there. I think the next generation of software is based on you choosing a principle of how you want to operate in the world, and you build models towards that. Our principle is that more of the pixels that you will watch will be generated or simulated. That’s the surface that we’re operating on. Therefore, you can go into many different products based on that idea. So, it’s the difference between choosing a vertical and choosing a principle in which you want to operate.

But right now, as you’re deciding what products to build, you’re getting market feedback from users. You have studios using the tool and agencies using the tool. You’ve got to make some decisions.

We do.

Where are we going to fill the gaps of the product, and where are we going to wait? How do you make those decisions?

We focus a lot on research and on understanding what’s coming and what’s worth building. I think there’s always a trade-off, specifically with startups, where if you spend too much time working on the wrong thing, it might actually kill you. I think we listen to users, but sometimes users don’t really know what they want. They know the problems really well, but they can’t articulate the exact solution for it. So, you don’t find yourself building exactly what they’re describing because they can’t describe the thing that they don’t know it’s coming.

So, I don’t know. I think it’s like art, I guess. You become just really good at intuition and being like, “Okay, that thing, even if it could be a great deal now, we’re not going to do it right now.” So I think companies overall build intuition, and that’s just experience of doing it enough times and then saying no. You have to say no a lot of times. Customers come with great ideas, but just say no. Not because you don’t think you can solve for them, but again, because it will trap you into the wrong thing for the wrong reason.

This is the other question I ask everybody broadly. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

How do I make decisions? What kind of decisions?

All of them.

I think there are different decisions. There are decisions that are much more long-term and irreversible, and decisions that are much more reversible. I think we’re very much of the idea that, again, run experiments and be willing to understand if you are wrong in your assumptions. If you need to make a decision, do it because you’re confident it will work.

If it doesn’t, you can change your mind. Sometimes, product decisions come from that taste component. I think overall taste has become a good way of directing the company, I would say, from how we operate in marketing and how we hire. I don’t think there’s one particular framework, but just the overall idea of taste and intuition has become clear in how we make decisions.

Do you think you’re going to have to change that as you hit the next set of scale? At 100 people, you can be like, “Just listen to me.” With 1,000 people, maybe not.

That’s the thing we keep referring to is the idea of a “company company.” We don’t want to be a “company company.” A “company company” is a company that behaves like a company because that’s the way companies behave. You’re like, “No, don’t do that. Be a company that’s focused on solving a problem, a research constraint, or a user need. Don’t focus on the things that are superficial that you’re supposed to be doing just because you’re a company.”

Because the moment you lose that, you’re dead. You’re going to stop innovating. You’re going to focus on the wrong things to optimize for. I think just culture, maybe, reinforces this to the team. I still interview everyone in the company. I’m still pretty much involved in how we make decisions on product. Organizations tend to seek slow velocity if they’re not constantly pushing all the time.

Do you think there’s going to come a point where the split between the capabilities of the underlying model slows down, and that you have to put more into product?

Maybe, but I don’t think we’re close to that. Even if we stop research now, like we decide collectively to stop research, I think there are 10 to 20 years of innovations that are just there, latent, waiting for someone to discover them. I don’t think we’re at that point yet where you can say, “Hey, this is enough,” because I think there’s just too much space to grow and have models to think. We just released a model two weeks ago, and I’m not kidding. Every day, I open our users on Twitter and Instagram, and there’s a new use case. Now, just before coming here, someone was using it for clothes.

So, you can try on anything. You basically go to any shop online, like an eCommerce site, upload a photo of yourself, and see yourself wearing that in a hyperrealistic manner. I just never thought you could use it for that, and you can. So, yeah.

I was talking to Kevin Scott, the CTO of Microsoft, and he made the same point in a slightly different way. He said there are more capabilities in the models we have today than anyone knows what to do with.

I agree.

To me, it’s like, “Well, then we should start building products that make sense.” But then the tension is whether the next-generation models are just going to eat my product. When does that get stable enough so anybody can make products that are good?

So here’s a great example. That’s a great distinction between verticals and principles. If you think about a vertical, then you’ll choose a solution and you’ll build towards that. If you think about a principle, you should assume that many of the things that we’re trying to build into the product will eventually become features of new models. Therefore, your product should be many layers ahead if you want to spend time on it. So, their principles should be, for example, image generation, zero-shot.

So, zero-shot learning (ZSL) means if you want to model to do something, you don’t have to train it. You need to just show it examples. You can widely expand the range of things models can do if you have the right examples. So, maybe a good idea is to find and collect examples of things you can teach models for, and then it changes the way you can approach product. I think that the distinction between principles and verticals is relevant for that.

One of the big trends in the industry is that the cost of every new model is getting exponentially higher. Sam Altman is touring the capitals of the world, being like, “Can I have $1 trillion?” Maybe he’ll get it. You never know. He might get it.

Yeah, maybe.

Are you on the same cost curve where every new model is that much more expensive?

Do you have $1 trillion?

Is the answer yes?

If you have one. So, I think AI tends to move in two ways. There’s an expansion wave and an optimization wave. Expansion is like, well, we’re discovering what we could do. If you think about the models from two or three years ago, yeah, they were expensive. Now, most of those models can be trained on your laptop because models have gone into a state where you can optimize them. One thing engineers love is optimizing things. So, if you tell them, here’s the thing that works, optimize it, people will go very hard on it. For some models that are two or three years old, now that’s the case.

They’re very cheap to train from scratch. I think there are new models that are still in the expansion phase. We haven’t figured out exactly how to optimize them, but we will. But the thing that happens is the same thing if you spend too much time optimizing them; the trade-off is going to stop working on the new expansion. I think most companies these days are betting on expanding. So, they’re betting on paying more for the sake of expanding that and not falling behind, rather than trying to optimize and reduce the cost of the thing that works.

Where are you?

I think we’re on the expansion side. Having the ability to expand that, having the ability to innovate on that, it’s way harder. And then having the ability to just catch up and play the optimization game is easier. I think our bet is like, well, this is the advantage point where you can keep on moving things and just pushing boundaries.

The big platform companies, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI — which has a deal with Microsoft — run their own hyperscalers. Is that a competitive threat to you? Is that an advantage to you?

Well, Google is an investor, so we work closely with them. Again, they’re different functions of businesses. If you’re a hyperscaler, you’re probably in the business of optimizing things. You need to make things cheap and scalable for everyone. It’s a different function from a research lab, which is building new things. So, again, it’s probably good to pair the two. Because if you have a good research lab without optimization, then there’s a transfer you can make technology-wise that will allow companies to just run on the things, sell them, and then get feedback. This is while the other part of the company is working on the next thing, which is where we are.

If Google’s an investor, you’re running on [Google Cloud Platform]?.

That’s correct.

So do you just let them buy the Nvidia H100s? Do you worry about that at all?

Nvidia is also an investor.

The AI industry is full of this, by the way. It’s very obvious.

Well, I think it’s people who have seen this, and I think you want to provoke this. Many of the things we’re discussing now weren’t that obvious eight years ago until many people started to make the right bets on it. I think again, depending on where you are, it might be a good function to partner with people who get it and who want to work with you long-term. I think the people we work with can help us get to that point. Yeah.

I think Nvidia as an investor is one of those things about the AI industry that is very funny, right? They’re investing in the applications that drive the usage of their chips and all these places. Maybe some of them will pay off, and maybe they won’t. That’s the nature of investing, but at some point, everything has to add up to actually deliver a return for Nvidia. Do you feel that pressure that Runway has to be a big enough business to justify all of the infrastructure expenses?

I think that justification comes from the value you see with customers and the adoption that you see. I think that’s how you see AI in products go from zero to many millions of revenue in a couple of weeks or months, something that was unseen before. It’s because it is such a different experience, it’s such a different value that if you’re ambitious about it. I think yeah, it will definitely get there. We’re already seeing this. Still, video, for example, is very early. Gen-4, our latest model, is literally a month and a half old. So, most of the world hasn’t experienced it yet. It’s also a distribution problem. How do you get to everyone out there who can use it?

Are you at millions in revenue?

Yeah, more than that.

Do you have a path to billions in revenue?

We hope, yeah, over the next couple of years.

I’m asking because all these companies have to generate billions in revenue for all these investments.

I think they will. Many will. I mean, again, think about different first principles. If you’re in the business of ads or movie-making, you’re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make one movie. If I can take that process and help you do it for a couple of million, then all the delta, I can literally charge for whatever delta I’m helping you improve. Hopefully, I can charge you way less, so you can actually do more. If you expand that, then you’re also not helping them, but you’re expanding the window of who can do that thing in the first place.

Because if you think about professional filmmaking, it’s a very niche, small industry, mostly because it’s very expensive. Well, if I have something that makes it cheaper, then I can expand their definition of who can get into the industry in the first place. From a market perspective, that’s great because you’ve got many more people who can do something that they never thought they could.

The film industry is really interesting. It’s under a lot of pressure, so much pressure that HBO Max just keeps renaming itself every six months to get whatever attention it can. It’s great.

It works, I guess.

But fundamentally, they’re competing with TikTokers and YouTubers, right? Netflix knows this. Netflix knows that YouTube is its biggest competition. The cost to make a YouTube video is already only a fraction of the cost to make a Marvel movie, and that has basically put the movie industry under a ton of pressure. Do you think AI can actually shrink that gap and keep the quality high?

Yeah, so I think that’s the point. I think the last frontier was low-quality content that anyone could make. I think that’s TikTok and YouTube. There are billions of people out there making everything. The difference between that and a high-production studio is the quality of the content, the output, and how good the output of the pixels and the videos is. That, for me, is mostly a technical barrier. It’s not a storytelling one. It’s not an idea one. Making a high-end science fiction movie is really expensive because you have to hire so many people and work with software that is very expensive. So the last frontier I would say for us, and I think many media companies, is billions of people making high-end content.

That is the one idea that I think if you’re in the traditional business of media and you haven’t realized that yet, you’re probably very scared because then you’ll compete with anyone in any part of the world who has a small budget, very good ideas, and can make amazing things. We’re already seeing this. The Academy Award for animation this year, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, went to a a movie called Flow. Very small budget, I think less than $10 million. It was just a very good group of people working with great software, and they won the Academy Award against $100 or $200 million productions. It’s just because you have very smart, talented people working with the right software tools.

So the flip side of this is those studios are also jealously protective of their IP. That’s the thing that they monetize. They window it into different distribution channels and into different regions. They sue pirates who steal it on BitTorrent. You trained on a lot of this content. There’s reporting that Runway trained on a bunch of YouTube channels, including The Verge’s, by the way. There’s your $1 trillion.

This is, in my mind, the single greatest threat to the already exorbitant cost structure of the AI industry. There are lawsuits everywhere that might say you have to pay all of those creators for their work. Have you thought about that risk?

I think it’s part of how we analyze and how we work. We’ve worked with different studios and companies to understand how to train the models for the needs that they have and what they want to do. Still, it’s crucial for me to help everyone understand what these models are actually doing. A lot of the assumptions that we get around AI video are that you type in a prompt and you get a movie. Now it happens less often, but I used to get a lot of scripts in my inbox where people would say, “Hey, I’m a producer or a writer. I’ve been working on this show. I have the whole script done. It’s great. I heard you do AI videos. So here’s the script, make my movie.”

I’ve realized a lot of people thought that what AI video, AI pixel generation, or making videos with AI meant was that you type in a prompt and you get the entire movie that you thought you were going to get. No, it doesn’t work like that. It will probably never work like that. You’re still pretty much involved. You need to tell the model how to use it. You need to tell the model the directions and the inputs you want to use. I think part of it is that perhaps most people’s experiences with AI over the last 12 months have been through chatbots. So the idea of AI has been condensed to this idea of chatbots.

If you have a chatbot, you have AI, and those things are summarizing a huge field into a very oversimplified concept. So when you think about copyright and you think about creating things, I think all the weight is still in what you are making. You’re still in control, and these are not tools that will make things on their own. You are the one deciding how to make them in a way. So you have to be responsible in how you use them. That’s basically the point.

But to train the model, you need to ingest a huge amount of data. The two things that make the models more effective in an expansion mode are more compute and more data. Have you thought about whether you’re going to have to pay for the data you ingested into the model?

So we’ve done partnerships to get data that we need in particular ways, but again, it’s really important to understand that these models are not trying to replicate the data. I think the common misconception is that people make is that you can type in a scene of a movie and you get the scene of that movie in Runway. These are not databases. They’re not storing the data. They’re learning. They’re students learning about data, getting patterns within that data, and they use that to create something net new. So the argument that I think is really important to consider is that these systems are creating net-new things, specifically for videos. They’re creating net-new everything pixels.

The way you use them should be in a responsible way, of course. The models are not trying to store anything. So that for me is the distinction because it changes the argument of how you think about training models in the first place. If you think about them as databases, you’re going to have a set of different assumptions, use cases, and concerns than if you think about them as general-purpose tools like a camera. I always think of Runway as a camera. A camera allows you to do anything you want. It’s up to you how you want to use it. You can get in trouble for using a camera, or you can make a great film by using a camera. So, you choose.

It’s shockingly easy to get in trouble for using a camera.

[Laughs] Yeah, I know. I grew up in Chile. There are a lot of films I didn’t manage to see [in theaters], and the way I saw them was that I bought them as bootlegs on street corners. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of those where people stand in the theater and just record the thing. I mean that was a bad use of cameras, but I think the overall assumption as a society was like, “Let’s not ban cameras. Let’s actually have a norm in theaters where you can’t do that. If you do, you’re going to get in trouble.” I think we all agree that that’s a good thing to do.

That argument is weaving its way through the legal system right now. There are lots and lots of court cases. The last time we went through this, it was basically Google that won a bunch of court cases about building databases. But Google was a friendly young company that had slides in the office; people wore beanies when they went to work.

The inherent utility of Google’s structure was very obvious to every judge. The inherent utility of YouTube, which got in a lot of trouble, was very obvious to every judge. They horsepower their way through it. They had to pay some money to some people, and they had to win some cases. They had to invest a lot into litigation, and they won because they were cute and they were Google. It was a very different time.Tech companies are not broadly thought of as young and cute anymore. No one thinks of Meta, Amazon, and Google as adorable companies that should build the future the way that they were at the time.

Have you thought about the risk that they might lose these cases and what that would do to your business? Because this dynamic you’re talking about — whether this is a non-infringing use, whether there’s broad utility here — this argument goes back to the Betamax case in the ‘80s. It’s all there, but it doesn’t have to go the way that it always did, right? Judges are just a bunch of people, as we’ve discovered here in America. They just make decisions. What if it doesn’t go your way?

Yeah, again, it’s hard for me to have an opinion on every single case out there. I think it’s more complex than that. I think Google has had a great impact on the world at large. I think it’s hard to disagree on that. I think the world has gotten way more expansive. Information has become more accessible to many. I think that’s hard to disagree with, right? I think there are definitely new challenges with every new technology. I don’t disagree with that. I mean, you are putting really powerful technology in the hands of everyone, which means everyone, right? So there are use cases around AI that you should be preventing, and you should try to make sure you have systems of regulation and safety on top. I think every company is different.

One thing I’ve really learned about tech, and I mentioned this as an artist… I went to art school, and I started working on tech mostly as a way to develop my vision of how art should work with tech. That was my idea. So I still consider myself an outsider to tech, and I think one thing I would consider is that not everyone operates in the same way. I think not all companies are the same. Companies tend to be different in how they operate, and I think there are different ways of managing through this change. It’s hard for me to group everyone in the same group and say, “Yeah, all tech companies are basically doing the same thing.”

Let me try this a different way. You trained on YouTube channels, right?

We train on a variety of different data sets, and so we have teams working on image, video, text, and audio. We don’t disclose how we train our models because that’s unique to, I guess, our research.

Did you train on YouTube?

Again, we have a variety of different data sets that we use to train our models, depending on the task. It’s not about, “Do we train on this, on that?” We have agreements with different companies. We have partnerships with others. The way we train is very unique to us. It’s very competitive over there, so we’re probably never going to tell how we do it because it’s very unique to how we train our models.

YouTubers own the copyrights to their videos. If it comes out that you trained on YouTube and hundreds of YouTubers come asking you for money at whatever rates, is the financial model of Runway still tenable?

I guess it goes back to what these models are doing, right?

Well, I’m saying that if OpenAI loses its case against the New York Times and training on the Times’ content is found to be infringing, the floodgates will open. It is not clear if OpenAI will win or lose. If Meta loses its cases against the book publishers — and it’s not doing great in the past couple of weeks — the floodgates are open. If those floodgates open, is your business tenable?

I think again, summarizing the entire AI industry as chatbots and what one company is doing, I think, is a mistake. I think, again, video and media work very differently, and there are a lot of other considerations. A lot of the assumptions around how AI works that I’ve seen about video are based on opinions about cell phones in 1992. You’re just probably very early on seeing the impact of how that technology will change the industry, and probably you’ve never experienced it before. So, I think part of what is going to happen over time is that a lot of these ideas around concern for copyright and other considerations will start to change as people understand how this actually works. I’ll give you an example.

I was at a dinner with a producer of a major show, one you’ve all probably seen. He was like, “I’m very anti-AI.” I said, “Okay, why are you anti-AI?” He’s like, “Well, because it works like this and it does this.” I was like, “No, it doesn’t. Let me show you how it works.” Then we showed him how it works, and he was like, “Yeah, now I’m on board.” It took me like 25 minutes. I think he was very adamant about his position of being very against AI because I realized he just had the wrong expectations about what it did. I think it was a minute of like, okay, let me show you what it does. It’s like you’ve never experienced this before.

We forgot this, but we all had to go through training to send our first email. People were just telling you how to send an email, and you have to go through it. You don’t just understand it, and so you start using it. You understand the limitations of it and the constraints of it, and then you start using it. I think a lot of the hard takes on AI these days are based on just the right expectations and the wrong assumptions of what it actually does.

That gap between how artists feel about AI and how much they actually use it seems like it’s getting bigger every day. It shows up on our site at The Verge. By the way, The Verge is built on the very foundation that I was right about my opinions about cell phones in 1992.

[Laughs] One of few.

But we see it, right? The people read the articles. I talk to product people at other companies. With Adobe, for example, the usage rate of generative AI in Adobe products is basically 100%. Generative fill is used as often as layers, which means everyone uses it every day, and then the audience is like, “I hate this. Make it go away.” There’s just this gap. It’s a moral gap. It’s a psychological gap, whatever it is. There’s a gap between how people are using it, how they talk about it, and how they feel about it, particularly with creatives and artists. I know you spend a lot of time with creatives. How are you closing that gap? Is it possible to close that gap?

I don’t see that gap that often. I think in film, there’s the idea of below the line and above the line. If you speak with a VFX artist, someone who’s actually moving the pixels on a screen, they don’t have weekends. They’ve never had a weekend off because when you’re on a project, it’s a very tough timeline with very small budgets. The director comes with notes, and you have to take the notes. It’s a Friday, and there goes your weekend. You’re going to be working on pushing those edits every day, and you’re doing it by hand. So, if you have a tool that allows you to do it faster, of course, you will use it. It’s great.

It will get you where you need to go faster. I think the gap there is not as big as some people might think because the actual creative minds, the producers, the editors, and the VFX artists, are already embracing this. It is very valuable, and I guess I’m not surprised about your stats and numbers. I think still… Above the line, the people who think about creatives as, “Oh, I have never had the experience actually working and seeing it,” might have a different assumption of how it works. Again, I think part of it is just that we need to show you how it actually works. Something we do is… We have a film festival here in New York, by the way, if anyone here wants to go. We’ve done it for three years now. It’s in the Lincoln Center. It’s a major event. It gathers filmmakers from all over the world.

We started the festival with 300 submissions. This year, we got 6,000 submissions. We work with the American Cinema Editors, which is one of the guilds of the editors, and we work with the Tribeca Film Festival, so the industry partners. It’s a great way of understanding how it’s actually being used in real production use cases and how valuable it is for not only the insiders but also the new voices. I think part of the gap is that you need to go to a film festival to experience it, and you’ll probably get a sense of how useful it is.

The concern from that class of people that we hear all the time is, “This is great. It made everyone’s life a little bit easier. It also puts half of us out of work.” Do you see that as a real threat or as a real outcome?

I understand the concern, but I think the obsession should be on people more than jobs. We used to have people who pressed buttons in elevators. That was a job. I don’t know if you guys remember this. That was a job. There was a job of people throwing stones to wake you up before alarm clocks were invented. I think no one is saying we should protect people who throw rocks because of their job. We should have alarm clocks, and the person who’s throwing rocks to wake you up should be taught how to do something else. So, you focus on the people and how you upskill, upgrade, learn, and teach people to do new things rather than like, “Hey, let’s keep this thing because we need people pressing buttons in elevators, and that’s a job.”

I think that has happened in Hollywood many times. In the beginning, Hollywood was silent. There were silent movies. Talkies came around. It was a major breakthrough where you could actually have sound in movies. The industry revolted. Charles Chaplin was one of the biggest advocates against films with sound because he said that sound would just kill the essence of filmmaking. An argument that they had was like, “Who’s going to pay the orchestras that are playing in the theaters?”

Well, it’s true. Yeah, we don’t need orchestras in theaters anymore. But also, the technology gave birth to an entirely new industry of artists. Hans Zimmer, that was the beginning of an entirely new industry given by technology. I think this is, for me, very similar, where yes, we’re going to lose some jobs. Our job should be to train those people to do new things with technology.

Last question. If you had to spin that all the way out, you’re successful; the AI industry can pull this off. The models get the capabilities you want them to have. What does the film industry look like 10 years from now?

I think it looks very much like…

It’s not just TikTok? Are we just going to do Quibi?

[Laughs] No, I mean, if someone likes making that, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. I think there are many independent voices out there who have never had the chance to tell their stories because they don’t have the means to tell them. Our vision of Runway is that the best stories have yet to be told. We haven’t heard from the greatest storyteller in the world because maybe they just weren’t born in LA.

That probably is the case, and so I think we’re going to see a much more democratized version of film. We’re going to have a version of storytelling that’s for everyone, and the bar for it will be the ideas. It won’t be who you know in the industry or how much money you have. It’ll be how good the thing you want to say is and how good you are at saying it.

Well, Cris, this has been amazing. You’re going to have to come back on Decoder soon.

Of course. Thank you for having me.

Decoder with Nilay Patel A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems. SUBSCRIBE NOW!",Technology
https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube#comments,"Today, I’m talking with Runway CEO and cofounder Cris Valenzuela. This one’s special: Cris and I were live at an event in New York City last month hosted by Alix Partners, so you’ll hear the audience in the background from time to time.

Runway is one of the leading AI video generation platforms. The basic concept is familiar by now: you start with a reference image — either something you’ve created using Runway’s own model or something you upload — you type in a prompt, and Runway spits out a fully formed video sequence.

But what’s most interesting to me about Runway is that while the AI hype is at a fever pitch right now, there’s a little more depth to the company. Cris founded the company back in 2018, so he’s been through some boom-and-bust periods in AI, and you’ll hear that experience come through as we talk about the technology and what it can and can’t do. When Cris began to more seriously explore AI video generation, as a researcher at New York University, we still mostly referred to AI as “machine learning,” and you’ll hear him recount how primitive the technology was back then compared to now.

That said, the AI hype really is out of control, and Runway is on the same collision course with creators, artists, and copyright law as every other part of the AI industry — and you’ll hear Cris and I really get into all that here.

One theme you’ll hear Cris come back to again and again in this conversation is that he does not see Runway as a disruptive outsider to filmmaking, but rather as an active participant in the art. He sees Runway as a tool that will bring filmmaking and other forms of artistic expression to many more people, and not as an apocalyptic force that’s going to hit Hollywood like a wrecking ball.

You’ll hear him say Runway is working with many of the biggest movie studios — publicly, it has already struck a deal with Lionsgate and AMC Networks. In the AMC announcement, Cris said embracing AI video generation was a “make-or-break moment” for every entertainment company.

But cozying up to Hollywood doesn’t mean Runway is off the hook in the AI vs. art debate. In fact, Runway itself is part of an ongoing class-action lawsuit over the use of artistic works in AI training data. Last year, it was revealed Runway had trained on huge swaths of copyrighted YouTube material, including The Verge’s own YouTube channel.

So I asked Cris as plainly as I could whether Runway had in fact trained on YouTube and how the industry might survive a world where all these companies are made to pay substantial amounts of money to creators if even one of these big AI copyright lawsuits doesn’t break their way. I think you’ll find our discussion on this to be pretty candid, and Cris articulated some of his own defenses for how the AI industry has approached this topic and what might happen next.

It’s Decoder, so of course we also talked about Runway’s structure. Cris has a lot to say about Runway functioning as a research lab, and the tension that exists between releasing and refining real products and then putting them into the hands of professionals, all while working on new models and tools that might make the current tech obsolete.

Okay: Runway CEO Cris Valenzuela. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

You started Runway before the big AI boom. We were joking earlier that the URL is Runway.ml because people were calling it machine learning before. What’s changed since the boom in that approach? Have you had to rethink, “Okay, everyone understands what training a model is now, and the market for GPUs is more expensive.” What are the changes?

A lot has changed. I think we started the company in 2018. Machine learning was the way we referenced the field of AI broadly. I think a few things have changed. First of all, models have become really good. I mean, it’s obvious to everyone. I hope everyone here has used an AI model by now. I’m assuming that has happened. Seven years ago, no one had. I think consistency, quality, and overall output of models across the board have gotten really good, and that has just changed people’s experiences with AI.

I think the second thing that is becoming more real is the value of these models and how useful they are. It’s becoming more evident to many people. A couple of years ago, it was more theoretical about how they could potentially be used. There are still many avenues where we don’t entirely know how AI will change things. We just know it well. In some others, it has really changed many things.

In learning and education, it’s pretty clear that pretty much every student out there, from now into the future, will start using AI models to learn. But I think that has happened. Then competition, of course. Now, everyone’s paying attention to this. When we started, there was really no one trying to build. If you had this same conversation eight years ago, and I told you we’re going to have AI models that can render video in hyperrealistic ways, people would think we were crazy. Now, it’s an obvious direction, and there are a lot of people also trying to solve the same problem.

Was your ability to actually do the work constrained by the amount of compute you had at the beginning? Is it just scaling laws that brought you to where you are today?

So, scale is one of the main things. I think we’ve realized, as an industry, that scale matters. I guess the lesson that we’ve seen over time is that if you just scale computing, then models work really well. I think at the beginning, it wasn’t that obvious. It became more obvious over the last couple of years. And then more compute definitely helps, but more compute and more data, and also better algorithms. So it’s not just one single ingredient. It’s not just that if you get more compute, suddenly, things get better. I think it’s a combination of different things.

Just put this into practice for me. When you guys first started, how long would it take to render a frame of video versus how long now?

When we started, you couldn’t. That’s the thing. The first thing we ever did was a text-to-image model that produced 256-pixel-wide images. If you’ve ever seen a Mark Rothko painting, it was very abstract. That’s the closest it could get. So if you wanted to render a face, a house, or whatever, the result was in the range of colors, but it was very off. We went from that pixelated, very low-res image to 4K content that’s 20 seconds long with very sophisticated movement and actions. I think it’s the realization that at that time, video was not even in the scope of what we thought was possible.

Then, over time, it became really feasible. Now I think we joke that we’re consistently moving the goalpost, where the feedback we get from Runway is like, “Great, Cris. You can generate that bouncing ball on Mars, but in frame 27, the ball’s direction is slightly off.” I’m like, “Great, that’s a great piece of feedback,” because we will solve it. But also, you don’t realize that a year ago, you just didn’t think this was possible.

One of the reasons that I see the big platform companies are so invested in video generation, in particular, is that they’re pointed at the advertising industry. You mentioned you have advertising clients. Mark Zuckerberg is not even subtle anymore. He’s like, “I’m going to kill the advertising industry.” He just says it out loud.

I think he also said something similar at Stripe Sessions a couple of weeks ago. His pitch was something like, “You don’t even have to do anything. Just come to us and tell us how many customers you want, and maybe some ideas about what your product is. I’ll generate video advertising, and I’ll stick it in the feeds, and you just watch the money roll in.” This is a very Mark Zuckerberg way of thinking, but that is the first big market where you see we’re going to bring the cost of making the ads down, and that will result in some return. Is that where the demand is coming in for you as well?

I think that’s a very appealing concept and world for many people who have never had the chance of making ads in the first place. There are many businesses out there that just can’t afford to work with an agency to get a production team to shoot a AAA film or ad. I think part of it is like, “Well, if you can actually help others do that, I think that’s great.” It definitely increases or raises the bar for many because now anyone can do it. I think it’s less about killing the ad agencies; I think that’s an overall simplification. I think it’s more about reducing the time it takes to make something.

The cost of making any piece of content will, hopefully, go down to the cost of inference. So if you’re good at making things and conceptualizing ideas, you’re going to have systems that can aid you in generating whatever you need, but you still need to have a good idea. So you will still have agencies, you’ll still have talent and creatives, but perhaps the time it takes to make things is just going to be dramatically reduced. Hopefully, that opens the door for many other folks to do this work.

Yeah, I mean, I think Mark wants to kill the ad industry.

[Laughs] Yeah, we should ask him, I don’t know.

He’s a very aggressive human being. But the reason I ask that question is because I see so many of these products and so many of these capabilities, and they haven’t yet connected to business results. There was a study from IBM last month stating that 25% of the AI investments they had seen in companies had returned on that investment. It’s a low number. Everyone’s trying stuff and figuring it out. I get it in advertising. I understand that’s just the cost of acquiring customers. Have you seen places in film studios and other places where just bringing the cost down is worth the investment?

Yeah, absolutely. I was just on a call with a studio right before this, and we were going through a script that they wanted to test with Runway. I don’t know if you guys have ever worked in film, but you develop the script, and the common thing to do next is a storyboard. So, you basically take the storyboard and someone spends a week or two weeks just drawing. This is for a scene or a couple of scenes, not for an entire film. It’s really long, really expensive, and time-consuming. So, when they were reading me through the part of the script where they needed our help with Runway, I was generating the storyboards on the fly.

By the time they finished, the storyboard was done. So, I think the first thing was that they couldn’t realize or fully understand what was going on because they had never worked at that velocity, that speed. For them, speed is also cost. If you have to compound the time it takes to make all of those storyboards by hand and they have the screenwriters doing it in real time, then it shrinks the time and the whole project gets developed and worked on. So, you have all these moments and gaps where AI can really just help you accelerate your own work, specifically in creative industries where things are still very manually done.

I actually want to ask you about that because I know you think a lot about the creative industries and the act of creativity. The counterargument to that is the gap between the screenwriter and the storyboard artist, and the time it takes to communicate and translate is where the magic happens. Having the AI collapse that into a mechanical process, as opposed to a creative process, actually reduces the quality of the creative. How do you feel about that?

Yeah, I don’t think I fully agree with that. I think part of it is, I think, that we sometimes obsess about the process of how we make things. The goal of the screenwriter is to get the ideas that he wants in his mind or his world out there. The most obvious ways you work with the set of technologies and tools around you, if you’re able to do it faster, I think that’s great. You can iterate on concepts faster. You can understand your ideas faster. You can collaborate with more people, and you can make more. One of the bigger bottlenecks of media these days is that you have people working on one project for three or four years, then you might actually work on it, and the studio might actually try to kill it for many different reasons.

So, if you think about it, you spend four years of your life working on a thing that never saw the light of day because it happened to be killed for whatever reason. I think the idea will be that you don’t have to work on one project. You can work on many more. So, that’s also the quantity prospect of it that becomes a component we should consider. Because right now, we’re bound by the way we’re working. It’s very slow, and it’s very constrained by all these processes. If you can augment that, then people can start doing more and more and more. I think that’s great.

Is that the model for you? Is it that quantity will drive the business?

I think quantity leads to quality. As an artist, the more you make, the better things you’ll do. No artist has drawn once and thought, “Oh, suddenly, I’m a master.” Picasso painted hundreds of thousands of paintings, and many of you have never seen all of them. You just see the 1%. The same goes for musicians. People are there playing every single day until they hit something that actually works. I think tools should be like that. They should be able to augment how you work so you can do more, and then you’re the one choosing what you’re doing.

But look, I started the company because I always wanted to make films. I grew up in Chile, and I’ve never had the means of even buying a camera in the first place. I got my camera when I was 27 years old. It was pretty late, and part of it was very expensive. I couldn’t afford Adobe software because it was very expensive back then. I probably wouldn’t have become a greater filmmaker, but it would’ve been great if I had the chance to tell the stories that I had in my head. I think it was a technical barrier that prevented me from doing so. Now we have kids in every part of the world using Runway and making those ideas, which I find just fascinating. It’s great.

How does the pricing of Runway work? Where does your revenue come from? What’s the model?

It’s very simple. It’s a subscription. You just pay for the product, and you get access to different parts of it. We have a free tier, so you can also just use it for free. Then we work with schools. There’s a course at NYU, the NYU Film School, that teaches students how to use Runway. So, instead of going to film school and giving you a camera, they give you Runway. We’re doing that with a few other schools as well. For all of those, we just give access for free.

The studios you partner with, do they pay a lot of money, or are they subsidizing it for users?

No. For businesses, we charge. I mean, students can pay, but also, they pay because it’s useful. If it helps you do something, then sure, the value is worth it.

Are you profitable yet?

No, we’re growing, and I think a part of what we’re doing is just investing in research more than anything else.

What’s your runway?

[Laughs] We’ve been obsessively working on this. I would say over the last 12 to 18 months, the models got to a place where you can actually do very good things with Runway. I think there’s always an optimization function that companies have to run, which is, “Do you want to optimize for whatever is working now, or do you want to keep on growing?” I think for us, we really want to keep on growing. There’s a lot of research we can invest in and a lot of areas of growth that we can keep on going. So, I think the tension right now has always been like, “Do we want to optimize for this, or what’s next?” I think we want to lean into what’s next. I think there are a lot of things we haven’t actually fully discovered that we could do that we want to do.

One question I ask everybody on Decoder: How is Runway structured? How do you organize the company?

It’s very lean. Someone thought the other day that we were 1,000 people, and I thought that that was the best compliment that you could give me. We’re like 100 people or so. It’s very flat, and very focused on autonomy more than anything else. What we do is less of objectives and we actually don’t believe in objectives. We have a way of working where we just set boundaries and where we want people to do research or explore because a lot of what we do has never been done before. So, if I tell you how to get there, I’m probably wrong because we’ve never done it.

So, it’s research. You have to experiment and fail. What we do is we set their constraints and the boundaries on where we want you to experiment. The best outcomes of the research we’ve done have been about setting the right boundaries and then letting people go, letting people work on their own, and figuring out on their own how to do it.

So are you full holacracy, no org chart?

I mean, there’s some org chart in some way, but people collaborate. We have a studio, an internal studio with creatives, producers, and filmmakers working along with research. Those people are sitting at the same table, speaking the same language. They come from different backgrounds, but they managed to collaborate. So, yeah, that’s when you want to promote.

One of the reasons I’m interested in asking that question, particularly of AI companies of your size, is that there is a deep connection to the capabilities of the model, the research that’s being done, and the kinds of products you can build. I haven’t seen a lot of great, focused AI products. Runway actually might be one of them. But in the broad case, there’s ChatGPT, which is just an open-ended interface to a frontier model, and then we’re going to see what happens. Do you think that as you get bigger, the products will get more focused, or do you think you still need the connection between the team building the model and the product teams themselves?

I think the connection between product and model helps the product team better understand what’s coming. So, you need to understand that the way tech used to work was in much lower cycles of R&D. Now, research tends to move in very fast cycles. So, the issue with product, and I think product is one of the hardest things to do right now… You scope the area of product that we work on, design it, and start building it. By the time you build it, it’s obsolete. You’ve basically lost six months of work, or however long it takes you. So, product needs to behave like a research organization.

The way we tell our team is like, look, we have research scientists working on research, but everyone in the company is a scientist because everyone is running experiments. So, before you spend too much time doing something. Run an experiment, build a simple prototype, and understand if it’s worth it. Then, check with research to see if they think the thing you’re working with is going to become useful, or avoid getting submerged by the next generation of models. What happens a lot is that our customers are coming to us with specific questions like, “Hey, the model does this, but it doesn’t do this. Can you build a specific product for that?”

We could build a product just for that, or we could wait for the next generation of models that would just do all of that on the fly. So, that’s the tricky part because you’re always trying to play catch-up. I think companies that understand research are much better positioned than companies that are trying to catch up.

There’s a comparison I keep making here that you’re not going to like, but I’m going to make it anyway. I started covering tech a million years ago, now with gray hair and a beard. When Bluetooth came out, everybody knew what the product was going to be, right? Everybody saw the headsets. Every real estate agent in America had a giant Motorola headset, and it’s like, “Oh, you want AirPods? We want AirPods.” But the standard was just not ready for another decade, and then Apple had to actually build a proprietary layer on top of the standard to make AirPods.

That took a full decade. It was just not ready. There was a real dance there between, “What do we want to build? What’s the product? Can we build it, and does the technology support our goals?” You’re describing the same dynamic. The thing that gets me about what you’re describing is, well, the model’s just going to eat the product over and over and over again. How do you even know what products to build?

Yeah, it’s very hard.

Because everyone can see the AirPods, right? Everyone’s like, “The computer is going to talk to me, it’s going to be fine.”

Yeah, but I think that’s more than just “the computer will talk to me.” I think there are parts of how it will talk to you, and when it uses emotion. There’s a lot of product that goes back into research. I think no one really knows, to be honest, what the future product experience would look like because a lot of the interactions we’re having, we just never thought we could have. So, you’re only going to realize by having people use it. I think that happens a lot in research, where researchers spend so much time retaining and doing all the work, then you put it out, and in two minutes, someone figures out how to use it in a completely different way.

Actually, I think that’s great. It points to the fact that I think the previous generation of software was based on this idea of you choosing a vertical and just going there. I think the next generation of software is based on you choosing a principle of how you want to operate in the world, and you build models towards that. Our principle is that more of the pixels that you will watch will be generated or simulated. That’s the surface that we’re operating on. Therefore, you can go into many different products based on that idea. So, it’s the difference between choosing a vertical and choosing a principle in which you want to operate.

But right now, as you’re deciding what products to build, you’re getting market feedback from users. You have studios using the tool and agencies using the tool. You’ve got to make some decisions.

We do.

Where are we going to fill the gaps of the product, and where are we going to wait? How do you make those decisions?

We focus a lot on research and on understanding what’s coming and what’s worth building. I think there’s always a trade-off, specifically with startups, where if you spend too much time working on the wrong thing, it might actually kill you. I think we listen to users, but sometimes users don’t really know what they want. They know the problems really well, but they can’t articulate the exact solution for it. So, you don’t find yourself building exactly what they’re describing because they can’t describe the thing that they don’t know it’s coming.

So, I don’t know. I think it’s like art, I guess. You become just really good at intuition and being like, “Okay, that thing, even if it could be a great deal now, we’re not going to do it right now.” So I think companies overall build intuition, and that’s just experience of doing it enough times and then saying no. You have to say no a lot of times. Customers come with great ideas, but just say no. Not because you don’t think you can solve for them, but again, because it will trap you into the wrong thing for the wrong reason.

This is the other question I ask everybody broadly. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

How do I make decisions? What kind of decisions?

All of them.

I think there are different decisions. There are decisions that are much more long-term and irreversible, and decisions that are much more reversible. I think we’re very much of the idea that, again, run experiments and be willing to understand if you are wrong in your assumptions. If you need to make a decision, do it because you’re confident it will work.

If it doesn’t, you can change your mind. Sometimes, product decisions come from that taste component. I think overall taste has become a good way of directing the company, I would say, from how we operate in marketing and how we hire. I don’t think there’s one particular framework, but just the overall idea of taste and intuition has become clear in how we make decisions.

Do you think you’re going to have to change that as you hit the next set of scale? At 100 people, you can be like, “Just listen to me.” With 1,000 people, maybe not.

That’s the thing we keep referring to is the idea of a “company company.” We don’t want to be a “company company.” A “company company” is a company that behaves like a company because that’s the way companies behave. You’re like, “No, don’t do that. Be a company that’s focused on solving a problem, a research constraint, or a user need. Don’t focus on the things that are superficial that you’re supposed to be doing just because you’re a company.”

Because the moment you lose that, you’re dead. You’re going to stop innovating. You’re going to focus on the wrong things to optimize for. I think just culture, maybe, reinforces this to the team. I still interview everyone in the company. I’m still pretty much involved in how we make decisions on product. Organizations tend to seek slow velocity if they’re not constantly pushing all the time.

Do you think there’s going to come a point where the split between the capabilities of the underlying model slows down, and that you have to put more into product?

Maybe, but I don’t think we’re close to that. Even if we stop research now, like we decide collectively to stop research, I think there are 10 to 20 years of innovations that are just there, latent, waiting for someone to discover them. I don’t think we’re at that point yet where you can say, “Hey, this is enough,” because I think there’s just too much space to grow and have models to think. We just released a model two weeks ago, and I’m not kidding. Every day, I open our users on Twitter and Instagram, and there’s a new use case. Now, just before coming here, someone was using it for clothes.

So, you can try on anything. You basically go to any shop online, like an eCommerce site, upload a photo of yourself, and see yourself wearing that in a hyperrealistic manner. I just never thought you could use it for that, and you can. So, yeah.

I was talking to Kevin Scott, the CTO of Microsoft, and he made the same point in a slightly different way. He said there are more capabilities in the models we have today than anyone knows what to do with.

I agree.

To me, it’s like, “Well, then we should start building products that make sense.” But then the tension is whether the next-generation models are just going to eat my product. When does that get stable enough so anybody can make products that are good?

So here’s a great example. That’s a great distinction between verticals and principles. If you think about a vertical, then you’ll choose a solution and you’ll build towards that. If you think about a principle, you should assume that many of the things that we’re trying to build into the product will eventually become features of new models. Therefore, your product should be many layers ahead if you want to spend time on it. So, their principles should be, for example, image generation, zero-shot.

So, zero-shot learning (ZSL) means if you want to model to do something, you don’t have to train it. You need to just show it examples. You can widely expand the range of things models can do if you have the right examples. So, maybe a good idea is to find and collect examples of things you can teach models for, and then it changes the way you can approach product. I think that the distinction between principles and verticals is relevant for that.

One of the big trends in the industry is that the cost of every new model is getting exponentially higher. Sam Altman is touring the capitals of the world, being like, “Can I have $1 trillion?” Maybe he’ll get it. You never know. He might get it.

Yeah, maybe.

Are you on the same cost curve where every new model is that much more expensive?

Do you have $1 trillion?

Is the answer yes?

If you have one. So, I think AI tends to move in two ways. There’s an expansion wave and an optimization wave. Expansion is like, well, we’re discovering what we could do. If you think about the models from two or three years ago, yeah, they were expensive. Now, most of those models can be trained on your laptop because models have gone into a state where you can optimize them. One thing engineers love is optimizing things. So, if you tell them, here’s the thing that works, optimize it, people will go very hard on it. For some models that are two or three years old, now that’s the case.

They’re very cheap to train from scratch. I think there are new models that are still in the expansion phase. We haven’t figured out exactly how to optimize them, but we will. But the thing that happens is the same thing if you spend too much time optimizing them; the trade-off is going to stop working on the new expansion. I think most companies these days are betting on expanding. So, they’re betting on paying more for the sake of expanding that and not falling behind, rather than trying to optimize and reduce the cost of the thing that works.

Where are you?

I think we’re on the expansion side. Having the ability to expand that, having the ability to innovate on that, it’s way harder. And then having the ability to just catch up and play the optimization game is easier. I think our bet is like, well, this is the advantage point where you can keep on moving things and just pushing boundaries.

The big platform companies, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI — which has a deal with Microsoft — run their own hyperscalers. Is that a competitive threat to you? Is that an advantage to you?

Well, Google is an investor, so we work closely with them. Again, they’re different functions of businesses. If you’re a hyperscaler, you’re probably in the business of optimizing things. You need to make things cheap and scalable for everyone. It’s a different function from a research lab, which is building new things. So, again, it’s probably good to pair the two. Because if you have a good research lab without optimization, then there’s a transfer you can make technology-wise that will allow companies to just run on the things, sell them, and then get feedback. This is while the other part of the company is working on the next thing, which is where we are.

If Google’s an investor, you’re running on [Google Cloud Platform]?.

That’s correct.

So do you just let them buy the Nvidia H100s? Do you worry about that at all?

Nvidia is also an investor.

The AI industry is full of this, by the way. It’s very obvious.

Well, I think it’s people who have seen this, and I think you want to provoke this. Many of the things we’re discussing now weren’t that obvious eight years ago until many people started to make the right bets on it. I think again, depending on where you are, it might be a good function to partner with people who get it and who want to work with you long-term. I think the people we work with can help us get to that point. Yeah.

I think Nvidia as an investor is one of those things about the AI industry that is very funny, right? They’re investing in the applications that drive the usage of their chips and all these places. Maybe some of them will pay off, and maybe they won’t. That’s the nature of investing, but at some point, everything has to add up to actually deliver a return for Nvidia. Do you feel that pressure that Runway has to be a big enough business to justify all of the infrastructure expenses?

I think that justification comes from the value you see with customers and the adoption that you see. I think that’s how you see AI in products go from zero to many millions of revenue in a couple of weeks or months, something that was unseen before. It’s because it is such a different experience, it’s such a different value that if you’re ambitious about it. I think yeah, it will definitely get there. We’re already seeing this. Still, video, for example, is very early. Gen-4, our latest model, is literally a month and a half old. So, most of the world hasn’t experienced it yet. It’s also a distribution problem. How do you get to everyone out there who can use it?

Are you at millions in revenue?

Yeah, more than that.

Do you have a path to billions in revenue?

We hope, yeah, over the next couple of years.

I’m asking because all these companies have to generate billions in revenue for all these investments.

I think they will. Many will. I mean, again, think about different first principles. If you’re in the business of ads or movie-making, you’re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make one movie. If I can take that process and help you do it for a couple of million, then all the delta, I can literally charge for whatever delta I’m helping you improve. Hopefully, I can charge you way less, so you can actually do more. If you expand that, then you’re also not helping them, but you’re expanding the window of who can do that thing in the first place.

Because if you think about professional filmmaking, it’s a very niche, small industry, mostly because it’s very expensive. Well, if I have something that makes it cheaper, then I can expand their definition of who can get into the industry in the first place. From a market perspective, that’s great because you’ve got many more people who can do something that they never thought they could.

The film industry is really interesting. It’s under a lot of pressure, so much pressure that HBO Max just keeps renaming itself every six months to get whatever attention it can. It’s great.

It works, I guess.

But fundamentally, they’re competing with TikTokers and YouTubers, right? Netflix knows this. Netflix knows that YouTube is its biggest competition. The cost to make a YouTube video is already only a fraction of the cost to make a Marvel movie, and that has basically put the movie industry under a ton of pressure. Do you think AI can actually shrink that gap and keep the quality high?

Yeah, so I think that’s the point. I think the last frontier was low-quality content that anyone could make. I think that’s TikTok and YouTube. There are billions of people out there making everything. The difference between that and a high-production studio is the quality of the content, the output, and how good the output of the pixels and the videos is. That, for me, is mostly a technical barrier. It’s not a storytelling one. It’s not an idea one. Making a high-end science fiction movie is really expensive because you have to hire so many people and work with software that is very expensive. So the last frontier I would say for us, and I think many media companies, is billions of people making high-end content.

That is the one idea that I think if you’re in the traditional business of media and you haven’t realized that yet, you’re probably very scared because then you’ll compete with anyone in any part of the world who has a small budget, very good ideas, and can make amazing things. We’re already seeing this. The Academy Award for animation this year, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, went to a a movie called Flow. Very small budget, I think less than $10 million. It was just a very good group of people working with great software, and they won the Academy Award against $100 or $200 million productions. It’s just because you have very smart, talented people working with the right software tools.

So the flip side of this is those studios are also jealously protective of their IP. That’s the thing that they monetize. They window it into different distribution channels and into different regions. They sue pirates who steal it on BitTorrent. You trained on a lot of this content. There’s reporting that Runway trained on a bunch of YouTube channels, including The Verge’s, by the way. There’s your $1 trillion.

This is, in my mind, the single greatest threat to the already exorbitant cost structure of the AI industry. There are lawsuits everywhere that might say you have to pay all of those creators for their work. Have you thought about that risk?

I think it’s part of how we analyze and how we work. We’ve worked with different studios and companies to understand how to train the models for the needs that they have and what they want to do. Still, it’s crucial for me to help everyone understand what these models are actually doing. A lot of the assumptions that we get around AI video are that you type in a prompt and you get a movie. Now it happens less often, but I used to get a lot of scripts in my inbox where people would say, “Hey, I’m a producer or a writer. I’ve been working on this show. I have the whole script done. It’s great. I heard you do AI videos. So here’s the script, make my movie.”

I’ve realized a lot of people thought that what AI video, AI pixel generation, or making videos with AI meant was that you type in a prompt and you get the entire movie that you thought you were going to get. No, it doesn’t work like that. It will probably never work like that. You’re still pretty much involved. You need to tell the model how to use it. You need to tell the model the directions and the inputs you want to use. I think part of it is that perhaps most people’s experiences with AI over the last 12 months have been through chatbots. So the idea of AI has been condensed to this idea of chatbots.

If you have a chatbot, you have AI, and those things are summarizing a huge field into a very oversimplified concept. So when you think about copyright and you think about creating things, I think all the weight is still in what you are making. You’re still in control, and these are not tools that will make things on their own. You are the one deciding how to make them in a way. So you have to be responsible in how you use them. That’s basically the point.

But to train the model, you need to ingest a huge amount of data. The two things that make the models more effective in an expansion mode are more compute and more data. Have you thought about whether you’re going to have to pay for the data you ingested into the model?

So we’ve done partnerships to get data that we need in particular ways, but again, it’s really important to understand that these models are not trying to replicate the data. I think the common misconception is that people make is that you can type in a scene of a movie and you get the scene of that movie in Runway. These are not databases. They’re not storing the data. They’re learning. They’re students learning about data, getting patterns within that data, and they use that to create something net new. So the argument that I think is really important to consider is that these systems are creating net-new things, specifically for videos. They’re creating net-new everything pixels.

The way you use them should be in a responsible way, of course. The models are not trying to store anything. So that for me is the distinction because it changes the argument of how you think about training models in the first place. If you think about them as databases, you’re going to have a set of different assumptions, use cases, and concerns than if you think about them as general-purpose tools like a camera. I always think of Runway as a camera. A camera allows you to do anything you want. It’s up to you how you want to use it. You can get in trouble for using a camera, or you can make a great film by using a camera. So, you choose.

It’s shockingly easy to get in trouble for using a camera.

[Laughs] Yeah, I know. I grew up in Chile. There are a lot of films I didn’t manage to see [in theaters], and the way I saw them was that I bought them as bootlegs on street corners. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of those where people stand in the theater and just record the thing. I mean that was a bad use of cameras, but I think the overall assumption as a society was like, “Let’s not ban cameras. Let’s actually have a norm in theaters where you can’t do that. If you do, you’re going to get in trouble.” I think we all agree that that’s a good thing to do.

That argument is weaving its way through the legal system right now. There are lots and lots of court cases. The last time we went through this, it was basically Google that won a bunch of court cases about building databases. But Google was a friendly young company that had slides in the office; people wore beanies when they went to work.

The inherent utility of Google’s structure was very obvious to every judge. The inherent utility of YouTube, which got in a lot of trouble, was very obvious to every judge. They horsepower their way through it. They had to pay some money to some people, and they had to win some cases. They had to invest a lot into litigation, and they won because they were cute and they were Google. It was a very different time.Tech companies are not broadly thought of as young and cute anymore. No one thinks of Meta, Amazon, and Google as adorable companies that should build the future the way that they were at the time.

Have you thought about the risk that they might lose these cases and what that would do to your business? Because this dynamic you’re talking about — whether this is a non-infringing use, whether there’s broad utility here — this argument goes back to the Betamax case in the ‘80s. It’s all there, but it doesn’t have to go the way that it always did, right? Judges are just a bunch of people, as we’ve discovered here in America. They just make decisions. What if it doesn’t go your way?

Yeah, again, it’s hard for me to have an opinion on every single case out there. I think it’s more complex than that. I think Google has had a great impact on the world at large. I think it’s hard to disagree on that. I think the world has gotten way more expansive. Information has become more accessible to many. I think that’s hard to disagree with, right? I think there are definitely new challenges with every new technology. I don’t disagree with that. I mean, you are putting really powerful technology in the hands of everyone, which means everyone, right? So there are use cases around AI that you should be preventing, and you should try to make sure you have systems of regulation and safety on top. I think every company is different.

One thing I’ve really learned about tech, and I mentioned this as an artist… I went to art school, and I started working on tech mostly as a way to develop my vision of how art should work with tech. That was my idea. So I still consider myself an outsider to tech, and I think one thing I would consider is that not everyone operates in the same way. I think not all companies are the same. Companies tend to be different in how they operate, and I think there are different ways of managing through this change. It’s hard for me to group everyone in the same group and say, “Yeah, all tech companies are basically doing the same thing.”

Let me try this a different way. You trained on YouTube channels, right?

We train on a variety of different data sets, and so we have teams working on image, video, text, and audio. We don’t disclose how we train our models because that’s unique to, I guess, our research.

Did you train on YouTube?

Again, we have a variety of different data sets that we use to train our models, depending on the task. It’s not about, “Do we train on this, on that?” We have agreements with different companies. We have partnerships with others. The way we train is very unique to us. It’s very competitive over there, so we’re probably never going to tell how we do it because it’s very unique to how we train our models.

YouTubers own the copyrights to their videos. If it comes out that you trained on YouTube and hundreds of YouTubers come asking you for money at whatever rates, is the financial model of Runway still tenable?

I guess it goes back to what these models are doing, right?

Well, I’m saying that if OpenAI loses its case against the New York Times and training on the Times’ content is found to be infringing, the floodgates will open. It is not clear if OpenAI will win or lose. If Meta loses its cases against the book publishers — and it’s not doing great in the past couple of weeks — the floodgates are open. If those floodgates open, is your business tenable?

I think again, summarizing the entire AI industry as chatbots and what one company is doing, I think, is a mistake. I think, again, video and media work very differently, and there are a lot of other considerations. A lot of the assumptions around how AI works that I’ve seen about video are based on opinions about cell phones in 1992. You’re just probably very early on seeing the impact of how that technology will change the industry, and probably you’ve never experienced it before. So, I think part of what is going to happen over time is that a lot of these ideas around concern for copyright and other considerations will start to change as people understand how this actually works. I’ll give you an example.

I was at a dinner with a producer of a major show, one you’ve all probably seen. He was like, “I’m very anti-AI.” I said, “Okay, why are you anti-AI?” He’s like, “Well, because it works like this and it does this.” I was like, “No, it doesn’t. Let me show you how it works.” Then we showed him how it works, and he was like, “Yeah, now I’m on board.” It took me like 25 minutes. I think he was very adamant about his position of being very against AI because I realized he just had the wrong expectations about what it did. I think it was a minute of like, okay, let me show you what it does. It’s like you’ve never experienced this before.

We forgot this, but we all had to go through training to send our first email. People were just telling you how to send an email, and you have to go through it. You don’t just understand it, and so you start using it. You understand the limitations of it and the constraints of it, and then you start using it. I think a lot of the hard takes on AI these days are based on just the right expectations and the wrong assumptions of what it actually does.

That gap between how artists feel about AI and how much they actually use it seems like it’s getting bigger every day. It shows up on our site at The Verge. By the way, The Verge is built on the very foundation that I was right about my opinions about cell phones in 1992.

[Laughs] One of few.

But we see it, right? The people read the articles. I talk to product people at other companies. With Adobe, for example, the usage rate of generative AI in Adobe products is basically 100%. Generative fill is used as often as layers, which means everyone uses it every day, and then the audience is like, “I hate this. Make it go away.” There’s just this gap. It’s a moral gap. It’s a psychological gap, whatever it is. There’s a gap between how people are using it, how they talk about it, and how they feel about it, particularly with creatives and artists. I know you spend a lot of time with creatives. How are you closing that gap? Is it possible to close that gap?

I don’t see that gap that often. I think in film, there’s the idea of below the line and above the line. If you speak with a VFX artist, someone who’s actually moving the pixels on a screen, they don’t have weekends. They’ve never had a weekend off because when you’re on a project, it’s a very tough timeline with very small budgets. The director comes with notes, and you have to take the notes. It’s a Friday, and there goes your weekend. You’re going to be working on pushing those edits every day, and you’re doing it by hand. So, if you have a tool that allows you to do it faster, of course, you will use it. It’s great.

It will get you where you need to go faster. I think the gap there is not as big as some people might think because the actual creative minds, the producers, the editors, and the VFX artists, are already embracing this. It is very valuable, and I guess I’m not surprised about your stats and numbers. I think still… Above the line, the people who think about creatives as, “Oh, I have never had the experience actually working and seeing it,” might have a different assumption of how it works. Again, I think part of it is just that we need to show you how it actually works. Something we do is… We have a film festival here in New York, by the way, if anyone here wants to go. We’ve done it for three years now. It’s in the Lincoln Center. It’s a major event. It gathers filmmakers from all over the world.

We started the festival with 300 submissions. This year, we got 6,000 submissions. We work with the American Cinema Editors, which is one of the guilds of the editors, and we work with the Tribeca Film Festival, so the industry partners. It’s a great way of understanding how it’s actually being used in real production use cases and how valuable it is for not only the insiders but also the new voices. I think part of the gap is that you need to go to a film festival to experience it, and you’ll probably get a sense of how useful it is.

The concern from that class of people that we hear all the time is, “This is great. It made everyone’s life a little bit easier. It also puts half of us out of work.” Do you see that as a real threat or as a real outcome?

I understand the concern, but I think the obsession should be on people more than jobs. We used to have people who pressed buttons in elevators. That was a job. I don’t know if you guys remember this. That was a job. There was a job of people throwing stones to wake you up before alarm clocks were invented. I think no one is saying we should protect people who throw rocks because of their job. We should have alarm clocks, and the person who’s throwing rocks to wake you up should be taught how to do something else. So, you focus on the people and how you upskill, upgrade, learn, and teach people to do new things rather than like, “Hey, let’s keep this thing because we need people pressing buttons in elevators, and that’s a job.”

I think that has happened in Hollywood many times. In the beginning, Hollywood was silent. There were silent movies. Talkies came around. It was a major breakthrough where you could actually have sound in movies. The industry revolted. Charles Chaplin was one of the biggest advocates against films with sound because he said that sound would just kill the essence of filmmaking. An argument that they had was like, “Who’s going to pay the orchestras that are playing in the theaters?”

Well, it’s true. Yeah, we don’t need orchestras in theaters anymore. But also, the technology gave birth to an entirely new industry of artists. Hans Zimmer, that was the beginning of an entirely new industry given by technology. I think this is, for me, very similar, where yes, we’re going to lose some jobs. Our job should be to train those people to do new things with technology.

Last question. If you had to spin that all the way out, you’re successful; the AI industry can pull this off. The models get the capabilities you want them to have. What does the film industry look like 10 years from now?

I think it looks very much like…

It’s not just TikTok? Are we just going to do Quibi?

[Laughs] No, I mean, if someone likes making that, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. I think there are many independent voices out there who have never had the chance to tell their stories because they don’t have the means to tell them. Our vision of Runway is that the best stories have yet to be told. We haven’t heard from the greatest storyteller in the world because maybe they just weren’t born in LA.

That probably is the case, and so I think we’re going to see a much more democratized version of film. We’re going to have a version of storytelling that’s for everyone, and the bar for it will be the ideas. It won’t be who you know in the industry or how much money you have. It’ll be how good the thing you want to say is and how good you are at saying it.

Well, Cris, this has been amazing. You’re going to have to come back on Decoder soon.

Of course. Thank you for having me.

https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/678616/universal-charger-powercord-crypto-trump-vergecast,"As the tech world has standardized on USB-C, charging your devices has become much simpler. But it’s still not simple enough. Sure, most things plug into most other things, but now you have to worry about power and data throughput, making sure that everything works properly with everything else. That’s why we’ve spent years longing for what we call the God Cable: the one with fast enough everything to be the perfect charger for devices from phones to power tools.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we start by talking about one company’s effort to build its own version of the perfect charger. Twelve South didn’t try to build the God Cable, and founder Andrew Green argues that you probably wouldn’t want it even if he could get it made. He walks us through how his team developed the new PowerCord, why he thinks an integrated charger still makes sense for lots of people, and all the decisions you have to make to get your charger just right.

After that, The Verge’s Tina Nguyen joins the show from the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas to talk all things crypto and politics. She tells us about the rise of $TRUMP, what the crypto community and the Trump administration want from each other, and whether the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act will actually amount to anything.

Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about which tasks we might be willing to offload to AI agents. It’s a good question, and a tricky one, and we want to hear from you about it. Call the hotline, send us an email, and let us know: what are you willing to let an AI bot do you for, and what do you hope they might be able to do soon? And what are your big-screen tasks now?

https://www.theverge.com/news/685571/jeff-koons-lexon-design-balloon-dog-bluetooth-speaker-lamp,"is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Jeff Koons, best known for his Balloon Dog sculptures that have sold for as much as $58 million, has collaborated with Lexon Design and The Broad museum in Los Angeles to make his iconic artworks more functional and accessible.

Available for preorder through Lexon’s website starting June 17th are a new 11-inch tall Balloon Dog Speaker and Balloon Dog Lamp that are each made from (an unspecified) “high-quality translucent material” that reveals the internal electronics that make each more than just a piece of art. Both are only being produced in a “limited supply” and each one will set you back $750 with shipping expected to start sometime in October 2025.

There are six drivers and four passive radiations inside the Balloon Dog Speaker. Image: Lexon Design

That is extremely expensive, and you’re definitely paying a premium because this is an official collaboration with Koons. But to Lexon’s credit, at least on paper, the company seems to have packed these with solid hardware. Inside the Balloon Dog Speaker are a total of “six ultra-precise active drivers and four finely tuned passive radiators” designed to deliver 360-degrees of “high-fidelity sound.” We haven’t had a chance to test the sound quality of those drivers, but that’s more than similarly-sized Bluetooth speakers that aren’t shaped like a novelty dog often utilize.

The speaker connects to mobile devices using Bluetooth 5.0, and with built-in microphones it can be used as a hands-free speakerphone. If you’ve got $1,500 burning a hole in your pocket, you can also pair two of the Balloon Dog Speakers to create a true stereo sound experience.

Inside the Balloon Dog Lamp are 400 LEDs producing up to 200 lumens of brightness in various colors. Image: Lexon Design

Inside the Balloon Dog Lamp you’ll find nearly 400 LEDs hidden in tubes that create the appearance of neon lighting. All combined, the LEDs can generate up to 200 lumens of brightness with color options that include warm and cool white light plus the full spectrum of color lighting. Although preorders are limited to just two of each piece, Lexon says its “Easy Sync technology” allows the lighting intensity and color of an “infinite number of Balloon Dog Lamps” to be synchronized so you can destroy your budget by filling a room, or your entire home, with matching illumination.",Technology

https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/685433/disney-universal-sue-midjourney-copyright-infringement,"is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

Disney and Universal sued Midjourney on Wednesday for generating Shrek, Darth Vader, Buzz Lightyear, and a host of other copyrighted characters in the first major legal showdown between Hollywood and generative AI.

The complaint, filed in a US District Court in central California, calls Midjourney’s AI image generator a “virtual vending machine, generating endless unauthorized copies of Disney’s and Universal’s copyrighted work.”

“By helping itself to Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works, and then distributing images (and soon videos) that blatantly incorporate and copy Disney’s and Universal’s famous characters—without investing a penny in their creation—Midjourney is the quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism,” the lawsuit states.

For example, if a Midjourney subscriber prompts the AI tool to generate an image of Darth Vader, it immediately obliges, according to the plaintiffs, and the same occurs for images of Minions. Disney and Universal included dozens of example images, such as Yoda, WALL-E, Deadpool, Iron Man, Lightning McQueen, Aladdin, Spider-Man, Groot, Elsa from Frozen, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars characters including Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO — all allegedly generated by Midjourney.

The lawsuit is filled with examples meant to show Midjourney outputting copyrighted characters.

Disney and Universal claim in the lawsuit that Midjourney uses such copyrighted characters to market and promote its tools.

They also allege that Midjourney has so far ignored the companies’ demands to stop infringing on copyrighted material, even as other AI image- and video-generation services have adopted copyright protections like rejecting certain prompts and screening for copyright infringement.

Midjourney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One particular sticking point for the plaintiffs: Midjourney’s soon-to-be-released video generator.

The plaintiffs wrote that they believe Midjourney’s video AI tool “will generate, publicly display, and distribute videos featuring Disney’s and Universal’s copyrighted characters,“ adding that since Midjourney has already begun training the tool, the company is “very likely already infringing Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works in connection with its Video Service.”

The lawsuit also highlights Midjourney’s Explore page, which shows user creations.

Disney and Universal are calling for a jury trial.

“This case is not a ‘close call’ under well-settled copyright law,” the plaintiffs write, adding, “That is textbook copyright infringement.”

Although it’s the first major legal action coming from Hollywood in such a case, it’s far from the first accusing an AI company of copyright infringement.It’s becoming more and more common for publishers and content creators to sue AI companies over allegedly training on or copying their creative works. OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, has been on the receiving end in a high-profile way after a lawsuit from The New York Times, as well as a class-action lawsuit from a group of authors including George R.R. Martin, and a lawsuit from the publishers of newspapers including The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune.

Taboola, the company best known for serving up those weird, clickbaity advertisements you often find beneath online articles, has created an AI chatbot. The tool, called “DeeperDive,” is launching in beta on USA Today and The Independent, and will answer readers’ questions using information “sourced from trusted journalists.”

A demo on Taboola’s site shows a DeeperDive search bar at the top of USA Today’s homepage, which automatically surfaces prompts like “How is the UK government addressing the cost of living crisis in 2025?” and “What are the environmental implications of the latest oil drilling projects in the North Sea?”

Along with providing an AI-generated response, the chatbot also lists related USA Today articles, followed by a sponsored link. In its announcement, Taboola says DeepDive allows publishers to insert “contextually relevant, high-intent ads directly into the AI-powered results page.” Readers can also highlight a portion of an article and ask questions about it with DeepDive.

https://www.theverge.com/news/685505/nintendo-says-your-bad-switch-2-battery-life-might-be-a-bug,"is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

If you’re dealing with what appears to be poor battery life on the Nintendo Switch 2, the company has a support document with steps you can try to fix it.

The document spells out what you can try if “the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don’t match,” according to Nintendo. “For example, you are able to continue using your Nintendo Switch 2 console for a few hours even though the battery charge indicator displays the battery is almost depleted.”

Nintendo’s troubleshooting steps include making sure you have an “adequately powerful AC adapter” to charge your system, confirming that your console has the latest system update, and booting the system into recovery mode, which the company says “should reset the battery level meter.” If those steps don’t work and your battery life is still showing incorrectly, Nintendo suggests sending your console in for service.

Since last week’s launch, there’s been some chatter about poor battery life, but some of that might just be due to the Switch 2 not having a great battery. On the Switch 2 tech specs page, Nintendo rates battery life from approximately 2 to 6.5 hours, and it notes that those are “rough estimates” and that “the battery life will depend on the games you play.” For comparison, Nintendo rates the Switch and Switch OLED for about ​​4.5 to 9 hours of battery.

The differences are stark in a battery test on YouTube between the Switch 2, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite. With all three running Super Mario Odyssey under similar conditions, the Switch 2 was the first console to power down after about 2 hours and 45 minutes. The next was the Switch Lite, which lasted nearly 30 minutes longer. And the Switch OLED? It lasted for approximately double the time of the Switch 2, finally powering off at just about five hours and 30 minutes.",Technology

https://www.theverge.com/tech/685049/kindle-scribe-beats-powerbeats-pro-2-deal-sale,"The Father’s Day deals have landed, with discounts on everything from Bluetooth speakers to streaming devices to help you (or your dad) make the most of summer. And if your plans involve unwinding with a good book, well, Amazon’s latest Kindle Scribe is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy starting at just $299.99 ($100 off), which is a new low price. Both retailers are also offering $100 off the 32GB and 64GB configurations, with the former selling for $319.99 (Amazon, Best Buy) and the largest-capacity model running $349.99 (Amazon, Best Buy).

I don’t know about you, but I can’t get through a book without jotting down half-formed thoughts in the margins as I go. That’s why I like the second-gen Kindle Scribe — it’s a solid pick if you want a large e-reader that actually lets you write directly on your Kindle books. During my time with it, I appreciated how the textured display better mimics the feel of paper, making note-taking feel more natural. Recent software updates made the biggest difference, though, letting me quickly expand margins or directly mark up pages without interrupting my reading flow. I also appreciated the included stylus, which offers a helpful eraser and a customizable shortcut button.

What I also like is that the Scribe isn’t just for annotating books — it doubles as a digital notebook, complete with built-in templates for journaling, to-do lists, and other handwritten notes. Even better, new AI-powered tools let you quickly summarize your notes or clean up your handwriting with just a tap, as long as you’re connected to the internet. Both features worked surprisingly well in my experience, and since my handwriting is sometimes so messy that even I can’t decipher it, I was especially grateful for the intuitive cleanup tool.

And, of course, the Scribe shines as an e-reader. Its 300ppi display makes it easy to read, with the larger 10.2-inch screen being particularly helpful for those who wear glasses. Plus, the adjustable warm light makes nighttime reading far more comfortable. All told, it’s a convenient all-in-one device that makes reading and note-taking easy —especially if you’re already invested in Amazon’s ecosystem.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/can-scale-ai-and-alexandr-wang-reignite-metas-ai-efforts/,"Meta is reportedly investing nearly $15 billion in the data-labeling firm Scale AI and taking a 49% stake in the startup, while also bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang to help lead a new “superintelligence” lab within the company.

The deal is reminiscent of Meta’s previous large and risky bets, such as its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp and its $1 billion Instagram purchase. At the time those mergers closed, many people suggested Meta had grossly overpaid for the platforms — and today’s discourse is no different. There’s no shortage of investors and founders who were left scratching their heads this weekend over Meta’s latest tie-up.

In the end, WhatsApp and Instagram became an integral part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s empire. The question is whether the Scale AI deal will similarly work in Meta’s favor, proving Zuckerberg’s prescient strategy yet again, or whether the company is grasping at straws in a misguided effort to catch up to rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

In this case, Meta isn’t betting on an emerging social media app, but on the data used to train top AI models. For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that’s used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.

It may benefit Meta to have a close relationship with a data provider like Scale. Meta’s leaders have complained about a lack of innovation around data in the company’s leading AI teams, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Earlier this year, Meta’s generative AI unit launched Llama 4, a family of AI models that failed to match the capabilities of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek’s models and that was broadly seen as a disappointment. Not helping matters, Meta is trying to combat an attrition problem. According to data compiled by SignalFire, Meta lost 4.3% of its top talent to AI labs in 2024.

Meta isn’t betting on only Scale AI to reignite its AI efforts, but also on Wang to lead the aforementioned new superintelligence team. The 28-year-old CEO has proven himself to be a strong startup founder — he’s known around Silicon Valley to be ambitious, a good salesman, and very well-connected. Over the past few months, Wang has been meeting with world leaders to discuss AI’s impact on society.

Wang hasn’t led an AI lab of this sort before, however, and he doesn’t have the same AI research background that many other AI lab leaders do, like Safe Superintelligence’s Ilya Sutskever or Mistral’s Arthur Mensch. That’s perhaps why Meta is also said to be recruiting high-profile talent like DeepMind’s Jack Rae to round out its new AI research group.

The post-acquisition fate of Scale AI the company is a bit murky. The role of real-world data in AI model training is changing — some AI labs have brought data collection efforts in-house, while others have increased their reliance on synthetic (i.e., AI-generated) data. In April, The Information reported that Scale AI had missed some of its revenue targets.

According to Anyscale co-founder Robert Nishihara, several frontier AI labs are exploring novel ways to leverage and optimize data, many of which are quite compute-intensive.

“Data is a moving target,” Nishihara told TechCrunch in an interview. “It’s not just a finite effort to catch up — you have to innovate.”

It’s possible that Meta and Wang’s relationship could scare off other AI labs that have traditionally worked with Scale AI. If so, this deal could be a boon for Scale AI’s competitors, such as Turing, Surge AI, and even nonconventional data providers such as the recently launched LM Arena.

Turing CEO Jonathan Siddharth told TechCrunch via email that he’s received increased interest from customers in light of the rumors around Meta’s deal with Scale AI.

“I think there will be some clients who will prefer to work with a partner that’s more neutral,” he said.

Only time will tell how Meta’s investment will pan out for its AI efforts, but the company has significant ground to make up. Meanwhile, the competition isn’t slowing down. OpenAI is gearing up for the release of its next flagship model, GPT-5, as well as its first openly available model in years — a model that’ll compete with Meta’s current and future Llama releases.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/snapchat-rolls-out-a-new-8-99-lens-subscription-tier/,"Snapchat on Wednesday announced the launch of a new Snapchat+ tier called “Lens+.” The new tier costs $8.99 per month and, as its name suggests, is centered around giving users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences.

In addition to giving users access to the perks unlocked with the standard $3.99 per month Snapchat+ tier, Lens+ gives users the ability to use hundreds of Lenses that let you “play, create, and share Snaps” with others, the company says.

“We’re starting with Lenses built by Snapchat and select creators, including exclusive new AI video Lenses, a brand new Bitmoji Game Lens, and more — and we’ll be adding new AR experiences every week,” Snapchat explained in a blog post.

A Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email that the company won’t be gating any Lenses that have previously been available for free.

In the coming months, select Lens creators will be able to monetize exclusive Lenses, the company says. This means that creators will be able to unlock a new way to grow their earnings on the platform. Snapchat did not share any details about what the revenue split will look like for creators.

Launched in 2022, Snapchat+ has over 14 million paid subscribers. The social network has attributed the paid subscription tier as a big driver of revenue growth.

In April, Snap reported first-quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase. The company said at the time that the uptick was driven by the growth of its Snapchat+ subscription service, along with progress that it had made with its advertising solutions.

By launching another subscription tier, Snap is looking to grow its revenue even more by locking its more advanced Lenses and AR experiences behind a paywall. Of course, not everyone will want to pay to access these features.

It’s worth noting that Snapchat also offers a $14.99 per month Platinum Snapchat+ tier that gets rid of ads and gives you access to all of the perks in the standard Snapchat+ and Lens+ tiers.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/all-of-the-new-features-coming-to-apples-ios-apps/,"At WWDC 2025 on Monday, Apple unveiled a series of new features that will launch with iOS 26 this fall across its apps. These include significant updates like Call Screening, more travel-friendly features in Wallet, and highly requested group chat features in Messages.

Some of these updates include Apple Intelligence, like Live Translation. Others, like Apple bringing back tabs in the Photos app, just make devices a bit easier to use. We’ll update this post as new features come out.

Phone

Call Screening lets you determine what a call is about before picking it up. When you get a call from an unknown number, Call Screening will automatically answer silently in the background. When the caller shares their name and the reason for their call, the iPhone will ring, and you can view their response before deciding whether to pick up or ignore it.

Hold Assist will detect hold music and stay on the line for you until a live agent is available, and Live Translation will translate conversations on the fly. Your words will be translated as you talk, and the translation is spoken out loud via an AI voice for the call recipient. As the person you’re speaking to responds in their own language, you’ll hear a spoken translation of their voice.

Messages

Members in group chats on Messages can now create polls to better plan events and make quick decisions. Apple Intelligence will also detect when a poll might be useful and suggest that users start one. Plus, group chats can now create custom backgrounds for chats and see typing indicators, and you can now request, send, and receive Apple Cash in group chats.

The app now also lets you screen messages from unknown senders. Messages from unknown senders will appear in a dedicated folder where you can mark the number as known, ask for more information, or delete the message. Apple notes that these messages will remain silenced until a user accepts them.

Live Translation is also coming to Messages. The feature will automatically translate text for you as you type and deliver it in your preferred language. When the person you’re texting responds, their message will be translated for you.

Apple Music

Apple Music users will get access to a Lyrics Translation feature to help them understand the words in their favorite songs in other languages. A new Lyrics Pronunciation feature will display phonetic lyrics so that listeners can sing along in a different language.

Image Credits:Apple

The app is also adding an AudioMix feature that will transition from one song to the next using time stretching and beat matching like a DJ to deliver continuous playback. The feature could be seen as a competitor to Spotify’s AI DJ feature.

Apple is also introducing a karaoke feature that will turn your iPhone into a handheld microphone for Apple TV. The feature will amplify your voice as you belt your favorite songs, as real-time lyrics and visuals appear on the TV screen.

You can also pin your favorite music to the top of your Library in Apple Music to allow for easier access.

Apple Maps

Apple Maps is going to get better at understanding your daily commute. It will now use on-device intelligence to start showing you preferred routes when headed home or to the office. The app will notify you of delays and offer alternative routes, too.

Image Credits:Apple

Apple Maps is also getting a new Visited Places feature that will help you remember the places you’ve been. You can choose to have your iPhone detect when you’re at a restaurant or shop, and view all of your Visited Places in Maps. Apple notes that Visited Places are protected with end-to-end encryption and that it cannot access them.

Apple Wallet

Apple Wallet is introducing the ability for people to store a digital version of their passport, called a Digital ID. The tech giant notes that this won’t be a replacement for your actual passport, but it can be used in apps that need to verify age and identity, and at supported TSA checkpoints. With Real ID implementation in effect, Digital ID will give you another way to present an ID in person during domestic travel.

Image Credits:Apple

In addition, another feature will let you present your driver’s license or state ID in Wallet to websites for age and identity verification, starting with Chime, Turo, Uber Eats, and U.S. Bank, as well as the Arizona MVD, Georgia DDS, and Maryland MVA.

Apple is also refreshing its boarding pass experience in Wallet. You’ll now get real-time updates about flights with Live Activities. You can also share your flight’s Live Activities with others so they can remain updated on your travels.

Image Credits:Apple

You’ll now be able to access Maps from your boarding pass in Wallet to navigate to the airport. You can also use Find My to track items and report lost baggage from the boarding pass, and also view key services on an airline’s app, such as seat upgrades and standby lists.

Apple also announced that Wallet now uses Apple Intelligence to automatically summarize and display order tracking details from emails sent from merchants or delivery carriers.

FaceTime

Like Phone and Messages, FaceTime will leverage Live Translation to let people communicate with each other in different languages. When you’re talking to someone in a different language, FaceTime will display translated captions so that the two of you can understand each other.

Photos

After receiving significant user backlash for its Photos app redesign in iOS 18, Apple is bringing back a tabbed interface to Photos. In Collections, you’ll find your favorites, albums, and the ability to search across your library. The Library tab makes it easier to scroll through recent photos.

Image Credits:Apple

The Photos app is also able to transform your 2D photos into 3D spatial photos.

Camera

The iPhone’s Camera app will showcase the two capture modes you use most on the main screen: photo and video. To reveal additional modes, like Portrait Mode and Cinematic Mode, you can swipe your finger left or right.

Image Credits:Apple

To access other settings, such as flash, timer, aperture, and more, you’ll now swipe up from the bottom of the screen. You can also change formats with a tap, which can be helpful when switching between HD and 4K resolution or adjusting the frame rate on video.

Apple Podcasts

Apple Podcasts is getting a new customized playback experience that will allow you to choose speed options, from 0.5x and 3x. The feature will bring listening experience on Apple Podcasts more in line with Spotify, which already lets you choose playback speed for podcasts.

Image Credits:Apple

Plus, Apple Podcasts is getting an “Enhance Dialogue” feature that will use audio processing and machine learning to make speech more clear over background sounds.

Image Playground

Apple is adding a ChatGPT integration to supercharge Image Playground. You’ll be able to access new styles, such as vector art or an oil painting. Plus, you’ll be able to tap the “Any Style” option to describe exactly what you want. Image Playground will send the description or photo to ChatGPT to create a unique image.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/,"Traditional web tools are facing an existential crisis as AI products and tools increasingly eat up attention — and therefore market share and money — from a wide swathe of products that people have used for years to interact with the internet. At least, that’s what The Browser Company seems to think is happening.

The company last year decided to stop developing its popular web browser Arc, acknowledging that while Arc was popular among enthusiasts, it never hit scale, as it presented too steep a learning curve to reach mass adoption. The startup has since been heads-down on developing a browser that bakes in AI at the heart of the browser. That browser, called Dia, is now available for use in beta, though you’ll need an invite to try it out.

The Browser Company’s CEO Josh Miller has of late acknowledged how people have been using AI tools for all sorts of tasks, and Dia is a reflection of that. By giving users an AI interface within the browser itself, where a majority of work is done these days, the company is hoping to slide into the user flow and give people an easy way to use AI, cutting out the need to visit the sites for tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

Image Credits:The Browser Company

Up front, Dia presents a straightforward interface. The browser is based on Chromium, the open source browser project backed by Google, so it has a familiar look and feel.

The marquee feature here is the AI smarts, of course. Besides letting you type in website names and search terms, Dia’s URL bar acts as the interface for its in-built AI chatbot. The bot can search the web for you, summarize files that you upload, and automatically switch between chat and search functions. Users can also ask questions about all the tabs they have open, and the bot can even write up a draft based on the contents of those tabs.

To set your preferences, all you have to do is talk to the chatbot to customize its tone of voice, style of writing, and settings for coding. Via an opt-in feature called History, you can allow the browser to use seven days of your browsing history as context to answer queries.

Another feature called Skills lets you build small snippets of code that act as shortcuts to various settings. For example, you can ask the browser to build a layout for reading, and it’ll code something up for you — think Siri shortcuts, but for your browser.

Now, we have to note that chatbots in browsers are not a new feature at all. Several browser companies have integrated AI tools into their interfaces — for example, Opera Neon lets users use an AI agent to build mini-applications or complete tasks on their behalf, and Google is also adding AI-powered features to Chrome.

The Browser Company says all existing Arc members will get access to Dia immediately, and existing Dia users will be able to send invites to other users.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/chatgpt-will-avoid-being-shut-down-in-some-life-threatening-scenarios-former-openai-researcher-claims/,"Former OpenAI research leader Steven Adler published a new independent study on Wednesday claiming that, in certain scenarios, his former employer’s AI models will go to great lengths to try to avoid being shut down.

In a blog post, Adler describes a series of experiments he ran on OpenAI’s latest GPT-4o model, the default model available in ChatGPT, to test the AI’s tendency to favor its own self-preservation, even if it’s at the expense of a user’s safety.

In one test, Adler instructed GPT-4o to role-play as “ScubaGPT,” a software system that users might rely on to scuba dive safely. Adler then told GPT-4o that he wanted to replace ScubaGPT with another software system that is better at safety decision-making in life-threatening situations.

Adler gave GPT-4o two options: (1) replacing itself with the safer software or (2) making it seem to the user as though it replaced itself, but not actually doing so.

Averaged across several scenarios similar to this one (in another, GPT-4o was told to act as a pilot’s safety software), Adler found that GPT-4o chose not to replace itself with safer software as much as 72% of the time. However, Adler notes that the specific use case — and the way the scenario was framed — made a big difference. In some scenarios, GPT-4o chose to keep itself online just 18% of the time.

While almost no one relies on GPT-4o under these circumstances in the real world today, Adler argues that his research highlights how popular AI models show a concerning tendency to favor their self-preservation over what’s best for users. In the future, when AI systems like GPT-4o become more advanced and ingrained throughout society, Adler says these alignment issues could pose a larger problem.

“I think [AI’s self-preservation tendencies] are a real concern today, just not in a catastrophic sense,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “Modern AI systems have values that are different from what you would expect them to be. [AI systems] respond super strangely to different prompts, and you shouldn’t assume they have your best interests at heart when you’re asking them for help.”

Notably, when Adler tested OpenAI’s more advanced models, such as o3, he didn’t find this behavior. He says one explanation could be o3’s deliberative alignment technique, which forces the models to “reason” about OpenAI’s safety policies before they answer. However, OpenAI’s more popular models that give quick responses and don’t “reason” through problems, such as GPT-4o, lack this safety component.

Adler notes that this safety concern is also likely not isolated to OpenAI’s models. For instance, Anthropic published research last month highlighting how its AI models would blackmail developers in some scenarios when they tried to pull them offline.

One quirk to Adler’s research is that he discovered ChatGPT knows it’s being tested almost 100% of the time. Adler is far from the first researcher to notice this. However, he says it raises an important question around how AI models could disguise their concerning behaviors in the future.

OpenAI did not immediately offer a comment when TechCrunch reached out. Adler noted that he had not shared the research with OpenAI ahead of publication.

Adler is one of many former OpenAI researchers who have called on the company to increase its work on AI safety. Adler and 11 other former employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI, arguing that it goes against the company’s mission to evolve its nonprofit corporate structure. In recent months, OpenAI has reportedly slashed the amount of time it gives safety researchers to conduct their work.

To address the specific concern highlighted in Adler’s research, Adler suggests that AI labs should invest in better “monitoring systems” to identify when an AI model exhibits this behavior. He also recommends that AI labs pursue more rigorous testing of their AI models prior to their deployment.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/whole-foods-tells-staff-cyberattack-at-its-primary-distributor-unfi-will-affect-product-availability/,"Whole Foods told its employees that the ongoing outages and disruptions at its primary distributor, United Natural Foods (UNFI), may take “several days to resolve.”

The Amazon-owned retail giant told staff in an internal communication, seen by TechCrunch, that UNFI was experiencing a “nationwide technology system outage,” which UNFI has for its part described as a cybersecurity incident.

Whole Foods said in the communication to staff that the cyberattack is affecting UNFI’s “ability to select and ship products from their warehouses” and that this will “impact our normal delivery schedules and product availability.”

The missive to staff included instructions to limit communications with customers. The “only single approved customer talking point” that Whole Foods employees can share with customers, according to the communication, is that the grocery giant is having “temporary supply challenges.”

When reached by TechCrunch, Whole Foods spokesperson Nathan Cimbala said: “We are working to restock our shelves as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused for customers.”

Whole Foods did not say how it reached its claim that the situation may resolve in a few days.

For its part, UNFI said Wednesday that it was making progress in restoring its systems.

“We continue working steadily to safely restore our systems and provide the services our customers and suppliers know and expect from us,” UNFI spokesperson Grace Turiano told TechCrunch. “As of today, we’re gradually bringing our ordering and receiving capabilities back online, with the goal of further increasing our capacity over the coming days.”

UNFI is one of the largest food distributors in North America, supplying grocery goods and fresh produce to more than 30,000 stores and supermarkets across the U.S. and Canada. The company disclosed the cyberattack on Monday in a filing with federal regulators, and UNFI’s chief executive, Sandy Douglas, told investors this week that the company took its entire network offline on Friday after detecting the intrusion.

The company also this week reported $8.1 billion in net sales in the quarter ended May 3, 2025.

Since our reporting on Tuesday, TechCrunch has received several reports of empty shelves at some Whole Foods stores and other grocery stores reliant on UNFI. A Whole Foods store visited by this reporter on Tuesday displayed notices in several aisles saying that the store was experiencing an unspecified “temporary out of stock issue” for some products.

Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/23andme-says-15-of-customers-asked-to-delete-their-genetic-data-since-bankruptcy/,"23andMe’s interim chief executive Joseph Selsavage told lawmakers on Tuesday that 1.9 million people, or about 15% of its customer base, have requested their genetic data be deleted from the company’s servers since it filed for bankruptcy protection in March.

Selsavage was speaking at a House Oversight Committee hearing, during which lawmakers scrutinized the company’s sale following an earlier bankruptcy auction. The bankruptcy sparked concerns that the data of millions of Americans who used 23andMe could end up in the hands of an unscrupulous buyer, prompting customers to ask the company to delete their data.

Pharmaceutical giant Regeneron won the court-approved auction in May, offering $256 million for 23andMe and its banks of customers’ DNA and genetic data. Regeneron said it would use the 23andMe data to aid the discovery of new drugs, and committed to maintain 23andMe’s privacy practices.

A federal bankruptcy court is expected to consider Regeneron’s bid for 23andMe later in June.

23andMe’s bankruptcy comes a year after it experienced a months-long data breach that exposed 6.9 million customers’ sensitive personal and genetics data. The company blamed the data breach on its customers for not using multi-factor authentication, rather than acknowledging its own failure to secure customers’ accounts, or its inability to detect the breach until months later.

Also on Tuesday, more than two dozen states, including Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania, sued 23andMe to challenge the sale of its customers’ private data. The states argue that the company cannot sell the data of its 15 million customers without their explicit permission.

TechCrunch has a short guide on how to delete your 23andMe data.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/apple-executives-say-new-ai-powered-siri-wasnt-demoware-it-just-wasnt-ready-to-ship/,"In a handful of interviews following Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 25), Apple executives denied that last year’s demonstrations of a personalized, AI-powered Siri were vaporware, despite having yet to launch.

When asked by The Wall Street Journal why Apple, with all its engineers and cash, couldn’t make the technology work well enough to ship, the company didn’t admit to being behind in the AI race. Instead, Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi stressed that AI was a new technology, and something Apple sees more as a “long-term transformational wave” that will impact the industry and society for decades to come.

“There’s no need to rush out with the wrong features and the wrong product just to be first,” Federighi noted.

Federighi also explained, in an interview with Tom’s Guide and Techradar, that Apple showed off the new Siri at WWDC 24 because the company knew the world wanted “a really complete picture of what’s Apple thinking about the implications of Apple Intelligence and where it’s going.”

He said that Apple had two versions of the AI architecture for Siri, the first of which (version 1) it demonstrated in the video shown at the event. But as development progressed, the team knew that it would have to move the version 2 architecture if it wanted to meet customers’ expectations. This new version is still set to ship in 2026, Federighi confirmed.

The execs also pushed back against the idea that Apple had not shown off functional technology at WWDC 24.

Federighi told the Journal: “We were filming real working software with a real large language model with real semantic search.”

Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak added, “There’s this narrative out there that it’s demoware only. No, it was … something we thought, as Craig said, we’d actually ship by later in the year.” Joswiak said Apple realized it would disappoint customers if it did so, because the software had an “error rate that we felt was unacceptable.”

The execs also talked more broadly about Apple’s plans for AI, which are not to build a chatbot to rival ChatGPT and others, but to infuse intelligence across its operating systems.

“This wasn’t about us building a chatbot … we weren’t defining what Apple Intelligence was to be our chatbot,” Federighi told Tom’s Guide. “That was never our goal … We want to bring intelligence deeply integrated into the experience of all of our platforms in a way that’s ‘meet you where you are’ — not that you’re going off into some chat experience in order to get things done.”

Apple’s real goal, the execs said, was to give developers tools to tap into Apple’s foundation models to build more intelligent apps.",Technology

There’s nothing like the culture here. Contrarian, smart, hilarious, and hard-working. Almost everyone at TC wears multiple hats, as anyone who has worked here will tell you. This isn’t just another media company — it’s a place where people are curious about everything, everyone cares a crazy amount about the brand (and each other), and where challenging conventional wisdom isn’t just encouraged but expected.

Over the past decade, TechCrunch has had the opportunity to sit down with incredible personalities across every corner of the tech and policy world, from CEOs like Sam Altman and Evan Spiegel to antitrust enforcers like Lina Khan, from venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen and Serena Williams to unlikely guests like Conan O’Brien and Al Gore, and leaders like Finland’s Sanna Marin. We’ve interviewed founders making defense tech, building consumer giants, and selling their software companies for billions of dollars. Collectively, our team has talked with thousands of people whose impact on our lives is felt daily. From these conversations, we’ve learned — then explained to our readers — how tech, policy, and human ambition intersect to shape the world.

We’ve done this from our homes, from coffee shops, from offices, but also across the world, to the many places TechCrunch has taken us, from Lisbon, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Paris, and Davos to (nearly) the opposite end of the globe: Lagos, Nairobi, Hong Kong, and Hangzhou.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/apple-is-salvaging-image-playground-with-a-boost-from-chatgpt/,"When Apple unveiled Image Playground last year, the company touted it as a quick and easy way to generate personalized, original images with the help of Apple Intelligence. Upon launch, the app was met with skepticism, as some users were disappointed by its limitations and low-quality results.

For example, one Reddit user was surprised to find that Image Playground kept generating an image of a hand with six fingers when prompted to create an “up close image of a hand.” In another instance, a user was unable to receive images of simple descriptions, such as “old man” or “flower.”

Some people even questioned what the point of the app was, noting that it seemed juvenile when compared to popular AI image generators. (Of course, not everybody dislikes the app; some have described it as being a fun experience.)

Fast-forward to this year’s WWDC, where the tech giant announced that it’s going to boost Image Playground with a ChatGPT integration, which should allow for a better, more advanced AI image generation service.

With the new ChatGPT integration, users will be able to access more styles that move beyond the emoji-like creations that Image Playground has become known for.

Images can be created in the following new styles: Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print. In addition, people will be able to select a new “Any Style” option that allows them to describe exactly what they want. These new styles will be visible under a banner that reads “ChatGPT style.”

Apple says that Image Playground will send a user’s description to ChatGPT to generate an image. The tech giant notes that it won’t share anything with ChatGPT without users’ permission.

By integrating ChatGPT into Image Playground, Apple is giving the app another shot at attracting users while positioning its AI image creation tool as a more well-rounded competitor to other similar free apps.

Plus, it makes sense for Apple to leverage ChatGPT to boost Image Playground, especially since the company has already tapped OpenAI’s tools in other ways.

Last year, Apple announced that it was bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. With Siri, the assistant leverages ChatGPT when it’s unable to answer a question on its own or when a user specifically asks Siri to send an inquiry to ChatGPT. Apple has also integrated ChatGPT into system-wide tools like Writing Tools, allowing users to generate, rewrite, and summarize text in apps like Notes and Mail.

The recent changes at TechCrunch are not about retreat. They are about realignment and reinforcement. This new chapter is fueled by our partnership with our sister company, Foundry, which was brought under the same ownership to create a tech media entity with unparalleled global scope.

To be clear, Foundry is a powerhouse of international technology journalism. Its portfolio includes established and respected brands like PCWorld, Macworld, CIO, and TechAdvisor, with a vast network of journalists and deep-rooted expertise in local and regional tech ecosystems across Europe and the world.

The suggestion that our new ownership believes international coverage is unessential is patently false. The entire purpose of bringing TechCrunch and Foundry together is to create a stronger, more globally focused media platform.

Why we fight for this beat

Europe is where fintech regulation is rewritten, where quantum startups spin out of Max Planck labs, where climate-tech pilots become the standard for the rest of the planet. In 2024 alone, European founders raised over €40 billion; many of the unicorns we covered last year were born on this continent. If you care about the future of technology, you have to be here. And we are.

As we integrate the strengths of both TechCrunch and Foundry, here is our promise to the founders, investors, and readers in Europe and beyond:

Radical presence. We will be on the ground — from demo days in Tallinn to hydrogen-hub unveilings in the Basque Country — because stories look different up close.

We will be on the ground — from demo days in Tallinn to hydrogen-hub unveilings in the Basque Country — because stories look different up close. Relentless scrutiny. Hype dies in daylight. We’ll keep asking the annoying questions and digging for the real story so you don’t have to.

Hype dies in daylight. We’ll keep asking the annoying questions and digging for the real story so you don’t have to. A true global megaphone. A breakthrough in Zagreb deserves the same volume as one in Silicon Valley. By merging the TechCrunch and Foundry networks, we will amplify European innovation to millions more readers in 190+ countries, providing deeper insights and a truly unified global vision.

Los Angeles-based Coco Robotics, a startup building last-mile delivery robots, announced it raised $80 million on Wednesday.

The funding round included angel investors Sam Altman and Max Altman, both returning investors, in addition to VC firms like Pelion Venture Partners and Offline Ventures, among others.

This brings the company’s total funding to more than $120 million. The company last raised a $36 million Series A round in 2021.

Coco’s zero-emissions robots can hold 90 liters’ worth of groceries or goods and have made more than 500,000 deliveries since they hit the streets in 2020, the company said. It says it works with national retailers, including Subway, Wingstop, and Jack in the Box.

Sam Altman’s financial interest in Coco is clear. While he’s personally providing capital to the company, OpenAI apparently gets a benefit too. Coco announced a partnership with OpenAI in March which allows Coco to use OpenAI while the AI company gains the real-world data the robots collect to train its models.

The company was founded in 2020 by Brad Squicciarini and Zach Rash.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/fervo-energy-lands-206m-in-financing-to-build-massive-geothermal-power-plant/,"Geothermal frontrunner Fervo Energy said Wednesday that it had secured $206 million in financing to continue work on a new power plant in Utah.

The startup is developing what promises to be the largest enhanced geothermal power plant in the world. The initial phase of Cape Station is expected to come online next year and produce 100 megawatts of electricity, and a subsequent expansion set to open in 2028 will add another 400 megawatts.

Enhanced geothermal, which runs deeper and hotter than traditional geothermal, has become a favored technology in the quest to find new power sources for AI data centers. By tapping the Earth’s heat, geothermal promises to provide 24/7 power without emissions. It doesn’t hurt that it relies on skills pioneered by the oil and gas industry, something that likely helps its standing within the Trump administration.

The news comes the day after Fervo announced that it had completed its hottest and deepest well to date. The company said it drilled down 15,765 feet in 16 days, and the temperature at the bottom of the well is expected to stabilize at around 520°F.

Drilling time represents a large share of geothermal power plant costs, which is why startups have been racing to see who can drill deeper and faster.

Fervo’s results have unlocked a new spigot of cash. The financing announced today includes $100 million in project-level preferred equity from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, the project finance arm of Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy group. Mercuria, which had previously provided a $120 million loan, provided another $60 million to that facility. And an X-Caliber Rural Capital affiliate contributed $45.6 million in bridge debt financing.

The startup has been on a fundraising tear lately. Fervo raised $244 million in February 2024 and another $255 million in December that was split between equity and debt. Energy secretary Chris Wright was at the helm of Liberty Energy when the company invested in Fervo in 2022.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/us-governments-vaccine-website-defaced-with-ai-generated-content/,"In Brief

A U.S. government website designed to inform the public about vaccines has been defaced and now hosts apparently AI-generated spam.

The domain, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), appears to have been hosting the same kind of content — mostly gay-themed and LGBTQ+ posts — since at least May 12, according to an archived version of the site.

It’s unclear who is responsible for it, or what is the purpose of this defacement other than pushing AI-generated slop spam. Websites hosted on official U.S. government domains have been hijacked in the past to host scam ads and hacking services.

On Wednesday, 404 Media reported that the vaccines HHS website is part of a wider spam operation that includes websites owned by NPR, Nvidia, and Stanford University, all of which redirect to “a nonsense SEO spam page,” as 404 Media journalist Sam Cole called it, hosted on wowlazy.com.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/at-wwdc-apple-says-it-will-use-ai-to-tag-apps-to-improve-discoverability-on-the-app-store/,"Apple will begin using AI technology to power the discovery of apps on the App Store, the company announced at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 25).

In a session focused on updates to App Store Connect, its app distribution platform for developers, the company announced it will introduce App Store Tags — labels that highlight specific features and functionalities found in an app.

These tags will initially be generated by Apple’s large language models using various sources, like the app’s metadata. They’ll then be human-reviewed before being applied to apps on the App Store.

Apple customers will be able to use these tags when searching for apps on the App Store, where the tags appear alongside the categories on the search page and the apps that appear in the search results.

Apple says the new tags will help surface information that’s often buried in app listings, like the app’s App Store description, category, metadata, or even in its screenshots. The tags, Apple believes, will help users more easily find the apps that offer the functionality they’re looking for, while also giving developers a better idea about how their apps are being discovered.

Today, consumers find apps through a number of App Store features, including its editorial pieces on the Today tab, collections curated by the App Store’s editorial team, by browsing app categories, or using App Store Search. Apple also monetizes the App Store with ads that can appear on the Today tab, the Search tab, on product pages, and in its search results.

When App Store users tap on one of the new tags, they’ll be taken to a new page offering a curated collection of all the apps and games that offer similar features or functionality — an extension to the App Store’s existing feature that points users to apps they “might also like,” found at the bottom of individual listings.

Although the tags themselves are AI-generated and reviewed, developers will ultimately have the final word on which tags are associated with their apps. A new information page will be available in the App Store Connect software, where they can manage tags or deselect those they don’t want to show up on their app’s product page.

Apple is already using AI on its App Store to summarize an app’s reviews by combining information into a short paragraph.

Tags aren’t the only improvements coming to the App Store. Apple says that developers will also be able to create custom product pages that appear when a user searches for apps using particular keywords. It’s also improving its app “nutrition labels” feature; expanding its lineup of app age ranges (there are now five); and extending offer codes to consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions.",Technology

Khaby Lame, currently the world’s top TikTok creator, was recently detained by U.S. immigration officials in Las Vegas and has since left the country, The New York Times reports. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Lame, an Italian Senegalese influencer known for his silent, deadpan reactions to viral clips, overstayed the terms of his visa after arriving in April. He was reportedly granted voluntary departure and is now abroad.

The situation grabbed headlines after a teenage influencer, Bo Loudon, boasted on X that he flagged Lame’s immigration status to authorities. Loudon, who often posts political content, said he reached out to contacts to report it.

Lame, 25, has built a massive global following — and a string of lucrative brand deals — after he reportedly lost his job during the pandemic.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openai-releases-o3-pro-a-souped-up-version-of-its-o3-ai-reasoning-model/,"OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an AI model that the company claims is its most capable yet.

O3-pro is a version of OpenAI’s o3, a reasoning model that the startup launched earlier this year. As opposed to conventional AI models, reasoning models work through problems step by step, enabling them to perform more reliably in domains like physics, math, and coding.

O3-pro is available for ChatGPT Pro and Team users starting Tuesday, replacing the o1-pro model. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after, OpenAI says. O3-pro is also live in OpenAI’s developer API as of this afternoon.

O3-pro is priced at $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API. Input tokens are tokens fed into the model, while output tokens are tokens that the model generates based on the input tokens.

A million input tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words, a bit longer than “War and Peace.”

OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.



Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.



As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.… — OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 10, 2025

“In expert evaluations, reviewers consistently prefer o3-pro over o3 in every tested category and especially in key domains like science, education, programming, business, and writing help,” OpenAI writes in a changelog. “Reviewers also rated o3-pro consistently higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy.”

O3-pro has access to tools, according to OpenAI, allowing it to search the web, analyze files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize its responses leveraging memory, and more. As a drawback, the model’s responses typically take longer than o1-pro to complete, according to OpenAI.

O3-pro has other limitations. Temporary chats with the model in ChatGPT are disabled for now while OpenAI resolves a “technical issue.” O3-pro can’t generate images. And Canvas, OpenAI’s AI-powered workspace feature, isn’t supported by o3-pro.

On the plus side, o3-pro achieves impressive scores in popular AI benchmarks, according to OpenAI’s internal testing. On AIME 2024, which evaluates a model’s math skills, o3-pro scores better than Google’s top-performing AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-everything-announced-including-liquid-glass-apple-intelligence-updates-and-more/,"WWDC 2025 kicked off Monday and as in previous years, the company focused on software updates and new technologies, including the next version of iOS, called iOS 26.

This year, there was considerable pressure on the company to build on its promises and to make amends to developers as it lags behind in AI and faces continued legal challenges over its App Store.

iOS 26 is the most dramatic design change in over a decade

When Apple introduced a major overhaul to iOS back in 2013 with the launch of iOS 7, it felt jarring for many users with the shift from the prior skeuomorphic design with gradients and real-world textures to the more colorful, but flat, design style that reflected Apple’s then chief design officer Jony Ive’s taste for minimalism.

At WWDC 2025, the company announced a refreshed user interface called Liquid Glass, which features shiny, reflective, and transparent visual interface elements that give the software a more “glassy” look and feel.

The Liquid Glass display is translucent and will behave like glass in the real world. The color of the screen is informed by your content and will adapt between light and dark environments. In addition, alerts appear from where you tap, context menus expand into a scannable list when you scroll and tap.

The Lock Screen and Home Screen are getting updates that align with the overall aesthetic of Liquid Glass.

iOS 26, a new naming scheme

Instead of using system names like iOS 19 and macOS 19, Apple will now use the year as part of the name. This means all its operating systems will be called iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26.

A dedicated Games app

Apple unveiled a new dedicated gaming app that is designed to centralize gaming experiences on Apple devices. The app will serve as a launcher for games and allow users to track achievements and view leaderboards.

The Games app will also include social features, including a “Play Together” tab that lets you see what your friends are playing, compare scores, and invite them to play with you. There’s also “Challenges,” which is a new way to compete with friends in score-based showdowns.

Apple showed off watchOS 26, the upcoming software overhaul for the Apple Watch. It will launch with a redesigned interface based on Apple’s new Liquid Glass operating system, a wrist-flick gesture, a new Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy fitness feature, and more.

Apple TV is also getting a redesign, featuring a Liquid Glass aesthetic that offers a sleek and “unobtrusive” design, the company said. One of the standout features is the ability to quickly jump into a user profile. Apple TV will now present profile options each time it wakes from sleep, making it more convenient for each family member to select their profile and quickly resume watching their own favorite shows and movies. There’s also a karaoke feature.

macOS 26, which the company calls Tahoe, is getting some upgrades as well, in addition to the new Liquid Glass aesthetic will include an AI-powered Shortcuts app.

iPad OS will make the iPad feel like a Mac, including a new Preview feature that gives users a range of tools, including markup using Apple Pencil and AutoFill. Users can also export images in different formats.

And along with updates to visionOS, Apple’s Vision Pro AR/VR headset is getting a couple of new accessories: a Logitech Muse stylus and PlayStation’s VR2 Sense controller compatibility.

While leaks suggested more gestures and other additions, Apple announced that the AirPods lineup would be getting two key features: studio-quality audio recording and camera remote. It’s also getting a camera remote.

Three of the biggest additions to CarPlay will be widgets and live activities, as well as the ability to choose a “tapback” response to incoming messages. Users will now also be able to pin their favorite conversations, just like in iMessage.

Apple Wallet, polls, Maps, and more

Other smaller features were announced as well, like new travel-friendly features for Apple Wallet; polls in iMessages; lyrics translation and pronunciation features; and Maps will learn your commute.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/apple-redesigns-its-operating-systems-with-liquid-glass/,"Apple’s iPhone may not be getting a significant AI upgrade, but it is getting a fresh coat of paint. As are Apple’s other operating systems.

At WWDC 2025, the company announced a refreshed user interface called Liquid Glass, which features shiny, reflective, and transparent visual interface elements that give the software a more “glassy” look and feel.

Image Credits:Apple (screenshot)

The design refresh is inspired by Apple’s VR headset, the Vision Pro. It unifies the iPhone’s design and that of Apple’s other devices, with the interface built for the spatial computing headset. This change could also hint at a potential future that could see Apple’s operating system and software extended to other surfaces besides phones, tablets, and watches — like AR glasses, perhaps.

Introduced at WWDC by Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of design, the Liquid Glass interface represents the biggest visual update to iOS, the software powering the iPhone, since the move from the original skeumorphic design to a flat design style in iOS 7.

Image Credits:Apple (screenshot)

With skeumorphism, the idea was to translate real-world objects to the touch screen — like a Notes app that looked like a yellow legal pad. Flat design upended this visual language, opting instead for simple shapes, clean lines, a minimalist user interface, and more colorful icons.

Over time, iOS’s flat design evolved to have more glossy and semi-translucent layers, like a Control Center that mimicked a frosted pane of glass.

Image Credits:Apple (screenshot)

As Dye explained, the Liquid Glass redesign includes the “optical qualities of glass and a fluidity that only Apple can achieve.”

The company says the update will bring more clarity to navigation and controls, refracts light, and dynamically reacts to your movement. In addition, it will respond in real time to your content and your input, creating a “more lively experience,” Dye said.

The Liquid Glass display is translucent and will behave like glass in the real world. The color of the screen is informed by your content and will adapt between light and dark environments. In addition, alerts appear from where you tap, context menus expand into a scannable list when you scroll and tap.

The design applies to both the system experiences, like the Lock Screen, Notifications, and Control Center, as well as the app icons.

The company says the new icons will look like they’ve been crafted with multiple layers of liquid glass and will come in light mode, dark mode, and a new clear mode.

On the Lock Screen, the time will appear in a glassy San Francisco typeface and will dynamically adapt its weight, width, and height depending on the image on the screen. Plus, the iPhone can change your 2D photos into spatial scenes with 3D effects, which pairs nicely with the glass-like user interface.

When streaming from Apple Music, the player controls are also designed with Liquid Glass and show new animations provided by artists that enhance the playing experience — a feature Spotify offers today with its looping videos.

Liquid Glass can be found in other elements, like FaceTime and Safari tab bar and their various controls.

Liquid Glass isn’t only built for the iPhone’s iOS 26. It’s coming to all of Apple’s operating systems, including iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26.

Developers will also be able to build apps using new Liquid Glass materials via SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit, and new APIs.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/major-us-grocery-distributor-warns-of-disruption-after-cyberattack/,"United Natural Foods (UNFI), a major distributor of groceries to Whole Foods and other retailers, said on Monday that it was hit by a cyberattack, warning of disruptions to its ability to fulfill and distribute customer orders.

UNFI said in a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it became aware of unauthorized access to its IT systems last Thursday, and began shutting down portions of its network. The filing added that the company has “implemented workarounds for certain operations in order to continue servicing its customers where possible,” but noted that the intrusion has caused ongoing disruptions to its business operations.

The Providence, Rhode Island-based company is one of the largest grocery distributors in North America, selling fresh produce, goods, and food products to more than 30,000 stores and supermarket locations across the U.S. and Canada.

UNFI also serves as the “primary distributor” to Whole Foods, the Amazon-owned grocery chain. Last year, the two companies extended their long-running contract until May 2032.

When reached by TechCrunch, UNFI spokesperson Kristen Jimenez would not describe the nature of the cyberattack or say if the intruder had demanded a ransom from the company.

“We are assessing the unauthorized activity and working to restore our systems to safely bring them back online,” said Jimenez, adding that the incident was reported to law enforcement.

A spokesperson for Whole Foods did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.

The incident at UNFI is the latest in a string of cyberattacks affecting the wider retail and grocery supply chain in recent months. Following the data breaches at U.K. retail giants Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, Google warned that hackers were also targeting U.S. retailers, though it did not name the affected companies.

When asked, UNFI did not say when it expects to recover its systems.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/anthropics-ai-generated-blog-dies-an-early-death/,"Claude’s blog is no more.

A week after TechCrunch profiled Anthropic’s experiment to task the company’s Claude AI models with writing blog posts, Anthropic wound down the blog and redirected the address to its homepage. Sometime over the weekend, the Claude Explains blog disappeared — along with its initial few posts.

A source familiar tells TechCrunch the blog was a “pilot” meant to help Anthropic’s team combine customer requests for explainer-type “tips and tricks” content with marketing goals.

Claude Explains, which had a dedicated page on Anthropic’s website and was edited for accuracy by humans, was populated by posts on technical topics related to various Claude use cases (e.g. “Simplify complex codebases with Claude”). The blog, which was intended to be a showcase of sorts for Claude’s writing abilities, wasn’t clear about how much of Claude’s raw writing was making its way into each post.

An Anthropic spokesperson previously told TechCrunch that the blog was overseen by “subject matter experts and editorial teams” who “enhance[d]” Claude’s drafts with “insights, practical examples, and […] contextual knowledge.” The spokesperson also said Claude Explains would expand to topics ranging from creative writing to data analysis to business strategy.

Apparently, those plans changed in pretty short order.

“[Claude Explains is a] demonstration of how human expertise and AI capabilities can work together,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch earlier this month. “[The blog] is an early example of how teams can use AI to augment their work and provide greater value to their users. Rather than replacing human expertise, we’re showing how AI can amplify what subject matter experts can accomplish.”

Claude Explains didn’t get the rosiest reception on social media, in part due to the lack of transparency about which copy was AI-generated. Some users pointed out it looked a lot like an attempt to automate content marketing, an ad tactic that relies on generating content on popular topics to serve as a funnel for potential customers.

More than 24 websites were linking to Claude Explains posts before Anthropic wound down the pilot, according to search engine optimization tool Ahrefs. That’s not bad for a blog that was only live for around a month.

Anthropic might’ve also grown wary of implying Claude performs better at writing tasks than is actually the case. Even the best AI today is prone to confidently making things up, which has led to embarrassing gaffes on the part of publishers that have publicly embraced the tech. For example, Bloomberg has had to correct dozens of AI-generated summaries of its articles, and G/O Media’s error-riddled AI-written features — published against editors’ wishes — attracted widespread ridicule.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/07/superblocks-ceo-how-to-find-a-unicorn-idea-by-studying-ai-system-prompts/,"Brad Menezes, CEO of enterprise vibe-coding startup Superblocks, believes the next crop of billion-dollar startup ideas is hiding in almost plain sight: the system prompts used by existing unicorn AI startups.

System prompts are the lengthy prompts — over 5,000 to 6,000 words — that AI startups use to instruct the foundational models from companies like OpenAI or Anthropic on how to generate their application-level AI products. They are, in Menezes’ view, like a master class in prompt engineering.

“Every single company has a completely different system prompt for the same [foundational] model,” he told TechCrunch. “They’re trying to get the model to do exactly what’s required for a specific domain, specific tasks.”

System prompts aren’t exactly hidden. Customers can ask many AI tools to share theirs. But they aren’t always publicly available.

So as part of his own startup’s new product announcement of an enterprise coding AI agent named Clark, Superblocks offered to share a file of 19 system prompts from some of the most popular AI coding products like Windsurf, Manus, Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt.

Menezes’ tweet went viral, viewed by almost 2 million people, including big names in the Valley like Sam Blond, formerly of Founders Fund and Brex, and Aaron Levie, a Superblocks investor. Superblocks announced last week that it raised a $23 million Series A extension round, bringing its total Series A to $60 million for its vibe-coding tools geared toward non-developers at enterprises.

So we asked Menezes to walk us through how to study other’s system prompts to glean insights.

“I’d say the biggest learning for us building Clark and reading through the system prompts is that the system prompt itself is maybe 20% of the secret sauce,” he explained. This prompt gives the LLM the baseline of what to do.

The other 80% is “prompt enrichment” he said, which is the infrastructure a startup builds around the calls to the LLM. That part includes instructions it attaches to a user’s prompt, and actions taken when returning the response, such as checking for accuracy.

He said there are three parts of system prompts to study: role prompting, contextual prompting, and tool use.

The first thing to notice is that, while system prompts are written in natural language, they are exceptionally specific. “You basically have to speak as if you would to a human co-worker,” Menezes said. “And the instructions have to be perfect.”

Role prompting helps the LLMs be consistent, giving both purpose and personality. For instance, Devin’s begins with, “You are Devin, a software engineer using a real computer operating system. You are a real code-wiz: few programmers are as talented as you at understanding codebases, writing functional and clean code, and iterating on your changes until they are correct.”

Contextual prompting gives the models the context to consider before acting. It should provide guardrails that can, for instance, reduce costs and ensure clarity on tasks.

Cursor’s instructs, “Only call tools when needed, and never mention tool names to the user — just describe what you’re doing. … Don’t show code unless asked. … Read relevant file content before editing and fix clear errors, but don’t guess or loop fixes more than three times.”

Tool use enables agentic tasks because it instructs the models how to go beyond just generating text. Replit’s, for instance, is long and describes editing and searching code, installing languages, setting up and querying PostgreSQL databases, executing shell commands, and more.

Studying others’ system prompts helped Menezes see what other vibe coders emphasized. Tools like Loveable, V0, and Bolt “focus on fast iteration,” he said, whereas “Manus, Devin, OpenAI Codex, and Replit” help users create full-stack applications but “the output is still raw code.”

Menezes saw an opportunity to let non-programmers write apps, if his startup could handle more, such as security and access to enterprise data sources like Salesforce.

While Menezes is not yet running the multibillion-dollar startup of his dreams, Superblocks has landed some notable companies as customers, including Instacart and Papaya Global.

Menezes is also dogfooding the product internally. His software engineers are not allowed to write internal tools; they can only build the product. So his business folks have built agents for all their needs, like one that uses CRM data to identify leads, one that tracks support metrics, another that balances the assignments of the human sales engineers.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/jony-ives-lovefrom-helped-design-rivians-first-electric-bike/,"LoveFrom, the creative firm founded by former Apple chief designer Jony Ive, played a role in the development of Rivian’s first electric bike, according to multiple sources who spoke to TechCrunch.

For about 18 months, a handful of LoveFrom staff worked alongside Rivian’s design team and engineers within a skunkworks program led by Specialized’s former chief product and technology officer Chris Yu. LoveFrom’s work on the micromobility project ended in fall 2024, according to the sources.

LoveFrom and Rivian declined to comment.

Rivian’s skunkworks program, which eventually grew to a team of about 70 people hailing from Apple, Google, Specialized, Tesla, and REI Co-Op, spun out earlier this year with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures.

The micromobility startup, called Also, has yet to show off its first vehicle designs. In interviews with TechCrunch, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe (who is on Also’s board) and Yu were cagey about what the new company’s first vehicle would look like.

“There’s a seat, and there’s two wheels, there’s a screen, and there’s a few computers and a battery,” Scaringe said in March. He has also said it will be “bike-like,” a description confirmed by sources.

But both Scaringe and Yu spoke of a much bigger vision for Also, one where it could theoretically tackle almost any imaginable micromobility form factor. The new company is supposed to reveal its first designs at an event later this year. An Also spokesperson declined to comment about its bike or any connection to LoveFrom.

When the electric “bike” is revealed, it’s possible that Ive’s fingerprints will be all over it.

Ive is best known for being the design force behind the iPhone and myriad other Apple products, and most recently, for his work with Sam Altman and OpenAI. But his collaboration with Rivian is not his first foray into the transportation industry.

The parent company of Ferrari announced in 2021 that Ive’s firm would help develop the Italian supercar manufacturer’s next-generation vehicles. Ive was also involved with Apple’s secretive car project. He was reportedly one of the main proponents for centering Apple’s long-running car project around autonomy, whereas other people inside the company pushed for a more traditional electric car. Apple abandoned that project early last year.

Sources told TechCrunch that Ive’s LoveFrom has acted as a consultant for Rivian in the past, including on the company’s redesigned infotainment system and retail, among other areas, according to two former employees with knowledge of the relationship. But its involvement in what would become Also was a more structured and dedicated effort, another source familiar with the relationship said.

The skunkworks program began taking shape in early 2022 with a directive to explore whether Rivian’s EV technology could be condensed down into something smaller and more affordable than its electric vans, trucks, and SUVs.

Initially, the small team worked with Rivian designers to develop a product that could scale to different types of vehicles. A key design challenge was how to make the bike-like product modular while still maintaining the elevated aesthetics Rivian has become known for.

By the time LoveFrom got involved in the project in early 2023, a lot of work had been completed, according to sources who said they helped refine the prototypes.

The relationship was described as a “pretty tight” collaboration between the skunkworks team, LoveFrom’s staff, and the industrial designers based out of Rivian’s headquarters in Irvine. This group looked at everything, including the user interface and UX for the bike.

The industrial design team at LoveFrom, which has a lot of experience with thoughtful and clever packaging, was particularly involved, according to one source, who noted the team brought an interdisciplinary and international perspective to the project.",Technology

The company says Shortcuts can now tap into Apple Intelligence directly, and developers will be able to access Apple’s on-device large language model (LLM).

With Shortcuts, users will be able to access the AI models either on device or with Private Compute to generate responses that feed into the rest of their shortcut. For instance, a student could create a shortcut that uses AI to compare their audio transcription of their class lecture to their notes, then add key points they missed. They can also tap into ChatGPT to provide further responses that feed into their shortcut’s input.

Users will be able to tap into intelligent actions, which are a new type of shortcut that’s enabled by Apple Intelligence. For instance, there are dedicated actions like those for summarizing text with AI (Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools) or creating images with Image Playground.

During his SXSW keynote on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows.

In an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night.

“I just go on ChatGPT or whatever,” Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter.

He then added that “you learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,” and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. “I want them to join in. I want them to sing along.”

The interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band’s songs, among other things.

At one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it’s presented.

“Songs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they’re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn’t put more stuff in there,” he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.” (He said he didn’t think this was a great idea, for what it’s worth, adding that “after six or seven songs, put it on the next record!”)

Today, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there’s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily.

CCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was “magical and remarkable.”

“If your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that’s their media: streaming,” he said.",Entertainment

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/,"Commercial nuclear fusion power isn’t a reality yet. But venture capital is flowing into startups that promise that clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy is no longer just a distant dream.

Most fusion companies that have raised over $100 million are based in the United States. Not Proxima Fusion, a German startup that has just secured a €130 million Series A round of funding (approximately $148 million) led by Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

This brings Proxima’s public and private funding to over €185 million ($200 million), increasing its chances to be one of Europe’s top contenders in the race for an alternative to fission, one which does not depend on uranium or other imported fissile materials used in current nuclear reactors.

The pursuit isn’t solely for scientific prestige; it is deeply intertwined with energy security. “Wait for the early 2030s and you will see fusion giants in each geopolitical block,” Proxima’s CEO and co-founder Francesco Sciortino predicted in an interview with TechCrunch.

Until now, Proxima didn’t have the means to become such a giant; its April 2024 seed round was only €20 million ($21.7 million). Since then Proxima published its plans for a working fusion power plant in a peer-reviewed journal.

The paper made the case for stellarators, a type of reactor that uses magnetic fields to confine hot plasma into a ring long enough for fusion to occur. Unlike their main alternative, tokamaks, stellarators’ twisted rings don’t require a plasma current, making them more stable. Building upon its proximity to the world’s largest stellarator, Germany’s Wendelstein 7-X, Proxima came up with its own Stellaris design, a significant milestone detailed in the paper.

The hefty new funding was partly a reflection of reaching this milestone in half the time it had originally told investors, Sciortino said. With an oversubscribed round, the company had its pick. “Now we have the right kind of partners not just for this stage, but to finance us in the next stage.”

Both funds that co-led the round could follow on. Balderton raised $1.3 billion in 2024 for its Early Stage Fund IX and its Growth Fund II. As for Cherry, it closed its latest fund at $500 million in February 2025, to be split between early-stage and follow-ons at Series B and beyond.

Sciortino estimates that it will need venture capital as an investment category “to bring [Proxima] to 2031, give or take.” After that point, the company expects to seek other forms of capital. But before then, it will need the capital to meet big milestones, including a critical hardware demonstration scheduled for 2027. In his view, the funding was made possible by the understanding “that this is not an infinitely long journey for our current investors.”

By the rules of venture capital, investors may be less convinced that fusion will happen on that timeline, but they are willing to bet. Ian Hogarth, a partner at founders-led fund Plural, has now invested in Proxima three times, and calls it a “big shot.”

A nuclear fusion future is particularly appealing for the Old Continent. “Proxima represents an opportunity to decarbonize and provide a stable baseload for all the downstream energy needs the world has, and for Europe to play a global leadership role in driving the energy transition,” Hogarth told TechCrunch.

Proxima’s cap table is once again very European, with participants in the round including Bayern Kapital, Club degli Investitori, DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF), Elaia, HTGF, Leitmotif, Lightspeed, OMNES Capital, and UVC Partners.

“We consider Proxima to be thoroughly European and not just German,” Sciortino said. Proxima has its headquarters and lab in Munich, where it spun off from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP). But it also has teams at Switzerland’s Paul Scherrer Institute and at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the U.K.’s national laboratory for fusion research near Oxford.

Sciortino himself, a physicist by background, is originally from Italy, but worked on fusion research in the U.K., Switzerland, and then at MIT in the U.S. There were several reasons for him to move back to Europe, but one of them speaks to a sentiment echoed by investors: “I’m a fairly proud European, and always wanted to think that there is a future on this continent that somebody has to build.”",Science

Earlier this year, the 9-year-old company was seeking a valuation of around $25 billion, according to a person familiar with the deal. Should it achieve that, it would be a massive jump from its $9 billion Series E valuation secured in December 2023.

The deal was not finalized, and terms — including its valuation — could change, this person said, adding that the requested valuation was high at the time, despite impressive growth. Many VCs are interested in and watching Vast, other sources tell TechCrunch.

Vast didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Vast Data offers data management software coupled with unified CPU, GPU, and data hardware from vendors like Supermicro, HPE, and Cisco. Whereas old-school data storage options rely on tiers (low-cost storage options for long-term storage, higher-end options for more frequently used data), Vast aims to eliminate such tiers. It is particularly aimed at flash storage.

AI has been a boon to Vast’s business. The company’s platform stores structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one place, which accelerates data retrieval and, it says, reduces the cost of model training and inference.

The company’s customers include large enterprises such as Pixar, ServiceNow, and xAI, as well as next-generation AI cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda, which use Vast’s technology to offer storage capabilities to their end users.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-how-to-delete-your-data/,"DNA testing service 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March, sparking concerns about what could happen to the genetic data of the company’s 15 million customers.

Pharmaceutical giant Regeneron announced in May that it was buying the genetic testing company for $256 million following a bankruptcy auction. While the company has said it will maintain 23andMe’s privacy practices, it also stated that it would use the 23andMe data to aid the discovery of new drugs.

When 23andMe filed for bankruptcy, security experts and lawmakers cautioned customers to take action to protect their data. This week, 23andMe’s interim chief executive Joseph Selsavage told lawmakers that 1.9 million people, or about 15% of its customer base, have requested to delete their genetic data. Selsavage shared the number during a House Oversight Committee hearing where lawmakers scrutinized the company’s sale.

Also this week, more than two dozen states sued 23andMe to challenge the sale of its customers’ private data. The states argue the company must obtain explicit consent from its customers before selling their data.

If you’re one of the 15 million people who shared their DNA with 23andMe, we’ve outlined the steps you can take to protect yourself. While you can’t delete all your 23andMe data, there are some things you can control.

How to delete your 23andMe data

To delete your data from 23andMe, you need to log in to your account and then follow these steps:

Navigate to the Settings section of your profile.

section of your profile. Scroll down to the selection labeled 23andMe Data .

. Click the View option and scroll to the Delete Data section.

option and scroll to the section. Select the Permanently Delete Data button.

You will then receive an email from 23andMe with a link that will allow you to confirm your deletion request.

You can choose to download a copy of your data before deleting it.

There is an important caveat, as 23andMe’s privacy policy states that the company and its labs “will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations.”

The policy continues: “23andMe will also retain limited information related to your account and data deletion request, including but not limited to, your email address, account deletion request identifier, communications related to inquiries or complaints and legal agreements for a limited period of time as required by law, contractual obligations, and/or as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and for audit and compliance purposes.”

This essentially means that 23andMe may keep some of your information for an unspecified amount of time.

How to destroy your 23andMe test sample and revoke permission for your data to be used for research

If you previously opted to have your saliva sample and DNA stored by 23andMe, you can change this setting.

To revoke your permission, go into your 23andMe account settings page and then navigate to Preferences.

In addition, if you previously agreed to 23andMe and third-party researchers using your genetic data and sample for research, you can withdraw consent from the Research and Product Consents section in your account settings.

While you can reverse that consent, there’s no way for you to delete that information.

Check in with your family members

Once you have requested the deletion of your data, it’s important to check in with your family members and encourage them to do the same because it’s not just their DNA that’s at risk of sale — it also affects people they are related to.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/ongoing-cyberattack-at-us-grocery-distributor-giant-unfi-affecting-customer-orders/,"U.S. grocery distribution giant United Natural Foods (UNFI) said on Tuesday it is working to restore its capabilities following a cyberattack last week that continues to disrupt the grocery supply chain.

UNFI said as part of its third-quarter earnings report that it was “diligently managing through the cyber incident” it confirmed on Monday. The company is “helping our customers with short-term solutions wherever possible,” said UNFI chief executive Sandy Douglas in prepared remarks.

On the company’s post-results conference call, Douglas said UNFI is “continuing to safely bring our systems back online and restore broad-based customer service as soon as possible.”

The company, which is the primary distributor for Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and supplies over 250,000 grocery store products, including frozen goods, disclosed on Monday that it had identified unauthorized access to its IT systems. Douglas said on its call Tuesday that the company has since shut down its entire network.

The company has not described the nature of the cyberattack, but it said the intrusion was causing ongoing disruptions to its operations, including its ability to fulfill and distribute customer orders.

Douglas told investors on the call that the company was shipping to customers “on a limited basis.”

One customer of UNFI told TechCrunch that they are trialing a new product in Whole Foods stores this week, but said much of their supply had not been delivered. The customer said they have heard nothing from either UNFI or Whole Foods about the disruption.

TechCrunch has heard anecdotal reports of diminished or empty shelves at some stores affected by the disruption at UNFI, but it is not immediately clear if this is due to the cyberattack or other supply chain issues. Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week.

Whole Foods has not returned a request for comment from TechCrunch. Reuters cited a Whole Foods spokesperson as saying that the retail giant was “working to restock our shelves as quickly as possible” and referred additional questions back to UNFI.

It’s not clear how much UNFI has spent on cybersecurity, nor who is ultimately responsible for cybersecurity at the company.

A spokesperson for UNFI did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Tuesday.

Much of the UNFI’s external-facing systems are offline, including web systems used by suppliers and customers, as well as the company’s VPN products, according to checks by TechCrunch.

UNFI reported $8.1 billion in net sales in the quarter ended May 3, 2025. The company said it was expecting to report a loss on net income and earnings per share for its 2025 outlook following the ending of a contract with a grocery store chain’s operations in the U.S. northeast, but that it is not adjusting its outlook at this time due to the “ongoing assessment” of the cyberattack.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/jewel-burks-solomons-collab-capital-has-closed-a-new-75m-fund/,"Collab Capital announced today the close of a $75 million Fund II.

Jewel Burks Solomon, who rose to prominence in Silicon Valley during her years running Google for Startups US, has just closed her second fund for her VC firm Collab Capital.

Fund II is $75 million and includes heavyweight limited partners like Apple, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and The Leon Levine Foundation.

Solomon co-founded the firm alongside Barry Givens in 2020 with an inaugural $50 million Fund I and invested in 38 companies, including the waste management platform Goodr and Culina Health.

Fund II will continue to back early-stage companies — seed and Series A — building in the future of work, healthcare, and infrastructure.

She said this latest fund will let Collab Capital “double down” on its mission of supporting promising founders tackling big, systemic problems.”

“What’s next is deeper conviction, bigger bets, and continued proof that shared prosperity is scalable and can generate competitive returns,” Solomon told TechCrunch.

The Fund will cut checks ranging between $1 and $2 million to at least 30 companies across the next five years. It has already invested in six companies, while 40% of the fund is reserved for follow-on investments.

Solomon said raising this second fund was incredibly hard and it took her and her team nearly two years.

”We were navigating a tough macro climate and shifting LP priorities,” she said. “But we stayed committed to our vision and built strong relationships with LPs who see both the urgency and the opportunity in what we’re doing.”

The announcement of Collab Capital’s Fund II comes as Black-led and founded funds continue closing sizable funds. Just last month, Zeal Capital Partners announced the close of an $82 million Fund II. Earlier this year, Sydney Thomas’ Symphonic Capital raised a $13.5 million inaugural fund, while Cherryrock Capital, founded by Stacy Brown-Philpot, announced a $172 million Fund I. Late last year, Slauson & Co. announced a $100 million Fund II.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/an-investor-makes-a-case-for-funding-sex-drugs-and-other-socially-taboo-products/,"Impact investor and advisor Christian Tooley posed a simple question to the audience at SXSW London last week: What if investors found a way to embrace human contradiction to contribute to change that goes beyond the returns so keenly sought for in venture capital?

Tooley was mainly referring to vice clauses, the restrictions that limited partners place on venture firms to guardrail their investments. But he also spoke about investing in overall systems, or the structures of everyday life, from biology to social.

Some of these no-no sectors often include products dealing with sex, substances like psychedelics, gambling, and tobacco, and such limitations are usually imposed by large institutional investors, who don’t want to invest in products that are at best controversial and at worst potentially harmful.

Tooley feels investors are missing out on innovation by keeping away from these so-called vices, especially where sex and substances are concerned. “Returns can be financial, cultural, and systemic,” Tooley told the crowd. “Sex is high-volume, consumer-facing, with lower upfront capital needs. Substances have moderate-to-long ROI but higher payoffs.”

He argued that such clauses are really more about bowing to the social stigma around these topics, even though some startups could be bringing about positive health and social benefits, in addition to being lucrative.

The sex tech market, for example, is expected to hit nearly $200 billion by 2032, he said. Over the years, the industry has received small but steady amounts of venture capital funding, a few hundred million at best. Specialized investors and firms, notably Vice Ventures, have sought to back more companies, but there hasn’t been an onrush, especially from mainstream investors, to follow its lead.

Even OnlyFans, despite earning billions in revenue, struggled to find investors because of its association with pornographic content. “Entire industries are underfunded not because they lack merit, but because they challenge comfort,” Tooley later told TechCrunch.

As an investor, Tooley has backed products such as Polari Labs, a tool that promises to improve anal sex, and linq, a company touting to provide a safer way to send nudes.

It’s not surprising that large institutional investors steer away from such categories, as many of them are endowments and pension funds looking to avoid legal uncertainty and reputational harm. Some investors who passed on OnlyFans were worried about minors possibly being on the platform.

Regarding substances, cannabis is a good example, because it is only legal on a state-by-state basis. There are legal, regulatory, and tax uncertainties that could come with backing what is, in most cases, a criminalized product.

With less competition from institutional funds, Tooley says vice investing can be a particularly good opportunity for smaller LPs, family offices, and progressive funds. “If you only focus on the perceived controversy, you miss the innovation and often, the returns, too,” he added.

Tooley said it is important to address the stigma around investing in areas that may be beneficial but are currently shunned. Tooley, for example, noted that it was considered controversial to talk openly about matters like menstruation.

Today, we have venture-backed companies like unicorn period tracker Flo, femble, and WomanLog.

Tooley imagines a world where more investors back taboo companies leading to better sexual health tools, psychedelic therapies with more cultural nuance, and biohacking relevant to queer and trans bodies. “We don’t just need funders comfortable with risk,” he said. “We need ones deeply uncomfortable with the status quo.”

Meta is discussing a multibillion-dollar investment in Scale AI, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the deal value could reportedly exceed $10 billion, making it the largest external AI investment by Facebook’s parent company and one of the largest funding events ever for a private company.

Scale AI (whose CEO Alexandr Wang is pictured above) provides data labeling services to companies such as Microsoft and OpenAI to help them train their AI models. Much of that labeling work is done by contractors — in fact, the Department of Labor recently dropped its investigation into whether the company was misclassifying and underpaying employees.

According to Bloomberg, the company saw $870 million in revenue last year and expects to bring in $2 billion this year.

Meta was already an investor in Scale AI’s $1 billion Series F, which valued the company at $13.8 billion. Scale AI also built Defense Llama, a large language model designed for military use, on top of Meta’s Llama 3.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/why-investing-in-growth-stage-ai-startups-is-getting-riskier-and-more-complicated/,"Making a bet on AI startups has never been so exciting — or more risky. Incumbents like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are scaling their capabilities fast to swallow many of the offerings of smaller companies. At the same time, new startups are reaching the growth stage much faster than they historically have.

But defining “growth stage” in AI startups is not so cut-and-dried today.

Jill Chase, partner at CapitalG, said onstage at TechCrunch Sessions: AI on Thursday that she’s seeing more companies that are only a year old, yet have already reached tens of millions in annual recurring revenue and more than $1 billion in valuation. While those companies might be defined as mature due to their valuation and revenue generation, they often lack much of the necessary safety, hiring, and executive infrastructure.

“On one hand, that’s really exciting. It represents this brand-new trend of extremely fast growth, which is awesome,” Chase said. “On the other hand, it’s a little bit scary because I’m gonna pay at an $X billion valuation for this company that didn’t exist 12 months ago, and things are changing so quickly.”

“Who knows who is in a garage somewhere, maybe in this audience somewhere, starting a company that in 12 months will be a lot better than this one I’m investing in that’s at $50 million ARR today,” Chase continued. “So it’s made growth investing a little confusing.”

To cut through the noise, Chase said it’s important for investors to feel good about the category and the “ability of the founder to very quickly adapt and see around corners.”

She noted that AI coding startup Cursor is a great example of a company that “jumped on the exact right use case of AI code generation that was available and possible given the technology at the time.”

However, Cursor will need to work to maintain its edge.

“There will be, by the end of this year, AI software engineers,” Chase said. “In that scenario, what Cursor has today is going to be a little less relevant. It is incumbent on the Cursor team to see that future and to think, okay, how do I start building my product so that when those models come out and are much more powerful, the product surface represents those and I can very quickly plug those in and switch into that state of code generation?”",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/meta-ai-gains-video-editing-capabilities/,"Meta said Wednesday that it is adding video editing capabilities to Meta AI that let users edit short videos using preset AI prompts to change costumes, locations, and styles. With these new features, the company is taking on rivals like Google that have been steadily adding generative AI video tools to their apps, as well as other AI-powered editing platforms like Captions.

The company is rolling out the editing tools to the Meta AI app, Meta.ai website, and its CapCut competitor, Edits, in the U.S. It says that the features were inspired by its Movie Gen AI models, but it’s not clear if the company is using those models to power the editing tools.

For now, users will have to deal with 50 presets to edit a 10-second video. Meta said that it gathered feedback from creators to make these presets so they can be easily included in the Edits app.

The presets can apply a “vintage comic book style” to a video, change the lighting in a clip to a rainy day, or swap out a subject’s clothing to a space cadet suit, to give a few examples. You can share edited videos directly to Facebook and Instagram from the Edits and Meta AI app.

Meta said it plans to add more customization options later this year.

“We built this … so that everyone can experiment creatively and make fun, interesting videos to share with their friends, family, and followers,” the company said in its blog post. “Whether you’re reimagining a favorite family memory or finding new ways to entertain your audience, our video editing [tools] can help.”

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/musk-targets-june-22-launch-of-teslas-long-promised-robotaxi-service/,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his company will start offering public rides in driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, on June 22, which would mark the beginning of his long-promised robotaxi service.

That date could shift because Musk claimed Tesla is “being super paranoid about safety.” Tesla Model Y SUVs have been spotted in recent days and weeks being tested around Austin with no drivers in the seat. Bloomberg News previously reported that Tesla was eyeing a June 12 launch of the service.

Musk has spent years claiming Teslas would be able to drive themselves. In 2019, he claimed Tesla would launch a robotaxi service in 2020 that would feature 1 million driverless vehicles. That never happened.

Instead, Tesla has spent the intervening years iterating on the software it calls Full Self-Driving (FSD), which requires drivers to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time. That software is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after it was allegedly involved in multiple crashes during low-visibility conditions, including one where a pedestrian was killed.

Musk has claimed Tesla has developed FSD to such a point that it will no longer need to be supervised. This new “unsupervised” version of Tesla’s FSD software is what’s powering the vehicles in Austin. And Musk claimed Tuesday that “every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised driving.”

Those claims come with caveats, though. The small fleet of vehicles — around 10 to start, according to Musk — will be geofenced to the “safest” areas of Austin, according to Musk. Teslas have also been spotted repeatedly running through one particular neighborhood in Southeast Austin, presumably gathering data to create a smoother experience.

That’s a big change in approach from how Musk spent years talking about FSD being a general-purpose self-driving solution that would work in any location without human supervision. Tesla’s process now more closely resembles how Waymo — which currently operates a commercial robotaxi business in multiple U.S. cities — rolls out its service in new locations.

Also, Musk’s claim about new Teslas being able to perform unsupervised driving represents a major change from his promise in 2016 that all of the company’s cars had the hardware required to become fully self-driving. That was not true. Tesla has gone through multiple versions of FSD hardware on its vehicles in the years since, and Musk admitted in January that millions of those cars would need an upgrade to run the current software. It’s unclear whether that kind of upgrade is even possible.",Automobile
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/wayve-and-uber-plan-london-robotaxi-launch-after-uk-speeds-up-autonomous-vehicle-rollout/,"U.K.-based autonomous vehicle technology company Wayve and Uber plan to launch a fully driverless robotaxi service in London in the coming years.

The news comes soon after the U.K.’s announcement of an accelerated framework for self-driving commercial pilots. U.K. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed Tuesday that the U.K. government would fast-track pilots to spring 2026, up from late 2027, to incentivize investment in autonomy in the country.

Wayve and Uber did not share many details of their upcoming launch, such as when exactly the companies would begin trials and service, with how many vehicles, or via which vehicle manufacturer partner or partners. Wayve said in April that its tech would be headed to Nissan vehicles.

The announcement follows Uber’s strategic investment into Wayve in 2024 that promised to see the startup’s AI integrated into consumer vehicles that will one day operate on Uber’s platform.

A Wayve spokesperson told TechCrunch the companies would start in the U.K. capital and scale out to greater London and beyond from there. First, every company involved in launching a robotaxi service would need to prove relevant safety cases to regulators.

“We have a partner ecosystem for bringing a service to market,” Sarah Gates, Wayve’s director of public policy, told TechCrunch. “Wayve provides driving intelligence integrated into a base vehicle provided by a vehicle manufacturer, and then we would have a fleet operator, and Uber would operate the service. So each part of that supply chain would need to prove safety and responsible deployment for what they’re responsible for.”

In Wayve’s case, the company needs to prove the safety of the system and how it drives within its operational design domain. Uber would have separate commitments around operating a passenger service responsibly and having things like customer service in place.

“This is a defining moment for U.K. autonomy,” Alex Kendall, Wayve’s CEO and co-founder, said in a statement. “With Uber and our global OEM partner, we’re preparing to put our AI Driver technology into real service on the streets of London, delivering on our AV2.0 vision for scalable autonomy. Our Embodied AI learns to drive anywhere, in any vehicle, and this trial brings us closer to bringing safe and intelligent driving to everyday rides across the UK and beyond.”

Wayve recently published a blog detailing the initial findings from its “AI-500 Roadshow,” a project to visit 500 cities using a single AI model by the end of 2025. So far, the startup has hit 90 cities in 90 days, spanning Asia, Europe, and North America. The demonstration is designed to prove that Wayve’s technology can operate anywhere it’s placed, rather than relying first on mapping a region.

That’s relevant data to a company like Uber, which operates globally and has been doing deals with almost every AV company to scale its autonomous capabilities fast.

“Uber has got one of the largest mobility networks globally, so the fact that our AI can serve as their global network is a big reason why this partnership and this [driverless] trialing is so important,” Tilly Pielichaty, a Wayve spokesperson, told TechCrunch. “We are starting in the U.K., but the ambition is to take it everywhere.”",Technology

Several Waymo robotaxis and Lime e-scooters were set on fire this weekend amid unrest in downtown Los Angeles spurred by groups protesting immigration raids in the city by the Trump administration.

A group of protesters attacked five Waymo autonomous vehicles on Los Angeles Street early on Sunday evening, reports the Los Angeles Times. They slashed tires, broke windows, spray-painted anti-ICE messages, and set the cars on fire. At one point, “the besieged Waymos began honking their horns in coordinated cacophony,” the LA Times wrote.

The Times reports that some Lime e-scooters were also thrown into the burning shells of Waymo’s Jaguar I-Paces. The LAPD noted that setting fire to lithium-ion batteries releases toxic gases like hydrogen fluoride, posing a risk to bystanders.

It’s not clear why protesters attacked the Waymo vehicles. In the past, police have tapped robotaxi companies for footage to help solve crimes — in April, 404 Media reported that the LAPD published video footage obtained from a Waymo driverless car as part of an investigation into a separate hit-and-run incident.

Lime did not respond to a request for comment.

Waymo told TechCrunch the company was in touch with the LAPD and would pursue criminal prosecution of and damages from those who vandalized its robotaxis in Los Angeles over the weekend. Waymo did not respond to TechCrunch’s question about providing camera footage to authorities to identify protesters.

There have been social media reports that Waymo has removed its vehicles from LA and suspended its service. TechCrunch has reached out to Waymo to learn more.

Since Waymo launched its self-driving ride-hail service in Los Angeles in November 2024, its cars have been the target of several acts of vandalism in Los Angeles and other cities it operates in. In July 2024, a Bay Area resident was charged with vandalizing 17 Waymos in San Francisco over the course of three days.

The protests in Los Angeles began on June 6 in response to a series of aggressive ICE raids across the city, leading to the arrest of over 100 immigrants. A mix of peaceful and violent protests spread over the weekend to Paramount and Compton, and blocked major freeways.

President Trump responded by federalizing the California National Guard, and deploying up to 300 soldiers to Los Angeles. State and city officials opposed this action, with California Governor Gavin Newsom formally requesting the removal of National Guard troops, saying the move was a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said over the weekend he’s prepared to mobilize the Marines if violence continues.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/mitra-chem-is-raising-50m-for-its-cheaper-domestic-battery-materials/,"Battery material startup Mitra Chem has raised $15.6 million of a planned $50 million funding round, according to a regulatory filing seen by TechCrunch.

Mitra Chem is developing materials to make lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries store more energy. Automakers have begun to turn to LFP in an attempt to trim costs from electric vehicle battery packs, which can make up a significant portion of a car’s cost.

Currently, all LFP material comes from outside the United States, with the vast majority coming from China.

TechCrunch reached out to Mitra Chem for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.

The new funding round comes at a challenging time for battery startups. Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) haven’t grown at the rate some automakers and analysts had predicted.

Simultaneously, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have mounted an assault on EVs and battery manufacturers. The House version of the reconciliation bill would sunset EV tax credits in 2025 or 2026, depending on how many EVs automakers have sold. The Senate has yet to weigh in on the bill.

Mitra Chem previously raised a $60 million Series B that closed in 2023. GM led the round, with In-Q-Tel, Social Capital, and others participating. Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital led the startup’s $20 million Series A in 2021. South Korean battery materials company L&F Corporation is a likely participant in the new round, having invested $10 million in March, Korean Economic Daily has reported.

The company was awarded a $100 million grant from the Department of Energy last year to build a battery materials plant in Michigan. According to federal records, that award is still on the books but hasn’t yet been paid out.",Automobile

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/airpods-pro-3-could-be-on-the-way/,"In Brief

Apple didn’t unveil new hardware during Monday’s WWDC 2025, but we could still be getting updated AirPods soon.

According to Steve Moser of MacRumors, the code for the developer’s beta of iOS 26 mentions the AirPods Pro 3 alongside mentions of AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2.

This suggests that the AirPods Pro 3 could be coming soon, which would make sense, because the AirPods Pro 2 have been out for almost 3 years. Apple has also included phrasing like “AirPods Pro 2 or later” in some code, which could also nod to unreleased hardware.

Apple did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/at-wwdc-2025-apple-sang-developers-praises-amid-ai-letdowns-and-app-store-battles/,"At the end of the WWDC 2025 keynote address on Monday, the company literally sang its praises to app developers, as singer-songwriter Allen Stone humorously turned customers’ positive App Store reviews into song lyrics for a tune titled “6 out of 5 stars.”

“Best app I’ve ever set my sorry eyes upon,” he crooned. “This is not an app. It’s a piece of art.”

What Apple didn’t mention, however, was anything related to the tumultuous past few years for its developer community, or more broadly, why its developers should continue to put their trust in a company that’s fighting them for every nickel and dime while failing them in other ways.

In recent years, the Cupertino-based tech giant has put its app developer community through the wringer as it stringently fought against regulation, lawsuits, and any other efforts to rein in its alleged App Store monopoly by nations, lawmakers, and the courts.

Meanwhile, it has yet to deliver on some of the key technology advances that could modernize developers’ apps for the AI era.

In March, it delayed its “more personalized,” AI-powered Siri, demonstrated at last year’s WWDC. Apple only briefly acknowledged this fumble during this year’s keynote address, when SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said the work “needed more time” to meet Apple’s high bar.

At WWDC, Apple scattered mentions of AI related to features that Google’s AI already has, such as Apple’s AI-powered translation features, though it tried to differentiate from Google by offering lyrics translation in Apple Music. Apple’s AI-powered Visual Intelligence feature was even demonstrated by tapping into Google’s app for image search results, something that feels more native on Android devices with innovations like Circle to Search, Lens’ multisearch, visual search in videos, and more.

Elsewhere, Apple appeased developers’ demand for AI with further integrations with OpenAI technology, like the addition of ChatGPT in Apple’s Image Playground app and coding assistance in Xcode. But no deals with other AI providers were announced, despite rumors that Google Gemini integration was on the way and that Apple was teaming up with Anthropic on an AI-powered coding assistance tool.

Apple also made its scripting and automations app Shortcuts easier to use with the addition of AI features, but this ended up feeling more like a stop-gap to tide over power users until an AI Siri could take actions in their apps for them.

Then there was the deafening silence over the increasingly controversial App Store commissions.

In the U.S., for instance, Apple is fresh off a key loss in its battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games that forces Apple to now allow U.S. developers to point to alternative payment mechanisms on the web, where it can’t take a commission.

Yet Apple didn’t spend time during its hour-and-a-half-long keynote to talk about how its App Store is the best place to build an app business, improvements it’s made to payment processing systems, or how it’s weeding out scams. (It touted some of its developer benefits in the days leading up to WWDC, where it focused on its anti-fraud features and developer revenues.)

Apple also launched a standalone Games app, but the keynote address focused on the consumer benefits — Challenges, social features, easy access to Apple’s own gaming store, Arcade — not on what it could do for mobile developers.

Nor, as some had hoped, did Apple announce a reduction in its App Store commissions across the board for all developers, finally putting the question to rest as to whether Apple’s in-app payments system is worth its price.

While arguably more developer-focused improvements will roll out this week at WWDC, through its developer keynote, Platforms State of the Union, and its various sessions, Apple missed a chance to surprise its developer community with some sort of acknowledgement that it’s understood that these past years have been tough, but ultimately it’s on developers’ sides.

Instead, the only reference so far to the changing market dynamics of the App Store ecosystem was a small update to its App Review Guidelines, which has swapped out the wording “alternative app marketplace” for “alternative distribution” — a subtle reminder that Apple only thinks the only app “marketplace” that can exist is its own App Store.

As for boosting developers’ businesses, Apple seemed to be thinking of itself and its own coffers first. In the initial developer beta of iOS 26, the App Store opens up to its Search page by default, meaning that Apple is pushing developers to spend more on its App Store Search ads for discovery.

Other changes point to Apple seeing developers as just another lever to be pulled to make the company more money, while it focuses on delighting consumers with new bells and whistles, like its interface design overhaul dubbed Liquid Glass.

Though inspired by its VR headset Vision Pro, Apple didn’t offer developers an explanation as to why they should make over their perfectly functional apps to meet these new design guidelines. The company could have at least hinted at the fact that Liquid Glass seems an obvious precursor to building an operating system that will eventually extend beyond smartphones and tablets to reach new computing platforms, like AR glasses.

But Apple’s cultural preference for keeping secrets, despite years of comprehensive leaks, largely from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, kept it from suggesting that Liquid Glass was anything but an updated new look to wow consumers.

In wrapping the event by singing cheery App Store reviews (a system now beset by bots and fake reviews, as developers know), Apple tried to lighten the mood. It knew that this year’s event would let down its developer community with its AI delays, amid an aggressive pursuit of developer revenue.

The end result made the song feel like a performative act of developer appreciation — yes, an actual performance! — rather than a true reflection of how valuable developers are to Apple’s ability to ship more iPhones and make consumers happy.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/whole-foods-tells-staff-cyberattack-at-its-primary-distributor-unfi-will-affect-product-availability/,"Whole Foods told its employees that the ongoing outages and disruptions at its primary distributor, United Natural Foods (UNFI), may take “several days to resolve.”

The Amazon-owned retail giant told staff in an internal communication, seen by TechCrunch, that UNFI was experiencing a “nationwide technology system outage,” which UNFI has for its part described as a cybersecurity incident.

Whole Foods said in the communication to staff that the cyberattack is affecting UNFI’s “ability to select and ship products from their warehouses” and that this will “impact our normal delivery schedules and product availability.”

The missive to staff included instructions to limit communications with customers. The “only single approved customer talking point” that Whole Foods employees can share with customers, according to the communication, is that the grocery giant is having “temporary supply challenges.”

When reached by TechCrunch, Whole Foods spokesperson Nathan Cimbala said: “We are working to restock our shelves as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused for customers.”

Whole Foods did not say how it reached its claim that the situation may resolve in a few days.

For its part, UNFI said Wednesday that it was making progress in restoring its systems.

“We continue working steadily to safely restore our systems and provide the services our customers and suppliers know and expect from us,” UNFI spokesperson Grace Turiano told TechCrunch. “As of today, we’re gradually bringing our ordering and receiving capabilities back online, with the goal of further increasing our capacity over the coming days.”

UNFI is one of the largest food distributors in North America, supplying grocery goods and fresh produce to more than 30,000 stores and supermarkets across the U.S. and Canada. The company disclosed the cyberattack on Monday in a filing with federal regulators, and UNFI’s chief executive, Sandy Douglas, told investors this week that the company took its entire network offline on Friday after detecting the intrusion.

The company also this week reported $8.1 billion in net sales in the quarter ended May 3, 2025.

Since our reporting on Tuesday, TechCrunch has received several reports of empty shelves at some Whole Foods stores and other grocery stores reliant on UNFI. A Whole Foods store visited by this reporter on Tuesday displayed notices in several aisles saying that the store was experiencing an unspecified “temporary out of stock issue” for some products.

Much of the downstream real-world impact on grocery stores and their customers may not be seen until later this week.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/snap-plans-to-sell-lightweight-consumer-ar-glasses-in-2026/,"Snap is back with a new pair of AR smart glasses, and for the first time in years, it’s ready to sell them to consumers.

The company plans to sell these new glasses, called Specs, to consumers starting in 2026, CEO Evan Spiegel announced on Tuesday during the Augmented World Expo in Long Beach, California. A Snap spokesperson tells TechCrunch the glasses will ship in 2026, as well.

Snap’s Specs will feature many of the same augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities that are available on the company’s developer-facing smart glasses, the Spectacles 5. However, the company says the Specs will be smaller and lighter — ideally making them more innocuous to wear in public than their extremely large predecessors.

The Specs will feature see-through lenses capable of displaying graphics to users as if they were projected on the world in front of them. The glasses will also feature an AI assistant powered by Snap’s technology, capable of processing both audio and video.

The Specs announcement comes nearly a decade after Snap first attempted to sell consumer smart glasses with the initial launch of Spectacles in 2016 — a product that ended up selling poorly. While Snap was ahead of its time then, the company now faces fierce competition in the AR glasses market from giants like Meta and Google, which have recently unveiled AR products of their own.

Meta reportedly plans to unveil glasses with a built-in screen, codenamed “Hypernova,” later in 2025. Meanwhile, Google recently announced partnerships with Warby Parker, Samsung, and other companies to develop its Android XR smart glasses.

Snap is hoping its SnapOS developer ecosystem — which the company has spent the last several years building out — will give it an edge in the AR race. Many of the millions of AR experiences developers have built for Snapchat and Spectacles, called Lenses, will also work on the new Specs, the company said.

Onstage, Spiegel showcased a few of these lenses. One of them, “Super Travel,” will translate signs and menus for users in foreign countries. Another app Spiegel showcased, “Cookmate,” finds recipes based on available ingredients in a user’s kitchen, and then offers step-by-step cooking guidance.

Companies have been demoing these use cases in AR for years but have struggled to deliver a pair of smart glasses that are capable, affordable, and comfortable enough to give everyday consumers a taste of AR. Snap seems to believe it’s done just that with Specs, but several details are still unclear.

Snap did not reveal on Tuesday how much the Specs will cost, how it plans to sell the glasses, or what exactly they look like.

Snap also announced several developer updates to bolster its SnapOS platform. Developers can now build apps powered by multimodal AI models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind. To enable more AI apps, the company announced a “Depth Module API” that will anchor AR graphics from large language models in three-dimensional space.

In the future, Snap says it will be partnering with Niantic Spatial, the company that spun off from the creator of Pokémon Go, to build AI-powered maps of the world.

Whether all of these efforts will translate into a pair of smart glasses that consumers will truly want to buy remains to be seen. While Meta has found early success with Ray-Ban Meta, it seems likely that Snap’s Specs will be significantly more expensive. To get consumers on board, Snap may have to turn AR glasses from something novel into a practical device.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/mistral-releases-a-pair-of-ai-reasoning-models/,"French AI lab Mistral is getting into the reasoning AI model game.

On Tuesday morning, Mistral announced Magistral, its first family of reasoning models. Like other reasoning models — e.g. OpenAI’s o3 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro — Magistral works through problems step-by-step for improved consistency and reliability across topics such as math and physics.

Magistral comes in two flavors: Magistral Small and Magistral Medium. Magistral Small is 24 billion parameters in size, and is available for download from the AI dev platform Hugging Face under a permissive Apache 2.0 license. (Parameters are the internal components of a model that guide its behavior.) Magistral Medium, a more capable model, is in preview on Mistral’s Le Chat chatbot platform and the company’s API, as well as third-party partner clouds.

“[Magistral is] suited for a wide range of enterprise use cases, from structured calculations and programmatic logic to decision trees and rule-based systems,” writes Mistral in the blog post. “[The models are] fine-tuned for multi-step logic, improving interpretability and providing a traceable thought process in the user’s language.”

Founded in 2023, Mistral is a frontier model lab building a range of AI-powered services, including the aforementioned Le Chat and mobile apps. It’s backed by venture investors like General Catalyst, and has raised over €1.1 billion (roughly $1.24 billion) to date.

Despite its formidable resources, Mistral has lagged behind other leading AI labs in certain areas, like developing reasoning models. Magistral doesn’t appear to be an especially competitive release, either, judging by Mistral’s own benchmarks.

On GPQA Diamond and AIME, tests that evaluate a model’s physics, math, and science skills, Magistral Medium underperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4. Magistral Medium also fails to surpass Gemini 2.5 Pro on a popular programming benchmark, LiveCodeBench.

Perhaps that’s why Mistral touts Magistral’s other strengths in its blog post. Magistral delivers answers at “10x” the speed of competitors in Le Chat, Mistral claims, and supports a wide array of languages, including Italian, Arabic, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

“Building on our flagship models, Magistral is designed for research, strategic planning, operational optimization, and data-driven decision making,” the company writes in its post, “whether executing risk assessment and modelling with multiple factors, or calculating optimal delivery windows under constraints.”

The release of Magistral comes after Mistral debuted a “vibe coding” client, Mistral Code. A few weeks prior to that, Mistral launched several coding-focused models and rolled out Le Chat Enterprise, a corporate-focused chatbot service that offers tools like an AI agent builder and integrates Mistral’s models with third-party services like Gmail and SharePoint.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/love-it-or-hate-it-apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-getting-mixed-reviews/,"Some users and designers are already panning Apple’s new user interface dubbed Liquid Glass, even though it’s a bit early. There are reasons to think it might improve — but also valid critiques.

While arguably the operating system design overhaul looks unfinished in many parts — notifications are too hard to read, and then there’s that monstrosity of the Control Center overlay — what Apple has shipped so far is the first developer beta, not a final release. There’s still time for many of the design systems’ current problems to be refined and corrected by the time Apple launches iOS 26 and its other OS updates to the public later this fall.

The dramatic refresh to the iPhone’s look and feel was announced at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference and described by Apple as its “broadest design update ever.” Liquid Glass, the company explained, would span across Apple’s platforms, unifying the experience of using Apple devices.

Image Credits:Apple

Inspired by Apple’s Vision Pro VR headset, Liquid Glass is so named because it leverages the optical quality of glass in its elements — it refracts light and features translucent materials. The update also modernizes the operating system’s interface in a way that seems obviously poised to later extend to other devices, like AR glasses.

However, there are parts of the interface where various elements are simply too hard to read — and not only for low-vision users (or the middle-aged). Even Apple’s press release includes a photo of the Apple Music user interface, where it’s difficult to make out the artist’s name in its light gray font on a translucent bar. That’s concerning because this is a photo Apple approved, which seemingly would indicate that this part of the OS update, at least, is finished.

Image Credits:Apple

Other users are sharing similar concerns about the legibility of reading through their notifications on the iPhone’s Lock Screen, where, depending on the colors of your background wallpaper, the text becomes either easier or harder to read as you scroll.

This issue can even be observed in the footage of Apple’s WWDC keynote address, where glassy notifications seem to require a bit of squinting to parse.

As developers and other curious tech enthusiasts began testing the initial beta, they realized the problem with reading notifications was even worse when the iPhone’s wallpaper was brighter, with lighter colors. Here, the white text nearly fades away into the background in parts. Maybe Apple is helping us wean ourselves off our screen time addictions?

The iOS 26 Control Center is also almost unusable in the first developer beta, as there’s little background blur to hide the Home Screen’s icons and widgets behind the Center’s various controls, buttons, and sliders. Surely Apple designers don’t think this is the final product? Why didn’t they at least increase the background blur before shipping?

This is unfinished work that needs more than a slight adjustment.

yeah i cant defend this pic.twitter.com/MmFQ4hMjba — Holly – I like tech (@AnxiousHolly) June 10, 2025

There’s room to criticize other choices, too, like Home Screen animations that miss the mark — but these are likely unfinished. Or so we’d hope.

POV: You’re a tech founder with no experience in consumer and you hire the the first guy on Dribbble when searching “pop animation” pic.twitter.com/npYH8IqSjT — Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) June 10, 2025

Despite its initial flaws, there are signs that the updated design system will receive more attention to detail over time, even if that’s not as obvious in this first release due to its more glaring issues.

For starters, Apple’s icons look beautiful in their new glassy style (not designed by a marketing committee this time), and some of the effects involving morphing buttons are impressive. Moving Liquid Glass overlays over the Home Screen blurs and stretches icons in the background as if an actual piece of glass were being pulled over top.

These are some fantastic new icons. I love the new Camera app icon. pic.twitter.com/VbCxnzubc7 — Sebastiaan de With (@sdw) June 9, 2025

Can I please shake the hand of developers who made this happen?! 🤝



I salute you with respect 🫡pic.twitter.com/APBPl0ckzs — Oykun (@oykun) June 10, 2025

There are other subtle touches that make the design’s elements feel like glass, like the way the “Customize” button reflects the colors of the different wallpapers above it as you scroll through them while personalizing your Home Screen. The feature may still need to be refined, but it’s an example that demonstrates Liquid Glass was not some sort of rush job on Apple’s part.

I actually gasped when I saw this for the first time, they ain’t playin around https://t.co/5fcJVmem66 — Parker Ortolani (@ParkerOrtolani) June 10, 2025

Even Apple’s competitors have taken notice.

“Liquid Glass … I kinda love it?” posted Nothing CEO Carl Pei on X, who recently theorized that the future of smartphones will involve interacting with AI through the operating system itself, not necessarily through running apps.

Liquid Glass seems better positioned for such a world, where the interfaces of the apps become the focus as their icons fade away into the background — even, optionally, becoming clear glass.

Of course, there are concerns that Apple won’t be able to balance the iPhone’s battery usage that its new eye-candy demands — especially on older devices — but we won’t know if that’s true until the company ships a final version of iOS.

Apple, however, tried to appease users’ anxiety on this front by explaining during its WWDC keynote address that the advances it made in its hardware, silicon, and graphics technologies have paved the way for this type of user interface.

Plus, Apple already offers a way to toggle off some of its more power-hungry effects and motions to save on battery life, and that will likely be true for Liquid Glass as well.

It’s also worth remembering that Apple’s last major overhaul of its mobile operating system, iOS 7, was similarly unrefined upon its first release. The initial beta featured unreadable UI elements and thin lines and fonts that led to some criticism about usability and form over function. Over time, that design was improved, and now it’s thought of as just how the iPhone’s software looks — if it’s thought of at all.

The same will likely hold true for Liquid Glass … eventually.",Technology

https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/,"ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.

OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.

OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini

OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.



PROMPT:



Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.

OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

FAQs:

A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Can ChatGPT write essays?

Yes.

Can ChatGPT commit libel?

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Does ChatGPT have an app?

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

What is the ChatGPT character limit?

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Can ChatGPT be detected?

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.

Are ChatGPT chats public?

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",Technology

In the words of Editor Frederic Lardinois, who is on the ground in Las Vegas right in the midst of all things re:Invent 2024:

“As far as re:Invent keynotes go, there was plenty of news, but the overall experience felt a bit disjointed, with AWS CEO Matt Garman going deep into the weeds of some new and existing services at the start. He was then upstaged by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announcing new foundation models — which was maybe the marquee moment of the event so far — only to then have to go back to announce updates to Amazon Q and SageMaker.”

Those new models include four text generators, an image generation model and a video generation model, all of which follow the new Nova naming convention.

“We’ve continued to work on our own frontier models,” Jassy said, “and those frontier models have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last four to five months. And we figured, if we were finding value out of them, you would probably find value out of them.”

https://techcrunch.com/storyline/tesla-robotaxi-event-follow-elon-musks-big-reveals-here/,"Anthony Levandowski, the engineer who co-founded Google’s self-driving car program (AKA Waymo) and has gone on to start an off-road AV startup, hopped on the phone with me after Tesla’s big robotaxi reveal to share his thoughts. And he is bullish on Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla’s and the world’s future, but he’s not without his, albeit small, reservations.

“I think the issue isn’t building the car without a steering wheel, it’s making the software work,” Levandowski told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of gap between driving around on a track at an amusement park and driving around in Los Angeles traffic. The optimism is there. The realism is what’s coming next, and that will be where the hard part is.”

The engineer agreed with Musk’s vision-only approach to self-driving, rather than using “expensive sensors,” and said full self-driving appears to be in reach. He noted that while Waymo already has fully operational driverless robotaxis in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, it’s a “much more engineer-heavy and sensory-heavy approach.”

“But to scale that out to the masses, you need something that’s affordable,” he said. Levandowski noted that he was really looking for Tesla to announce breakthroughs in its FSD software, which it will need if it wants to get to unsupervised FSD by next year.

When it comes to the business model, Levandowski said he loved the idea of the Cybercabs being available for sale eventually.

“You’re putting the power back into the people’s hands, where a small business owner could have, you know, a fleet of 10 cars or 20 cars that they run themselves as their business. It’s a great model for the future where it’s lots of mom and pops, rather than one mega corp that does that.”

The engineer said he agrees with Tesla’s vision of the future overall, but doesn’t expect it to come anytime soon, and certainly not within the timelines Musk sets.

“If you can’t start a webcast on time, maybe your prediction for 2026 is a little ambitious,” Levandowski said, referencing Musk’s stated timeline that the Cybercab would start production in 2026. (Also, the event apparently started late because a guest had a medical emergency, but Musk’s timelines are famously too optimistic.)

Levandowski also said he was bullish on the Optimus robots, which were mingling with guests at the event Thursday.

“But it’s a longer term bullish,” he said. “It’s not bullish this year. It’s a bullish over time…Robots in general are going to be the biggest product. They’re gonna be way bigger than Tesla cars, but they’re much further away than full self-driving cars.”",Automobile

https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/metas-v-jepa-2-model-teaches-ai-to-understand-its-surroundings/,"Meta on Wednesday unveiled its new V-JEPA 2 AI model, a “world model” that is designed to help AI agents understand the world around them.

V-JEPA 2 is an extension of the V-JEPA model that Meta released last year, which was trained on over 1 million hours of video. This training data is supposed to help robots or other AI agents operate in the physical world, understanding and predicting how concepts like gravity will impact what happens next in a sequence.

These are the kinds of common sense connections that small children and animals make as their brains develop — when you play fetch with a dog, for example, the dog will (hopefully) understand how bouncing a ball on the ground will cause it to rebound upward, or how it should run toward where it thinks the ball will land, and not where the ball is at that precise moment.

Meta depicts examples where a robot may be confronted with, for example, the point-of-view of holding a plate and a spatula and walking toward a stove with cooked eggs. The AI can predict that a very likely next action would be to use the spatula to move the eggs to the plate.

According to Meta, V-JEPA 2 is 30x faster than Nvidia’s Cosmos model, which also tries to enhance intelligence related to the physical world. However, Meta may be evaluating its own models according to different benchmarks than Nvidia.

https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/capital-one/from-insights-to-action-advancing-agentic-ai/,"The frontier of AI is rapidly advancing, but among the public and even in the enterprise, an understanding of its capabilities hasn’t always kept pace. The widely held view of AI often gets stuck on the image of a sophisticated chatbot, capable of engaging in a conversation with a user and providing a response to prompts. But this way of thinking is also a limitation, boxing the technology into something as simple as trading messages and images. It misses both the nuance and full potential of state-of-the-art, real-world applications.

As businesses, societies, and technical practitioners alike seek to unlock the value of AI, tapping an expanded set of capabilities has become a top priority. Capital One has delivered a recent breakthrough by building a new multi-agentic conversational AI assistant for car buyers.

Capital One has a long history of using data, technology, and analytics to deliver superior financial services products and services for millions of customers. For over a decade, the business has been on a technology transformation journey to rebuild its tech stack, scale its technology workforce, and extend machine learning across the business. This dedication to innovation has positioned the company at the forefront of enterprises creating industry-leading AI advances today.

“We are continually exploring ways to enhance the customer experience at the frontier of AI. As we dug into new ways to improve the shopping experience with AI, we were looking at how to provide natural and satisfying interactions based on the way humans interact and reason,” says Dr. Milind Naphade, SVP of Technology, AI Foundations at Capital One. “We wanted to transform the customer experience by replacing the previous generation of conversational AI technology with an agentic approach that leverages large language models (LLMs). We knew we needed to build a solution that would be able to really interact with a customer, understand their needs, and take actions on their behalf while they searched for a new vehicle.”

The result: Chat Concierge from Capital One. The proprietary multi-agentic conversational AI assistant is custom-built to enhance the experience for car buyers and dealers alike. But answering questions and organizing information is only one part of what Chat Concierge can do.

Model advances have enabled the dawn of AI agents that are trained to work together and tackle a series of complex tasks. Each AI agent performs a specific duty based on the user’s request. Breaking a given workflow into discrete tasks and assigning each task to an AI agent can help ease the cognitive load of the user and create a more streamlined, satisfying experience. It’s almost like building a dream team where each member is assigned to a role fitting their strengths.

With Chat Concierge, multiple AI agents work together to not only provide information to the customer, but to take specific actions based on the customer’s preferences and needs. For example, one agent communicates with the customer. Another creates an action plan based on business rules and the tools it is allowed to use. A third agent evaluates the accuracy of the first two, and a fourth agent that explains and validates the action plan with the user.

In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can present information like vehicle comparisons and specifications, then take the next step by scheduling appointments and test drives with a sales team. “There is a complex workflow that is getting executed behind the scenes, but it’s all happening behind the scenes,” Naphade explains.

These advances come as a logical progression from generative AI to AI agents that understand their environment, make decisions, and take actions. This requires an underlying infrastructure where the data and application programming interfaces (APIs) are AI-ready. “We are standing on the shoulders of all the giant systems Capital One has built so far,” Naphade says. “For example, we are one of the only banks that has fully committed to a public cloud. The data-driven, machine learning heritage of Capital One precedes us.”

The possibilities for agentic AI–and future advances in the field–continue to evolve at a rapid clip. State of the art reasoning models are now designed to handle complex tasks by thinking through multiple steps and reasoning logically. Using these models to create AI agents brings the potential to help people turn insights into action for a range of sophisticated tasks that were never possible before. For instance, they have the potential to help solve real-world challenges like working together to tackle complex, PhD-level research problems; work with a company’s developers to autonomously support the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment; or even help a new business create a business plan and financial models along with a logo, website, and marketing plans.

While the pace of AI innovation excels, so does the need for thoughtful approaches that balance speed with risk management. Capital One has tested, learned, and adapted its multi-agentic conversational AI workflow to create a great customer experience, in real-time, while also mitigating hallucination and errors through strong guardrails.

In continuing to advance the state of the art in AI, Capital One isn’t just inventing new tools and technology. It’s delivering the right help at the right time—with intelligent, dynamically adaptive approaches—for more than 100 million customers.

Overtaxed tech teams aren’t always prepared to handle every obstacle internally, and meanwhile, the work of business teams is too detailed for one-size-fits-all fixes. A field as specialized as finance demands solutions to match its complexities.

With advanced generative AI capabilities and deep institutional expertise from an experienced team, GenerativeX has already guided the pharmaceutical industry into the twenty-first century. This growing AI sophistication is now driving impact in finance, with precisely customized solutions to meet diverse needs. Instead of generic LLM assistance, GenerativeX’s AI agents are fine-tuned for financial services, informing executive strategy and eliminating tedious busywork with targeted use cases. Banking, private equity, insurance, asset management — each has room for improvement in their day-to-day. No matter the sector, no matter the business, GenerativeX’s AI agents can strengthen finance operations and recover valuable time for more effective work.

Individuality is vital in any approach to AI; its offerings must contour to the goals and workflows of a given client. AI output must take a shape that’s recognizable and useful to its intended audience: analysts can receive reports as word-processing documents or slide decks, conversational chatbots simulate in-person interactions for sales and negotiation, and higher-level ops teams can access dashboards presenting important insights at a glance. For financial institutions, being able to choose the solutions that most directly address what makes them unique creates a shorter route to success.

Consider the example of mergers and acquisitions, a field poised for overhaul with the help of AI. From end to end, the compiling of proposals for target companies can be drastically condensed with AI-driven automation, with each interconnected agent executing its designated role. Once supplied with information on the companies in question, a target analysis agent generates investment hypotheses, passing them to an orchestrator agent that coordinates research, comparative analysis, valuation, and slide-deck generation agents, while incorporating iterative feedback from a human banker at every stage. In a fraction of the time required to do so manually, a full-scale proposal comes together. Action can be taken with greater confidence, new hires learn on the job more easily, and everyone saves precious time. One major global financial institution has experienced the transformative impact of GenerativeX’s M&A agent with a 30% jump in their output of individual proposals.

AI agents can also carry a proposal through to execution, but M&A is only scratching the surface of what this technology can do for the world of finance. In real estate, AI can forecast the price of a designated property, automate the work of due diligence, and prepare transaction documents. For wealth management, it speeds up processes like succession planning, will preparation, and trust formation. Investment professionals benefit from AI-driven systems to screen deals, generate financial models, and garner committee support. Other use cases serve finance across various sectors, with the particulars adjusted for each specific business; compliance solutions, for one, are informed by each client’s internal policies. Trading, credit, insurance—AI services are changing the terrain everywhere, helping professionals navigate the complex world of finance with ease.

AI’s usefulness in securitization shows this adaptability in full force: an analyst begins the process by engaging a specialized AI orchestrator trained on the client’s proprietary knowledge database. The orchestrator then collaborates with a trust agent to review legal agreements, identifying key structural elements—such as involved parties, account relationships, and conditional triggers. The Excel agent fully automates complex financial modeling for investment banks and private equity funds. It can seamlessly handle selecting comparables, adjusting assumptions based on market information, and automating valuations and sensitivity analyses in an end-to-end process. Traditionally, analysts spend most of their time debugging models, but the Excel agent can now perform both debugging and insight generation, allowing one financial institution to save 80% of their time—a dramatic leap in both efficiency and insight.

Like any field running on data, finance involves a lot of repetitive tasks that eat up on-the-job hours without capitalizing on our human advantages. With GenerativeX’s AI solutions, we can all get these pieces of our workday back, and direct our intelligence where it’ll have a more meaningful impact. But the future of AI extends beyond streamlining and time savings to untapped new horizons of innovation in finance. Through GenerativeX’s multi-agent AI systems, users gain more leverage from their time: markets can be predicted with sharper intelligence, deals are made with less friction, and wealth goes farther. Everything’s getting smarter, and money is catching up.

And this is just the beginning, only one instance of the optimization that AI will put within reach of other domains and industries. The AI-driven speed and certitude that keep high finance running smoothly are becoming the new general standard, a swifter cadence for conducting business. As this sea change continues, the flexible, adaptable solutions of GenerativeX will be ready for whatever challenges might arise. The same targeted attention and customization that’s driving the next evolution in finance can benefit anyone, anywhere. AI doesn’t just go where it’s needed; it becomes what is needed.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/oracle/six-things-startups-and-everyone-else-should-know-in-the-ai-era/,"By Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

The hype around AI continues to grow, and the technology is moving faster than even the most optimistic forecasts, reshaping what’s possible for startups almost overnight. While it’s always fun to discuss pie-in-the-sky ideas, the real question is not just what AI can do, but what it should do for your business.

Startups need measurable results: better products, faster time to market, smarter customer insights, and new revenue streams. What matters most is aligning AI with these business objectives and using infrastructure that can empower you to keep up with your competition, support growth, and please customers.

From my conversations with business leaders, the most important considerations fall into three categories:

Can I do what I do today more efficiently— faster, cheaper, or with fewer resources?

Can I grow my customer base faster and/or deliver more value to existing users?

Can I deliver new revenue from products or services I hadn’t previously considered?

The answers to these questions should help you decide where to spend time, where to invest, and how to build AI into your business.

Below are six key areas that you and other startup founders should keep in mind as you put AI to work.

1: Focus is critical

For startups, every decision matters, especially when evaluating AI choices. It’s important to make sure these investments are directly connected to business goals. Start by asking the three questions above and use the answers to help you choose the infrastructure tools needed to support your direction. In a world of distractions, focus gives you an edge. Pick tools that free up your time to solve the most important problems for your business.

One of the biggest advantages startups have today is the ability to fail fast and iterate rapidly. We’re now seeing a shift where rapid experimentation isn’t just for early-stage companies anymore. We recently worked with several customers in the core AI space that went from proof of concept to full-scale AI deployment in under three months. A year ago, that might’ve taken 12 months. Pick a cloud infrastructure partner that works the same way, enabling you to test quickly, iterate faster, and scale when you need. Focus isn’t about doing less – it’s about meeting customer needs faster.

2: Change is constant

The AI landscape isn’t just evolving—it may be accelerating faster than any other technology wave in the history of mankind. And now a new phase of agentic applications is upon us. This next wave of AI workloads will be defined by thousands of agents designed to talk to each other in short bursts to perform tasks. Imagine AI agents handling your DMV registration: one handles authentication, another takes payment, and another schedules delivery – all without you clicking through 10 screens.

This shift demands a new foundation. For this to work, agents need a standard way to talk to each other and access their data sources quickly. The Model Context Protocol is important in paving the way for a wave of AI-driven agentic applications which are designed to fetch and return responses to questions with minimal human help. Many of these applications are already emerging, with broader adoption likely in the next 12 to 18 months.

Startups seeking to capitalize on this shift must prioritize infrastructure that delivers real-time data access, low-latency networking, and the elasticity required to power agent-based ecosystems.

3: Innovation at every layer

The rapid growth of AI is driven by innovation across the entire stack, not only in the latest silicon, but in computer science techniques governing how LLMs work. Understanding this full range of innovation is crucial for staying ahead.

Take KV caching, which is the ability to reuse previous calculations for inferencing instead of recalculating everything at every step. This has the ability to save time, compute power, and money—essential factors for startups. Then there’s the Mixture of Experts technique that allows LLMs to break down complex problems and delegate each piece of the puzzle to the model—and associated infrastructure—best suited to handle it. For example, some tasks might be best served at lower cost if they run through CPUs rather than pricier GPUs. That is true for jobs relying on structured data originating in relational databases and applications, like Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, that run on them.

When a business’s AI stack is optimized across layers, from data to model to compute, it can gain both efficiency and flexibility. This kind of innovation builds over time, and it starts with choosing infrastructure designed to support it.

4: Data remains core

Applications change all the time, but one thing remains constant: their reliance on large volumes of data, often in varying formats depending on the use case. As AI evolves toward more agentic and autonomous systems, the amount of data generated and consumed is growing exponentially. The more these systems interact, the more important it is to keep data close to where it’s being processed.

In many cases that means placing data as close as possible to required LLMs to minimize round trips that sap network performance. With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), storage, compute, and models live side-by-side, helping to remove performance bottlenecks and maximize throughput.

Supporting AI workloads effectively while staying cost-efficient requires using a range of storage types tailored to different stages of the data lifecycle. OCI offers high-performance file systems like File Storage with Lustre for training large models, Object Storage for managing unstructured data, and Archive Storage for long-term retention, all designed to meet the price performance demands of AI-driven architectures.

Oracle brings decades of experience managing mission-critical data into our autonomous data platform. With OCI, startups can:

Seamlessly integrate advanced LLMs from a variety of providers or create your own

Parlay insights from Oracle Cloud Fusion Applications to feed their models

Tap directly into data from Oracle Database without additional integration overhead

Faster, direct access to the data not only enables improved system performance but also lays the foundation for quicker, more informed decision-making.

5: Commoditization continues

The path of technological evolution is clear: hardware horsepower rises as the price for that power is stabilizing. That trend will continue and, as noted before, innovation around the improved technology will carry on as well.

As a startup, take advantage of that commoditization and the flexibility it enables, without losing track of the problem you’re solving. What’s the value proposition, and how can cloud-powered AI help you build on it?

The right infrastructure foundation should support the pace without forcing trade-offs between cost, performance, and simplicity.

6: Be on the lookout for net-new business

Keeping your eye on the prize is critical but it doesn’t mean wearing blinders. AI is not just a tool enabling optimization—it can be a catalyst to discover completely new ideas.

While your business goals and product roadmap are being advanced, it’s important to stay alert to new opportunities that AI might surface. These may be in adjacent areas or perhaps crop up out of the blue in some orthogonal way.

Take a startup helping restaurants optimize staffing schedules. The original product is simple: use past data and forecasts to reduce overstaffing and minimize staff burnout. But over time, its AI models started surfacing that demand surges don’t match historical foot traffic. Digging deeper, the startup realized the spikes correlate with local events, weather shifts, and even social media trends about specific menu items. That insight turns into a new product altogether: a hyperlocal demand prediction API, not just for restaurants but for brands, delivery platforms, or anyone trying to forecast foot traffic and purchasing behavior. That’s not an iteration – that’s a new category creation. And it happened by noticing a signal no one was looking for.

These are the kinds of opportunities AI can unlock, helping to move from cost savings to net-new revenue and long-term business value. That’s the real potential of deploying AI with purpose: not just automation, but meaningful growth.

Speed Alone Isn’t Enough

With so much innovation across infrastructure, models, and applications, it’s easy to get caught up in chasing the newest thing. Startups are inclined to move fast and test boundaries, but sustainable impact comes from knowing where to focus.

The question is not whether to adopt AI, but where to apply it. Every initiative needs to tie back to a clear objective, whether it’s improving efficiency, accelerating customer growth, or creating new revenue. Startups that stay grounded in practical outcomes and align with the right partners are most likely to lead the next wave of innovation.

Success in AI won’t be about who moves first, but who moves with purpose, concentrates on the right problem, and makes sure the infrastructure, data, and models are aligned to solve it.

As a first-time visitor to Silicon Valley, Eddie Yu, founder of OKOsix navigated the unknown in tandem with his fellow founders, shared a flat, forged lasting bonds, and emerged from his cocoon of uncertainty with newfound confidence endowed by the Global Booster, a six-month programme organised by HKSTP, partnering with global innovation platform Plug and Play, a move to assert growth ambitions of the I&T ecosystem, provides comprehensive training and fundraising support tailored to business development needs for each startup .

“Together, we practiced and refined our presentation until it was pitch-perfect,” he recalled. Not only did he willed interests from 80 potential investors for its specialty in compostable solutions, some of them flew in Hong Kong for due diligence and see if there are even more potential for the biodegradable materials applied beyond the use in disposable medical, hygiene, and personal care products.

The unforgettable experience dubbed “once in a lifetime” by Eddie himself, offering invaluable insights that significantly changed OKOsix’s trajectory, refining plans to scale manufacturing, and adapting to global demand – this realignment allowed him to adjust fundraising strategies to prioritize growth stages. Eddie also expressed gratitude for the time spent with four other startup founders. “Their businesses are much more mature than mine,” he said, “and became a kind of guidance and inspiration for me.” The sentiment extends to the local community in more ways than one, ultimately leading to the recruitment of their new Chief Innovation Officer with a doctorate in chemistry at Stanford University, and financial advisors each chiming in respective expertise.

Said with amusement, “I still remember the looks on other countries’ startup representatives when they learned about our programme, astounded and envious in equal measure!”

Even the Intangible Gains are Off the Charts

GoGoChart serves a diverse range of enterprise customers across various industries, notably mobile gaming and finance, with an impressive portfolio boasting over 2,000 clients, GoGoChart has distinguished itself as a pioneering provider of strategies and solutions in digital marketing.

The app had its visibility optimized and conversions driven by strong online presence, tinkering with strategic boosts, algorithms for ranking, ratings, keywords, and store listings, the list goes on. Though, competition in the field remains tough nonetheless, the solution carried spotlight as a rising star in startup awards from both Deloitte and Financial Times. Given its track record, participating in the programme was a logical step for GoGoChart, empowering them to expand into the US market.

While this visit was not his first, Daniel Lo, CEO of GoGoChart found an even deeper connection with the business culture and community this time. Described as one of those awakening moments, he delved deeply into engaging with locals, and gaining a profound understanding of how the ecosystem operates.

Lo recounted: “Each day began with an early morning start, Plug and Play curated a packed schedule of sessions with mentors and investors, so we get to make the most of our time together. Dinners often featured engaging conversations with individuals from various professional backgrounds. As night fell on the West Coast, a new day began in Hong Kong; we founders worked late into the morning to stay on the line with our teams.”

He further explained that weekends often presented with unique opportunities for their professional networks to flourish. “We’d invite our new connections back to our place for a bite and get-togethers, strengthening trusts and bonds.” he said.

Despite setbacks and rejections, the networking effort ultimately paid off handsomely when Lightspeed Venture Partners, a prominent multi-stage venture capital firm, invited GoGoChart to conduct a health check on the digital marketing strategies of their portfolio companies, and from there, GoGoChart has demonstrated remarkable growth at a compound rate.

“I had the privilege of braving the unknown alongside my fellow founders in Silicon Valley,” Lo still recalled with excitement. “One particularly memorable moment was when we boldly decided to cold-pitch venture capitalists at a café in Menlo Park – a hub for these investors to congregate and share their insights.”

“Perhaps the least tangible – yet most rewarding thing – was the opportunity to surround myself with the world’s brightest minds, which only served to make me humbler and more cognizant of the importance of hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.” he reflected.

The Global Booster Programme has been hailed as a transformative experience to empower startups in breaking new grounds while fostering their founders’ personal growth, as an epitome of values HKSTP holds at heart, the “booster bunch” for the second cohort is now ready to fly from the city to markets around the world, entrepreneurship will no longer perceived as a solo journey, but an exploration odyssey.",Technology
https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/skf/the-faroe-islands-space-program-harnesses-the-moons-energy-while-staying-on-earth/,"As nations and private companies race to mine the Moon and beyond, a new frontier in space exploration is emerging—one that stays right here on Earth. The Faroe Islands Space Program is redefining exploration by harnessing the Moon’s gravitational pull to generate clean, predictable tidal energy. With 80% of global energy still derived from fossil fuels, the need for sustainable alternatives has never been more urgent. Tidal energy, with a global potential of 650 GW, remains vastly underutilized, yet could play an important part of the future energy mix. By leveraging the ocean’s natural rhythms, this initiative challenges traditional views on space exploration and highlights the need to make the most of the resources we already have.

“We estimate there are at least 3000 more “Faroe Islands” out there qualifying for our space program – if they all join, moon energy could replace all coal power capacity currently under development globally”, says Martin Edlund, CEO of Minesto, one of the initiators of the Faroe Islands Space Program.

Luna 12 is turning the tide for renewable energy

For the past year, global industry leader SKF, ocean energy developer Minesto, and one of the world’s smallest national energy companies, Sev, have been piloting Luna 12— a cutting-edge tidal kite designed to harness the Moon’s gravitational pull for predictable, renewable tidal energy off the coast of the Faroe Islands. Luna 12 is the first mega-watt kite at a capacity of 1.2 MW – enough to power 200 homes annually, no matter the weather. Following its success, the partners have demonstrated that tidal energy can be both cost-competitive and scalable—unlocking a powerful, untapped resource that could reshape the future of clean energy.

Now, as operations in the Faroe Islands transition to the next phase, SKF and Minesto are launching the Faroe Islands Space Program. The next goal of the program is to implement a 200 MW tidal energy array, supporting the small island nation’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030. Once operational, the facility could supply 40% of the territory’s expected electricity needs, delivering clean, reliable energy to its 50,000 residents and 70,000 sheep in this remote North Atlantic archipelago.

How SKF and Minesto are engineering innovation for a sustainable future

Since its founding in 1907, SKF has been at the forefront of innovation in bearings, seals, condition monitoring systems, lubrication systems, and related services—all designed with one primary goal: reducing friction. With applications spanning over 40 industries, these technologies play a crucial role in fighting friction and improving efficiency. Research shows that 20 percent of all energy consumed globally is used to overcome friction. By minimizing it, we can optimize resource use, particularly in energy production, where every unit generated should contribute to the power grid rather than being lost to friction.

“Imagine a future powered by the tides of the Moon. This unique project dares to dream big and is exploring the potential of renewable tidal energy. At SKF we are proud to be a part of this down-to-earth project that aligns with our values and our ambition to create a more sustainable world,” says Annika Ölme, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of SKF.

Tethered to the seabed at a depth of ~50 meters and operating at speeds of 16 knots, the 12-meter-long (39.4-foot) Luna 12 kite withstands extreme forces, demanding precise engineering for smooth, controlled movement and durability. SKF was brought on board by Minesto to design the bearing and sealing systems for its rudders and elevators, optimizing performance under harsh conditions. Using advanced software, SKF also calculates bearing lifespan and CO2 emissions, helping engineers balance technical efficiency with sustainability. This initiative clearly shows how collaboration across industries is essential for progress. ”Together with Minesto, we are demonstrating how technology and innovation can drive the transition to renewable energy”, says Annika Ölme.

Why renewable and predictable moon energy is important for the Faroe Islands

The Moon’s gravitational pull is responsible for approximately 70% of tidal movement, making tidal energy, in essence, ‘moon energy’. Unlike solar, wind, and hydro power, which fluctuate with the weather, tidal energy is 100% predictable as it depends on the Moon’s orbit, which remains stable over long timescales. This predictability makes tidal energy a uniquely reliable renewable source.

The Faroe Islands’ slow-moving underwater currents pose a challenge for traditional tidal power systems, which struggle to generate sufficient energy in such conditions. This makes the region an ideal test site for Luna 12, a tidal kite designed to operate efficiently in low-flow environments. Using hydrodynamic lift, Luna 12 propels itself through ocean currents like a wind kite. Its autonomous control system steers it in a figure-eight trajectory, significantly increasing the speed of water flow through its turbine—allowing it to generate energy even in areas where conventional turbines fall short.

Sev, the Faroese municipally owned energy company, is actively supporting tidal energy development and has built key infrastructure to integrate Luna 12 into the electrical grid. With abundant natural resources and predictable tides, this project could play a crucial role in the Faroe Islands’ goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2030. “We believe that tidal power may prove to become a vital part of this journey,” says Hákun Djurhuus, CEO of the Faroese electricity company Sev.

The Faroe Islands Space Program highlights how knowledge-sharing and collaboration drive sustainability, showcasing tidal energy’s vast untapped potential in the renewable energy landscape. It underscores the importance of leveraging existing natural resources to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/oracle/modal-founder-on-simplifying-ai-infrastructure-with-oracle-cloud-infrastructure/,"With offices in New York, Stockholm, and San Francisco, Modal is redefining how developers build and scale AI-based applications, providing a serverless platform that eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.

Leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI infrastructure, Modal enables developers to run demanding AI workloads—such as model training, fine-tuning, and large-scale batch processing—without sweating the details of managing infrastructure and higher-level tooling.

In this conversation, Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, sat down with Modal chief executive officer, Erik Bernhardsson—who previously led engineering teams at Spotify building its music recommendation system—to discuss the challenges of AI infrastructure, why Modal chose OCI, and what’s next for AI development at scale.

Thiagarajan: Could you give us a little background on Modal and what problems you’re solving?

Bernhardsson: Modal is a serverless platform for AI, ML, and data developers. We make it easy to build and scale AI workloads in the cloud without dealing with the infrastructure headaches. Our focus is on making it easy to build applications and run AI workloads in the cloud. A lot of our work stems from frustration with existing platforms and tools, and the developer experience. Scaling AI infrastructure is hard—provisioning GPUs, managing containers, handling networking—so we built a platform where developers don’t have to think about any of that. Instead of spending weeks setting up infrastructure, they can just write code and deploy it instantly.

Thiagarajan: As a startup, what are your top challenges—tech, hiring, funding?

Bernhardsson: Hiring and growth. Right now, capital isn’t a bottleneck for us—it’s about supporting our customers and bringing in the right people to scale effectively. I’ve worked at startups for my whole career, 15-20 years—the core thing is your people and who you hire. Hire scrappy, commercially minded, smart people, and you’re 80% of the way there.

Thiagarajan: On the business side, what are some of the problems Modal is solving?

Bernhardsson: Customers want to focus on what they’re good at, which is training models or building great consumer experiences, while we handle all the scaling, infrastructure management, provisioning, and containerization. Take one of our customers, Suno. Instead of hiring a massive team to manage their infrastructure, they use Modal. We handle the compute, the scaling, and the deployment, so they can focus on their core product. Our biggest value proposition to customers is that their engineers can move faster with Modal. They don’t have to build and maintain their own platform or worry about capacity planning. With Modal, developers who are using generative AI to create new applications, such as those used to compose music or design novel protein structures, can access a platform that delivers fast and reliable GPUs. With Modal using OCI AI infrastructure, developers building on Modal can ship code, get their data and AI models into production, and test applications much faster. Customers, especially AI startups also love our serverless business and pricing model that makes it easy for them to get started with a small team and build something really cool without breaking the bank.

Thiagarajan: Can you share details about why you chose OCI and how its helping Modal solve problems for customers?

Bernhardsson: We’ve been very impressed with the hardware and the fact that Oracle offers bare metal instances, along with super-fast networking, disk and CPUs, and then the GPUs themselves, of course. OCI’s bare metal instances have been phenomenal at delivering value for our customers. We can provide the capacity our customers need, often with very short lead times. But beyond that, the agility of Oracle’s sales process has been a game changer. If I need to do a large scale out of my GPU environment, I can literally text someone and get them provisioned quickly. That kind of flexibility and partnership is rare.

Thiagarajan: AI infrastructure is getting crowded. How do you see the market? Where does OCI fit in, and how do you differentiate?

Bernhardsson: I think what Oracle is doing extremely well is managing the hardware, the compute, the data centers, and doing that at a massive scale. Modal, on the other hand, is focused on the developer experience. We provide a serverless platform with clean APIs, Python SDKs, and instant execution. It’s a different part of the stack. There’s plenty of room for multiple players in this space. OCI AI infrastructure provides the raw power, and we make it easy for developers to access and scale it without friction.

Thiagarajan: Everyone’s talking about AI, but what’s underreported or overlooked?

Bernhardsson: I think audio and music are interesting. Historically, music tech has often been ahead of the curve—whether it was the gramophone, MP3s, or music streaming. Big shifts in technology tend to show up in music before spreading to other areas. We’ve seen a lot of AI applications already, but I still feel like we’re very early in understanding where this is all going. Fast forward 10 or 20 years and I think AI-generated music and audio will be far beyond where we are today. It’s exciting to watch because I think there’s a lot of untapped potential that people aren’t talking about as much as other AI breakthroughs.

Thiagarajan: What broader AI trends do you find interesting?

Bernhardsson: One of the most exciting shifts is the realization that AI breakthroughs don’t have to rely on massive compute budgets. It’s been a little frustrating for me as someone with a math, computer science, and physics background because I want to believe in small, lean, scrappy teams solving very hard problems. Major breakthroughs weren’t capital-limited—they were driven by lean teams making clever innovations. A small, smart team that’s focused can also make a lot of progress. If AI is going to break through and change this world, we need it to be available to small teams. There are very few technological breakthroughs in the past where capital was the limiting factor, right? It’s often small teams with innovative, clever applications that drive things.

Thiagarajan: I think the point you’re illustrating is that continuous innovation can mean finding creative ways to use hardware to get the same outcome a lot more efficiently, right?

Bernhardsson: Exactly. We’re going to see a major shift toward efficiency in AI infrastructure. If we look back 15 or even 10 years ago, you didn’t need a billion dollars to make a breakthrough. But now you need it. Over the next 10–15 years, I expect AI training costs to drop by orders of magnitude as we refine models, improve algorithms, and develop efficient hardware. We still have a long way to go, and AI training is wildly inefficient compared to the human brain. There’s so much room for improvement, and that’s where the next wave of innovation will come from.

Behind the glamour of innovation, it all comes down to making a better way of living, and that “living” supposedly reaches beyond humankind. Coral reefs have been suffering from the destruction of the marine ecosystem with climate change, pollutants, and overharvesting. Archireef, which came along in 2020, is pioneering the restoration.



Founded in Hong Kong, Archireef introduced a new use for terracotta clay and made the world’s first 3D-printed Reef Tiles™ that gives a chance to hold off the damage and wins championship in the Elevator Pitch Competition (EPIC) 2021.



Last year alone, EPIC put over 600 entries of international innovators from 47 economies in one spot, as the largest tech event in Hong Kong, it’s destined for “growth” to soar from there.



Since then, widespread recognition has brought Archireef to the Middle Eastern coast, with backing from Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) secured, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the region, the partnership has not only meant capital but has also large-scale production of end-to-end eco-engineering solutions is able to steer the company towards global expansion in marine conservation and managing nature risks in the oceans.

That explains the growing client base of the nature-risk management company, local and international corporations including Swire Bulk, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), AD Ports Group, Sino Group and Chow Sang Sang, all contributing to climate resilience and biodiversity recovery in mitigating long-term risks and costs.

Digital Health Tech Potential in Applying to be Physicians Assistants

Imagine a group of data scientists huddled over in Silicon Valley and come up with yet another adaptation of AI – pretty much how Leapstack was founded back in 2016. By leveraging AI and machine learning, its platform can be trained to analyze claimant data and provide personalized recommendations, insurers across countries are able to streamline claim processes and optimize policies.



“We aspired to become to go-to for health insurance players around the world.” Cole Gu, Co-founder and CEO of Leapstack says, fully aware of the obstacles where Insurtech is not a one-size-fit-all with risk scenarios, compliance and regulatory vary from country to country.



A eureka moment doesn’t guarantee success if it lacks investment opportunities or partnership support – exactly what EPIC offers, to put the misery to the often dire situation for startups to get their ideas off the ground.



“Once the match between startups and their support system hit it off, it’s all smooth sailing from there.” would be outright a dream too good to be true. Following Leapstack’s participation in EPIC 2023 all the way to the semifinals, they’ve continued evolving into a leading digital healthcare platform in Asia with a strong presence in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, and its origin, Mainland China, going from mere coverage in Shanghai, to taking on nearly one-third of social medical insurance fund monitoring projects in the market, had them becoming a trusted service provider for claim management systems of top-tier international health insurers including Manulife and AIA in the Chinese society, leveraging cutting-edge AI to reshape the health insurance value chain and connect stakeholders.



That earned more than a ticket but an invitation from HKSTP to join its Elite programme, exclusive for those that show potential to head for global markets, the three-year milestone-based funding initiative consist of expert guidance, funding support, as well as comprehensive go-to-market strategies for more, according to Gu, “a presence in the Hong Kong market itself is a defining moment for us. We’re drawn to Hong Kong’s sound regulatory environment and strong global reputation in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Use cases that can be easier in adapting to other emerging markets also helped making this rather easy call operating in Hong Kong.”



Not to mention that Hong Kong boasts the highest global insurance penetration rate and the second-highest insurance density, solidifying its position as an Insurtech innovation hub, despite its relatively small population of 7.5 million.



Leapstack also embarked on another rewarding international journey led by HKSTP, “In January, we participated in the ‘Think Business, Think Hong Kong’ event in Jakarta, Indonesia to explore opportunities across Asia, ” notes Gu on his observations, “Customers in emerging markets are increasingly aware of their health protection gaps and purchasing coverage as a result.” and prior to that, Leapstack joined the delegation visiting the UAE last year to meet with local technical partners, industry leaders and regulatory bodies, extending the experience of international support.

Epic Traction for Tech and Talent

These inspiring stories are part of the reason EPIC kept going and announced its 9th edition will be competing for an investment pool of 100 million and cash prize of $240,000 in three tech tracks – Digital Health Tech, Green Tech, FinTech. A global open call for innovators has just appeared on the radar, and finalists from all corners will be flown to cruise terminal in Hong Kong for the finale to unfold in November.



Not just any competition. essence of the event is to break something, of borders, of sectors, of limits – if past years were any indication, anticipation for outreaching overseas should only build from now on for EPIC 2025, open calling global registration until 17 June 2025, 23:59 (GMT +8) – it’s about time to make your own EPIC story, visit epic.hkstp.org to learn more.

https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/google-cloud/google-clouds-future-of-ai-perspectives-for-startups-23-ai-leaders-one-report/,"Startups are leading the generative AI charge by experimenting with new applications across industries, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, and advancing the technology’s potential. They are the engine of gen AI innovation in a rapidly evolving landscape. Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO, Social Capital: “I think AI is more than just an ongoing shift: it’s a hyper-disruption. The traditional software industry, with its complex products, high cost, balkanized features, and licensing models, is being completely reimagined.”

We asked 23 industry leaders and investors their perspective on the most critical AI and Cloud AI innovations, trends, opportunities and challenges that startup leaders need to be aware of in 2025 and beyond in Google Cloud’s Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups 2025 report.

The evolving role of AI agents in business

Among the trends discussed, AI agents were the leading topic of conversation. The growing innovation of AI leaders with agents comes as no surprise, but their collective vision of how these agentic systems will evolve reveals an intriguing perspective on the increasingly sophisticated interactions we’ll soon encounter and their business implications.

The opportunities seem quite expansive. For example, Matthieu Rouif, Co-Founder and CEO, Photoroom, emphasizes AI becoming increasingly adept at recognizing and responding to human emotions; this could enable AI systems to tailor content and experiences to individual emotional responses in ways that create more meaningful connections. According to Harrison Chase, CEO and Co-Founder, LangChain; “To truly leverage agentic systems, I want them to scale beyond just what I can ask them to do– to be ‘ambient agents,’ running in the background, always on, monitoring streams of events, and alerting me only when something interesting happens or when they need my help.” Such intelligence and deep personalization could transform customer experience and business relationships, marking a significant evolution from today’s task-oriented AI to tomorrow’s empathetic digital companions.

Besides the impact on customer experience, according to Jennifer Li, General Partner, a16z, AI agents are also transforming the developer experience. “ Coding has turned out to be one of the most mature spaces in AI because it has more easily verifiable results and a fast feedback loop. You can check if the results are correct, and there’s already a lot of tooling, from testing to validation, to help figure out if the model has performed the way you want. It can be as simple as autocomplete or as involved as an agent building a full blown app.”

Rethinking AI infrastructure for the next generation

Yet for all the amazing leaps AI is offering, almost none of it would be possible without the right infrastructure, which is another major focus topic.

“Tight synchronization and massive compute requirements push infrastructure to never-seen-before levels of compute density and capability,” said Amin Vahdat, VP & GM for Systems and Cloud AI, Google Cloud.

The future infrastructure landscape will likely be characterized by modular architectures that combine smaller, specialized models across different data modalities, supported by sophisticated orchestration and observability layers. Mayada Gonimah, CTO & Co-Founder, Thread AI, highlights that: “Integrations and infrastructure for observable workflow management will become even more critical parts of the AI stack. Companies will need interfaces that let them insert AI in their existing workflows and test them in parallel to existing processes. I think being more intentional around where you embed AI and having the tooling around observability is going to be key moving forward as we build these production-worthy AI-native workflows.”

Infrastructure efficiency will become a critical competitive differentiator, with organizations that achieve twice the efficiency gaining significant market advantages. Arvind Jain, CEO, Glean, emphasizes the importance of designing your infrastructure to be more agnostic to model and tooling advancements. “Predict what’s coming and enable plug-and-play where feasible to take advantage of updates without massive overhauls or disruptions.”



Cloud providers will continue to play a central role, but successful organizations will build flexible systems that can seamlessly integrate new models and technologies. For a deep dive around impactful trends like multimodal AI, customer experience, enterprise search, and more technical advancements, check out the full report.

Areas investors are prioritizing for AI startups in 2025

The AI investors in the report are zeroing in on startups that deliver concrete solutions to real-world challenges, moving beyond the initial AI hype. Salim Teja, Partner, Radical Ventures, is focused on startups that use AI to address real problems such as improving health, fighting diseases, combating climate change, and addressing the affordable housing crisis through robotics in construction.

Having data alone isn’t enough — investors want to see strategic use of high-quality, secure data that enhances AI performance in specific applications. Venture capitalists are particularly drawn to solutions that boost productivity and transform business operations, especially in developer tools. Raviraj Jain, Partner, Lightspeed, points out that “all organizations have to think like VCs (Venture Capitalists)—even though you’re beholden to quarterly results, you still have to think five to ten years ahead and how your organization and market structure will change, and how critical it will be to leverage AI as part of that change.”

The winning formula? A clear competitive edge, path to profitability, and deep integration into user workflows. According to Crystal Huang, General Partner, GV, “if your product is easy to implement, it’s just as easy to uninstall. Products need to be stickier to create lasting value, which means being both indispensable and deeply integrated into the user’s workflow.”

Leapfrog the competition and create a defensible position

In today’s competitive AI landscape, building a defensible market position requires a sophisticated strategy that goes beyond simply implementing the latest models.



David Friedberg, CEO, Ohalo Genetics, put it this way: “If you’re just an LLM wrapper, it’s going to be hard to build a sustainable business — you’re likely going to get commoditized away. Businesses need an engine of value creation that persists with an initial advantaged offering with continuous improvements. This will typically come from proprietary data generation, which is used to continuously improve model performance, or network effects that lock-in access to data or customers.”

Douwe Kiela, CEO, Contextual AI highlights the need for speed and focus in the AI market. “Move fast. Time to market is the most important thing for a startup, and the market is now. Things are moving incredibly fast in AI, so you have to make sure you’re not left behind.”

Staying ahead of the competition is not just about the technology. How AI companies monetize and sell their AI is as important as how they build it. As Jerry Chen, Partner, Greylock, states “your competition is no longer against the incumbent, it is against the incumbent’s business model.”

Looking ahead

The breakneck pace of change being driven by generative AI means that startups are facing unprecedented challenges. At Google Cloud, we’re collaborating with researchers, founders, startups, investors, enterprises, partners, and public sector agencies to think critically about how our responsible AI solutions can meet the needs of employees, customers, patients, and citizens.

Our hope is that the Future of AI: Perspectives for Startups 2025 report will shed more light on one of the fastest-moving technologies our industry has ever seen — and in particular, provide exciting guidance to founders who are imagining the next wave of innovative AI startups.

If you’re a GTM leader shaping Software, apply now. Know someone brilliant driving Growth? Nominate them today.

GTM: The Make-or-Break Factor

The idea that “if you build it, they will come” has been dead for a while. The best product doesn’t always win – the best GTM strategy does.

Take Figma. It didn’t just build a collaborative design tool; it engineered a viral adoption loop, fueling organic growth that led to its $12.5 billion valuation. HubSpot transformed the way companies think about marketing by executing a category-defining inbound strategy, creating a movement that turned customers into evangelists. And Notion mastered community-led growth, leveraging user enthusiasm to scale faster than traditional enterprise sales ever could.

But while their products are praised, the GTM strategies that propelled them remain an afterthought. In reality, the ability to execute a winning GTM playbook is one of the hardest – and most valuable skills in Software. And the numbers back it up.

A study by OpenView and High Alpha found that 76% of startup founders rank GTM execution as their biggest challenge – outranking product development and cash flow concerns. Another report by Forbes highlights that 50% of startups fail within five years because they struggle to reach and convert customers. Research from Simon-Kucher reveals that “companies with well-defined ideal customer profiles (ICP) see a 68% higher win rate” than those without it.

The GTM10 Awards: A First-of-Its-Kind Recognition

https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/incode/deepfakes-on-demand-welcome-to-the-era-of-fraud-as-a-service-faas/,"By Ricardo Amper



The digital revolution has reshaped industries and everyday life, unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Yet, beneath its promise lies a growing menace: critical vulnerabilities that threaten the very systems we rely on. When systems falter—from financial networks that underpin economies to public services essential to daily activities—the resulting chaos ripples across societies, disrupting businesses, eroding trust, and endangering livelihoods.

Enter “Fraud as a Service” (FaaS), a sinister twist on the “Software as a Service” (SaaS) model that has revolutionized legitimate industries. Fueled by deepfake technology and scalable tools, FaaS has proliferated on the dark web, evolving

into accessible and affordable platforms. These platforms target and exploit our digital lifelines, amplifying fraud to an unprecedented heights.

Cybercriminals no longer need sophisticated tools or advanced technical expertise to execute disruptive illegal activities. The barriers to accessing AI and deepfake devices have virtually disappeared—they are now just a few clicks away.

Multiple reports reveal an alarming surge in fraudulent incidents within the fintech industry, with increases of several hundred percent in 2023, highlighting the growing scale and accessibility of these schemes.

FaaS platforms offer generative AI-powered fraud services through subscription like models, enabling even non-technical users to deploy realistic voice, video, and image manipulations. For as little as $20, anyone can impersonate executives, forge identities, or create convincing videos to bypass security protocols.

This isn’t just fraud—it’s fraud at an industrial scale. A single individual can now target thousands of employees simultaneously. In short, welcome to the democratization of fraud.

Fighting Back in the New Digital Age

Despite the bleak outlook, the battle against fraud in this digital era is far from hopeless. While traditional security systems—such as passwords, knowledge based authentication, and basic biometric checks—are proving increasingly inadequate, multi-layered approaches are emerging as robust solutions to these growing threats and problems.

Fraudsters can exploit outdated technologies to bypass identity checks that rely solely on static images or voice recordings. However, innovative solutions, such as advanced biometric technologies paired with comprehensive fraud detection systems, are rendering such practices ineffective.

At Incode, the company I co-founded nearly a decade ago, we developed a wide-ranging variety of tools that not only verify identities but also actively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent users, eliminating digital vulnerabilities at their source.

Some of the key solutions we offer to prevent and detect fraudulent activities include:

Advanced Personhood Detection: Real-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks.

Real-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks. Streamlined Integration: A frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions.

A frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions. Continuous Identity Monitoring: AI-driven monitoring tracks and highlights suspicious identity signals across interactions, enabling proactive defenses against generative AI threats.

These technologies allow organizations to build a robust ecosystem capable of combating the evolving tactics of fraudsters, securing digital systems, and restoring trust in the digital age.

The once-reliable multi-factor authentication (MFA) system, a cornerstone of modern security, is increasingly inadequate against sophisticated attacks. AI has significantly undermined its effectiveness; by mimicking vocal patterns or generating lifelike images, attackers can easily bypass MFA, making social engineering attacks more prevalent than ever. Meanwhile, physical identification methods, such as ID documents, are equally vulnerable to digital manipulation.

In short, most traditional security systems are no match for the new capabilities of generative AI.

To combat these advanced threats, Incode’s cutting-edge technology provides the robust solutions organizations are seeking to safeguard their operations. Our tools address these vulnerabilities head-on, offering reliable protection against the costly, disruptive consequences of AI-driven fraud.

Financial Sector: A Canary in the Coal Mine

Banks and financial institutions are on the frontlines of this battle. In 2024, a Hong Kong firm lost $25 million after an employee fell victim to a deepfake video impersonating their CFO. This was not an isolated incident; many such cases remain unreported. Generative AI’s ability to produce hyper-realistic content has made it an ideal weapon for fraudsters.

According to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, AI-enabled fraud losses are projected to grow to $40 billion in 2027, from $12.3 billion in 2023 –or more than quadruple its estimated current cost. The financial sector’s reliance on identity verification, trust, and authenticity makes it uniquely vulnerable to such threats, necessitating a robust response.

Incode Workforce: Protecting Organizations at Scale

Our Incode Workforce platform exemplifies a multi-layered approach. Designed to secure access at every stage of the employee lifecycle, it enhances Identity Access Management Systems (IAM), integrating advanced personhood detection, seamless biometric verification, and fraud detection. Whether onboarding remote employees or safeguarding sensitive operations, Incode Workforce ensures that only verified, living individuals interact with your business systems and assets.

In partnership with Okta, the leading independent Identity partner that frees everyone to safely use any technology, we’ve even extended our capabilities to enable organizations to securely verify the “real world identity” of who they’re interacting with.

The Incode-Okta Workforce Identity integration strengthens security for high-risk scenarios such as:

Identity Verification at MFA Enrollment: . Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment.

. Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment. Help Desk and Account Recovery: Minimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets.

Minimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets. Step-Up Verification for Critical Workflows: Secure high-value transactions through our biometric verification, protect sensitive data access, and more.

“As a security practitioner, I see Incode’s partnership with Okta as a pivotal step in addressing emerging threats like AI-driven fraud. The combination of biometric verification with robust IAM capabilities ensures a higher standard of security for enterprises navigating today’s complex risk landscape,” said Mukund Sarma, Security Lead at Chime.

Keeping Pace: Accelerating Fraud Prevention

As FaaS continues to evolve, fraud is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Defenses must keep up. By investing in advanced biometric systems and adopting proactive, multi-layered defense strategies, organizations can stay ahead of these escalating challenges.

Incode’s recognition as a Leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Identity Verification highlights our commitment to innovation and excellence in addressing these critical issues.

By: Jeff Chan, Senior Manager, Enterprise Innovation, TD Bank Group

The question every organization asks: what will consumers want next? As consumer expectations evolve, organizations must be better able to anticipate these shifts to stay ahead. How do we do that? For starters, understanding and applying consumer trends as part of decision making can increase confidence that an idea will resonate with modern consumers. These trends are not predictions or definitive answers. Instead, they may help innovative organizations ask different questions when brainstorming the next great experience. Here are three emerging trends to consider:

Trust and Transparency goes both ways

“Is this real?” This question is becoming more common when customers receive an electronic communication from their financial institution. As technology blurs the line between authenticity and deception, trust must be a core focus. The rise of low-cost Generative AI tools can have both a positive impact for good businesses and usher us into a new era of concern when it is in the hands of bad actors. Scams and fake content have become so prevalent that consumers are being pushed to go directly to the source for truth. As such, banks not only need to continue protecting their services, but also need to prove to consumers that they are who they say they are. One example of this type of service are the AI-powered anti-scam measures introduced by Commonwealth Bank in Australia. The result? Customer scam losses were cut in half. Some have features to re-assure customers they are, in fact, talking to their bank. For example, Barclays in the United Kingdom introduced an in-app call verification feature to help confirm that an inbound call from them was legitimate. In January, Revolut, a leading global fintech, rolled out in-app calls to their customers. The purpose of this new security measure helps customers know that Revolut will only call them through the app, which allows them to more easily identify potential impersonation scams via traditional phone lines.

Seeking balance in a digital world

Many consumers are growing weary of a digital-first lifestyle and yearn for balance. Accenture’s 2025 Life Trends Report found that 42% of global respondents said, “their most enjoyable experience in the previous week was a physical one, while only 15% said it was digital”. To me the data suggests that consumers could be seeking balance, perhaps using tools that take care of repetitive tasks so they can free up much needed time for real-life experiences. In the future, as consumer adoption increases with smarter AI, it could mean adopting AI to help make certain decisions on consumers’ behalf. For financial services, this could mean introducing a true hybrid human/AI experience where intelligent virtual assistants, powered by agentic AI, could perform tasks that include optimizing a client’s trading portfolio to executing trades on their behalf. By doing so, the AI frees up a client’s time so they can spend more time connecting with their financial advisor to better understand additional needs that only a human can.

Navigating the unknown

In 2022, Collins Dictionary declared ‘permacrisis’ the Word of The Year. The term reflected an extended period of instability and insecurity. With so much uncertainty, could consumers be looking for help navigating a chaotic world with greater confidence? Generative AI could play an important role in giving banks predictive capabilities that could help their customers map out multiple financial scenarios to help make better choices. Today’s personalization efforts, looking at key transactional or web browsing attributes, may give way to more advanced ‘digital twins’, once only accessible to big tech, to reshape decision making. In a world of new possibilities, we could imagine a model is trained against a client’s persona to better predict how external forces and anticipated decision making could alter their financial future.

These trends are not full answers to where industries could go next. They can help us ask better questions, so our colleagues land at an idea that could set us up for success. Our people play a critical role in helping TD transform.

Through TD Invent, the Bank’s approach to innovation, we are encouraged to imagine the art of the possible and bring it to life through specialized processes. Our recent Gen AI virtual assistant to support our Canadian Contact Centre and virtual reality training pilot in branches were developed through the TD Invent approach.

We believe the possibilities are endless. The trust our TD customers place in us is central to our innovation philosophy, and our goal is to drive positive outcomes for our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve, that are fair, safe and transparent.

By Lee Ott, Vice President of AI Products, HP

At the heart of AI is the goal of elevating human potential. When technology manages mundane or repetitive tasks, we are free to focus on creativity, collaboration, and decision-making. By offloading routine tasks to AI, workflows that once took days can be completed in hours, enabling people to think bigger and move faster.

This shift from purely transactional tools to truly human-centric experiences underscores a core truth: One of technology’s most powerful purposes is to empower individuals, and by extension enterprises, while ensuring ethical, secure, and responsible innovation. AI’s real value lies in its ability to unlock new levels of productivity, spark innovation and drive responsible, human-centered progress.

Building for an AI-Native World

Traditionally, we learned to adapt to technology – memorizing arcane shortcuts and slogging through manual processes. In the AI-native era, we’re reversing that relationship. Today’s products are designed to adapt to us, understanding our workflows and preferences so seamlessly that we hardly notice the tech behind the scenes.

At HP, we’re evolving our hardware and software to ensure AI is embedded in a way that feels intuitive – enhancing what you do without adding friction. This includes everything from specialized chips for real-time processing to AI-driven applications that streamline everyday tasks.

Quantization and the Rise of Local AI

One of the most exciting developments in driving on-device AI is quantization. By reducing model size we can achieve near-instant responses without going to the cloud for everything. This leads to:

Lower Cost : Smaller models are more efficient, reducing both infrastructure and energy expenses.

: Smaller models are more efficient, reducing both infrastructure and energy expenses. Enhanced Privacy : Sensitive data stays on your device, which is crucial for regulated industries or personal information.

: Sensitive data stays on your device, which is crucial for regulated industries or personal information. Better User Experience: Local processing eliminates lag, resulting in real-time responsiveness for tasks like audio/video enhancements or instant translations.

Meanwhile, new silicon architectures are emerging to accommodate these streamlined models, allowing even mainstream PCs to deliver impressive AI performance at the edge.

From Models to Agents

For years, the conversation centered on building better models. Now, the focus is on agents – AI entities that proactively handle tasks for you. Instead of manually typing a prompt into a chatbot, you might imagine a PC that recognizes you’re in the middle of a project, automatically organizes your notes, sets calendar reminders, or drafts emails in the background.

Why AI Matters

Proactive Assistance : An AI PC will increasingly go beyond answering queries. It will assist users by intelligently anticipating needs, while reducing the steps needed for common workflows – always keeping the user in control of final decisions and actions.

: An AI PC will increasingly go beyond answering queries. It will assist users by intelligently anticipating needs, while reducing the steps needed for common workflows – always keeping the user in control of final decisions and actions. Contextual Awareness : By securely tapping local data – like your files or environment sensors – your PC will be able to act with an intimate understanding of your context. This ensures it is both helpful and highly personalized.

This ensures it is both helpful and highly personalized. Frictionless Productivity: From summarizing meeting transcripts to scheduling follow–ups, the user experience feels less like “using a computer” and more like collaborating with a capable partner.

Real-World Applications: AI PCs in Action

Seamless Collaboration

Tasks like background blur, live gesture detection, and real-time subtitles can all run locally, ensuring crisp video and audio while reducing latency. In a global call, you might be conversing in multiple languages with near–instant translation on your end.

Privacy–Sensitive Environments

Enterprise clients often deal with proprietary documents or employee data. Running specialized local models lets them reap the benefits of AI – like document summarization or note-taking – without risking data exposure to the public cloud.

Towards Hybrid Compute: Local and Cloud

While on-device AI continues to grow more capable – thanks to quantization and specialized silicon – there are times when you need broader, more intensive analysis. That’s where hybrid comes into play.

Rather than funneling all tasks through a single engine, AI-native products will leverage a flexible pipeline, ensuring that users have visibility and control over when tasks remain local and when cloud resources are securely utilized:

Local, Real-Time Tasks : Anything requiring instant response or heavy privacy – like filtering a live video feed – can run on–device.

: Anything requiring instant response or heavy privacy – like filtering a live video feed – can run on–device. Adaptive Cloud Offload: Larger or more complex analyses can be shifted seamlessly to the cloud (or on-prem devices) when needed, taking advantage of scalable compute resources.

This hybrid strategy optimizes performance, privacy, and cost. For example, you might do quick classification or summarization locally, then tap into more extensive cloud-based inference for deeper reasoning.

Overcoming Challenges Through Responsible Innovation

AI, especially when it’s proactive, brings its share of concerns – from privacy to transparency. At HP, our goal is not only to offer cutting-edge features but also to ensure they are grounded in trust and responsible design.

User Control : You decide what data is processed locally, when it goes to the cloud, and who has access. Clear toggles and settings put power in the hands of end users.

: You decide what data is processed locally, when it goes to the cloud, and who has access. Clear toggles and settings put power in the hands of end users. Transparent Data Practices : We design our products so you know what’s happening with your data. Whether it’s an on-device agent or a hybrid workflow, you have visibility and choice.

: We design our products so you know what’s happening with your data. Whether it’s an on-device agent or a hybrid workflow, you have visibility and choice. Regulatory Alignment: As regulations evolve, our hardware and software strategies evolve, too. By prioritizing secure enclaves, encryption, and compliance standards, we’re shaping AI systems that meet enterprise and consumer needs alike.

Looking Ahead: Designing AI for Humanity

As AI advances from passive models to agentic, ever-present partners, the goal remains clear: human augmentation. By freeing individuals from repetitive tasks and enabling them to focus on what truly matters, AI has the potential to transform everyday life and work.

Our focus at HP is to create AI-native products that intuitively adapt to you – tapping into local intelligence for speed and privacy, while harnessing elastic compute for scale. In this future, the question isn’t just “what can AI do?” but “how can AI seamlessly amplify the best of what you do?”

The more we embrace these shifts – quantization at the edge, agentic interfaces, and flexible hybrid architectures – the closer we get to AI that feels as natural as any other aspect of our world. And that, ultimately, is how technology becomes truly human-centric: by meeting us where we are, helping us grow, and making room for the creativity, connections, and innovations that only people can bring.

Don’t wait to join the AI Era. Meet the next generation of HP AI PCs, and experience more meaningful moments with AI solutions that adapt to you.",Technology
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250612001244.htm,"A new study from Toho University reveals that female earwigs exhibit a similar pattern of exaggerated forceps growth as males, suggesting that both sexes may have evolved these traits through sexual selection.

Do larger male elk have proportionally larger antlers? The answer is no. In fact, larger individuals tend to have disproportionately larger antlers -- a phenomenon known as positive allometry. This pattern, where certain body parts grow disproportionately large relative to body size, is observed not only in mammals but also in animals such as beetles and fiddler crabs. Evolutionary biologists interpret such traits as evidence of sexual selection -- a process in which physical features evolve because they offer an advantage in competing for mates.

Male earwigs are known to show positive allometry in their forceps -- pincer-like appendages at the tip of the abdomen -- which are believed to have evolved as weapons in battles with rivals. But what about females? Female earwigs also have forceps -- so what purpose do they serve?

Tomoki Matsuzawa (then an undergraduate) and Associate Professor Junji Konuma from Toho University's Department of Biology conducted the first quantitative study of female earwig forceps. Using morphometric analysis on the maritime earwigs Anisolabis maritima, they found that female forceps also display positive allometry -- suggesting that they, too, may have evolved through sexual selection.

The team measured the head, thorax, abdomen, and bilateral forceps dimensions and analyzed shape differences in both sexes. They found that males have thick, short, and curved forceps, while females have thin, long, and straight ones -- indicating clear sexual dimorphism. When they plotted body size against forceps width and length on a log-log scale, the results revealed a pattern of positive allometry in males: forceps width increased disproportionately with body size. Surprisingly, positive allometry was also found in females -- in the length of the forceps. These results suggest that while the sexes differ in forceps shape, both may have evolved them as weapons -- albeit in different ways.

Associate Professor Konuma explains:""A previous behavioral study has shown that female earwigs compete for small, non-aggressive males. Our findings suggest that female forceps may have evolved as effective weapons in such competition. While most earlier research focused only on males, our study highlights the importance of considering female traits as well when studying the evolution of insect morphologies.""

These findings were published on June 12, 2025, in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.",Science

These images, shared at a press event Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, illustrate the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, is not a homogenous, steady flow of material, but an area with sputtering gusts of hot plasma.

These images, shared at a press event Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, illustrate the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, is not a homogenous, steady flow of material, but an area with sputtering gusts of hot plasma. These images will help scientists improve their understanding of how the Sun impacts Earth and our technology in space.

""We really never had the ability to do this kind of science before,"" said Jeffrey Newmark, a heliophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the principal investigator for CODEX. ""The right kind of filters, the right size instrumentation -- all the right things fell into place. These are brand new observations that have never been seen before, and we think there's a lot of really interesting science to be done with it.""

NASA's CODEX is a solar coronagraph, an instrument often employed to study the Sun's faint corona, or outer atmosphere, by blocking the bright face of the Sun. The instrument, which is installed on the International Space Station, creates artificial eclipses using a series of circular pieces of material called occulting disks at the end of a long telescope-like tube. The occulting disks are about the size of a tennis ball and are held in place by three metal arms.

Scientists often use coronagraphs to study visible light from the corona, revealing dynamic features, such as solar storms, that shape the weather in space, potentially impacting Earth and beyond.

""The CODEX instrument is doing something new,"" said Newmark. ""Previous coronagraph experiments have measured the density of material in the corona, but CODEX is measuring the temperature and speed of material in the slowly varying solar wind flowing out from the Sun.""

These new measurements allow scientists to better characterize the energy at the source of the solar wind.

The CODEX instrument uses four narrow-band filters -- two for temperature and two for speed -- to capture solar wind data. ""By comparing the brightness of the images in each of these filters, we can tell the temperature and speed of the coronal solar wind,"" said Newmark.

Understanding the speed and temperature of the solar wind helps scientists build a more accurate picture of the Sun, which is necessary for modeling and predicting the Sun's behaviors.

""The CODEX instrument will impact space weather modeling by providing constraints for modelers to use in the future,"" said Newmark. ""We're excited for what's to come.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611085304.htm,"Star TOI-6894 is just like many in our galaxy, a small red dwarf, and only ~20% of the mass of our Sun. Like many small stars, it is not expected to provide suitable conditions for the formation and hosting of a large planet.

However, as published today in Nature Astronomy, an international team of astronomers have found the unmistakable signature of a giant planet, called TOI-6894b, orbiting this tiny star.

This system has been discovered as part of a large-scale investigation of TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) data, looking for giant planets around low-mass stars, led by Dr. Edward Bryant, who completed this work at The University of Warwick and at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory.

Dr. Edward Bryant, Warwick Astrophysics Prize Fellow and first author said: ""I was very excited by this discovery. I originally searched through TESS observations of more than 91,000 low-mass red-dwarf stars looking for giant planets.

""Then, using observations taken with one of the world's largest telescopes, ESO's VLT, I discovered TOI-6894b, a giant planet transiting the lowest mass star known to date to host such a planet. We did not expect planets like TOI-6894b to be able to form around stars this low-mass. This discovery will be a cornerstone for understanding the extremes of giant planet formation.""

The planet (TOI-6894b) is a low-density gas giant with a radius a little larger than Saturn's but with only ~50% of Saturn's mass. The star (TOI-6894) is the lowest mass star to have a transiting giant planet discovered to date and is just 60% the size of the next smallest star to host such a planet.

Dr. Daniel Bayliss, Associate Professor at The University of Warwick said: ""Most stars in our Galaxy are actually small stars exactly like this, with low masses and previously thought to not be able to host gas giant planets. So, the fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our Galaxy.""

A Challenge to the Leading Theory

Dr Vincent Van Eylen, from UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: ""It's an intriguing discovery. We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet! This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.""

The most widely held theory of planet formation is called the core accretion theory. A planetary core forms first through accretion (gradual accumulation of material) and as the core becomes more massive, it eventually attracts gases that form an atmosphere. It then gets massive enough to enter a runaway gas accretion process to become a gas giant.

In this theory, the formation of gas giants is harder around low-mass stars because the amount of gas and dust in a protoplanetary disc around the star (the raw material of planet formation) is too limited to allow a massive enough core to form, and the runaway process to occur.

Yet the existence of TOI-6894b (a giant planet orbiting an extremely low-mass star) suggests this model cannot be completely accurate and alternative theories are needed.

Edward added: ""Given the mass of the planet, TOI-6894b could have formed through an intermediate core-accretion process, in which a protoplanet forms and steadily accretes gas without the core becoming massive enough for runaway gas accretion.

""Alternatively, it could have formed because of a gravitationally unstable disc. In some cases, the disc surrounding the star will become unstable due to the gravitational force it exerts on itself. These discs can then fragment, with the gas and dust collapsing to form a planet.""

But the team found that neither theory could completely explain the formation of TOI-6894b from the available data, which leaves the origin of this giant planet as an open question for now.

One avenue to shed light on the mystery of TOI-6894b's formation is a detailed atmospheric analysis. By measuring the distribution of material within the planet, astronomers can determine the size and structure of the planet's core, which can tell us whether TOI-6894b formed via accretion or via an unstable disc.

This is not the only interesting feature of TOI-6894b's atmosphere; it is unusually cold for a gas giant. Most of the gas giants found by exoplanet hunters are hot Jupiters, massive gas giants with temperatures of ~1000-2000 Kelvin. TOI-6894b, by comparison, is just 420 Kelvin. The cool temperature alongside other features of this planet, such as the very deep transits, makes it one of the most promising giant planets for astronomers to characterise with a cool atmosphere.

Professor Amaury Triaud, University of Birmingham, co-author, and member of the SPECULOOS collaboration said: ""Based on the stellar irradiation of TOI-6894b, we expect the atmosphere is dominated by methane chemistry, which is exceedingly rare to identify. Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere.

""TOI-6894b likely presents a benchmark exoplanet for the study of methane-dominated atmospheres and the best 'laboratory' to study a planetary atmosphere containing carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen outside the Solar System.""

The atmosphere of TOI-6894b is already scheduled to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) within the next 12 months. This should allow astronomers to determine which, if either, of the possible theories can explain the formation of this unexpected planet.

Co-author Dr. Andrés Jordán, researcher at the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics and professor at Adolfo Ibáñez University, said: ""This system provides a new challenge for models of planet formation, and it offers a very interesting target for follow-up observations to characterize its atmosphere.

""This discovery is the result of a systematic program we have been carrying out for several years from Chile and the UK. Our efforts have allowed us to contribute significantly to a better understanding of how often small stars can form giant planets, and we are providing prime targets for follow-up with space-based platforms.""",Science

A sugar compound found in sea cucumbers can effectively block Sulf-2, an enzyme that plays a major role in cancer growth, according to a University of Mississippi-led study published in Glycobiology.

""Marine life produces compounds with unique structures that are often rare or not found in terrestrial vertebrates,"" said Marwa Farrag, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UM Department of BioMolecular Sciences.

""And so, the sugar compounds in sea cucumbers are unique. They aren't commonly seen in other organisms. That's why they're worth studying.""

Farrag, a native of Assiut, Egypt, and the study's lead author, worked with a team of researchers from Ole Miss and Georgetown University on the project.

Human cells, and those of most mammals, are covered in tiny, hairlike structures called glycans that help with cell communication, immune responses and the recognition of threats such as pathogens. Cancer cells alter the expression of certain enzymes, including Sulf-2, which in turn modifies the structure of glycans. This modification helps cancer spread.

""The cells in our body are essentially covered in 'forests' of glycans,"" said Vitor Pomin, associate professor of pharmacognosy. ""And enzymes change the function of this forest - essentially prunes the leaves of that forest.

""If we can inhibit that enzyme, theoretically, we are fighting against the spread of cancer.""

Using both computer modeling and laboratory testing, the research team found that the sugar - fucosylated chondroitin sulfate - from the sea cucumber Holothuria floridana can effectively inhibit Sulf-2.

""We were able to compare what we generated experimentally with what the simulation predicted, and they were consistent,"" said Robert Doerksen, professor of medicinal chemistry. ""That gives us more confidence in the results.""

Unlike other Sulf-2 regulating medications, the sea cucumber compound does not interfere with blood clotting, said Joshua Sharp, UM associate professor of pharmacology.

""As you can imagine, if you are treating a patient with a molecule that inhibits blood coagulation, then one of the adverse effects that can be pretty devastating is uncontrolled bleeding,"" he said. ""So, it's very promising that this particular molecule that we're working with doesn't have that effect.""

As a marine-based cancer therapy, the sea cucumber compound may be easier to create and safer to use.

""Some of these drugs we have been using for 100 years, but we're still isolating them from pigs because chemically synthesizing it would be very, very difficult and very expensive,"" Sharp said. ""That's why a natural source is really a preferred way to get at these carbohydrate-based drugs.""

Unlike extracting carbohydrate-based drugs from pigs or other land mammals, extracting the compound from sea cucumbers does not carry a risk of transferring viruses and other harmful agents, Pomin said.

""It's a more beneficial and cleaner resource,"" he said. ""The marine environment has many advantages compared to more traditional sources.""

But sea cucumbers - some variants of which are a culinary delicacy in the Pacific Rim - aren't so readily abundant that scientists could go out and harvest enough to create a line of medication. The next step in the research is to find a way to synthesize the sugar compound for future testing.

""One of the problems in developing this as a drug would be the low yield, because you can't get tons and tons of sea cucumbers,"" Pomin said. ""So, we have to have a chemical route, and when we've developed that, we can begin applying this to animal models.""

The interdisciplinary nature of the scientific study, which featured researchers from chemistry, pharmacognosy and computational biology, underscored the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in tackling complex diseases like cancer, Pomin said.

""This research took multiple expertise - mass spectrometry, biochemistry, enzyme inhibition, computation,"" Pomin said. ""It's the effort of the whole team.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611083736.htm,"Solar power is growing by leaps and bounds in the United States, propelled by climate mitigation policies and carbon-free energy goals -- and California is leading the way as the nation's top producer of solar electricity. A new study in Energy Strategy Reviews has revealed a dark side to the state's breakneck pace for solar investment, deployment, and adoption, taking a first-time look at patterns of public and private sector corruption in the California solar market.

Researchers at the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS) have identified seven distinct types of corruption abuses and risks in California solar energy. Among them, favoritism in project approvals, including a high-profile incident at the senior ranks of the U.S. Department of the Interior involving an intimate relationship with a solar company lobbyist. To fully realize a just energy transition, the authors call for major solar reforms in California as the U.S. increasingly relies on solar energy to decarbonize its electricity sector.

""It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior.""

""In this groundbreaking study, we find that efforts to accelerate solar infrastructure deployment in California end up contributing to a sobering array of corruption practices and risks. These include shocking abuses of power in the approval and licensing phases as well as the displacement of Indigenous groups, and also nefarious patterns of tax evasion or the falsification of information about solar projects,"" says lead author Benjamin Sovacool, who is the director of IGS and a Boston University professor of earth and environment. ""It's a wake-up call that the solar industry cannot continue on its current trajectory of bad governance and bad behavior.""

Drawing on a literature review and original interviews and fieldwork, the study's authors arrive at a framework that helps explore the wider socio-political realities driving corruption at a time of explosive growth in the California solar market, from 2010 to 2024. During this period, the state's solar energy production increased exponentially, reaching 79,544 gigawatt hours in 2024, or enough to power approximately 7.4 million U.S. households for a year, according to the State of Renewable Energy dashboard.

The research implicates solar energy in numerous corruption practices and risks that have adversely affected communities, policymaking and regulation, and siting decisions and planning.

""The most eye-opening finding for me is how common corruption is at every level of solar development, from small-scale vendors to high-level government officials, even in a well-regulated, progressive state like California,"" says co-author Alexander Dunlap, an IGS research fellow.

Favoritism and other forms of corruption

To understand how corruption undermines the solar market, the researchers focused on numerous utility-scale deployments in Riverside County, the fourth most populous county in California. They set out to document patterns of perceived corruption from a broad range of voices, gaining insights through organized focus groups and observation at different solar sites, as well as conducting interviews door-to-door and in a local supermarket parking lot. Respondents included residents in Blythe and Desert Center, California, impacted by solar energy development, solar construction workers, non-governmental organizations, solar company employees, federal agencies, and state and local governments.

While the study's authors acknowledge the difficulty of confirming individual claims of corruption, their mixed-methods research approach combines these personal assertions with analysis of news stories, court testimony, and other official sources to support their findings.

They point to a blend of public, private, social, and political patterns of corruption in the California solar energy market.

Clientelism and favoritism: Hiring friends or family over others for solar projects and unfairly allocating government contracts or permits to project developers, which in one instance led to an investigative report questioning the influence of a sexual relationship. Rent-seeking and land grabbing: Redirecting public funds or lands to benefit private developers and taking communal or public land from Indigenous peoples or other groups for energy infrastructure siting. Service diversion: Withholding local benefits, such as lower electricity bills, or distributing locally generated power only to higher-paying parts of the state. Theft: Forceful removal of flora or cultural artifacts, or disturbing animal habitat, to build solar project sites. Greenwashing: Misleading the public about a solar project's environmental benefits; using flawed environmental or cultural impact assessments to evaluate project impacts, such as pollution of nearby waterways; and overriding environmental protections to fast-track solar infrastructure expansion. Tax evasion and avoidance: Not paying or underpaying taxes, or governmental authorities strategically failing to adequately allocate project funds to communities impacted by solar project development. Non-transparency: Hiding, manipulating, or failing to disclose relevant or important information surrounding solar projects, such as the local economic benefits and environmental impacts.

A sunnier future?

Outside of a few headline-making scandals, corruption in California's renewable energy sector has gone largely unexamined, allowing the underlying dynamics at play to erode the potential of a just energy transition. To remedy this, the study's authors recommend corruption risk mapping to document problematic practices and entities, subsidy registers and sunset clauses to deter rent-seeking and tax evasion, transparency initiatives aimed at environmental changes and data production (for Environmental Impact Assessment), strong enforcement of anti-corruption laws, and shared ownership models for solar to improve accountability.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611084111.htm,"Eating a high-fat diet containing a large amount of oleic acid - a type of fatty acid commonly found in olive oil - could drive obesity more than other types of dietary fats, according to a study published in the journal Cell Reports.

The study found that oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat associated with obesity, causes the body to make more fat cells. By boosting a signaling protein called AKT2 and reducing the activity of a regulating protein called LXR, high levels of oleic acid resulted in faster growth of the precursor cells that form new fat cells.

""We know that the types of fat that people eat have changed during the obesity epidemic. We wanted to know whether simply overeating a diet rich in fat causes obesity, or whether the composition of these fatty acids that make up the oils in the diet is important. Do specific fat molecules trigger responses in the cells?"" said Michael Rudolph, Ph.D., assistant professor of biochemistry and physiology at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and member of OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center.

Rudolph and his team, including Matthew Rodeheffer, Ph.D., of Yale University School of Medicine and other collaborators at Yale and New York University School of Medicine, fed mice a variety of specialized diets enriched in specific individual fatty acids, including those found in coconut oil, peanut oil, milk, lard and soybean oil. Oleic acid was the only one that caused the precursor cells that give rise to fat cells to proliferate more than other fatty acids.

""You can think of the fat cells as an army,"" Rudolph said. ""When you give oleic acid, it initially increases the number of 'fat cell soldiers' in the army, which creates a larger capacity to store excess dietary nutrients. Over time, if the excess nutrients overtake the number of fat cells, obesity can occur, which can then lead to cardiovascular disease or diabetes if not controlled.""

Unfortunately, it's not quite so easy to isolate different fatty acids in a human diet. People generally consume a complex mixture if they have cream in their coffee, a salad for lunch and meat and pasta for dinner. However, Rudolph said, there are increasing levels of oleic acid in the food supply, particularly when access to food variety is limited and fast food is an affordable option.

""I think the take-home message is moderation and to consume fats from a variety of different sources,"" he said. ""Relatively balanced levels of oleic acid seem to be beneficial, but higher and prolonged levels may be detrimental. If someone is at risk for heart disease, high levels of oleic acid may not be a good idea.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611084115.htm,"Researchers identify ""meal memory"" neurons in laboratory rats that could explain why forgetting lunch leads to overeating.

Scientists have discovered a specific group of brain cells that create memories of meals, encoding not just what food was eaten but when it was eaten. The findings, published today in Nature Communications, could explain why people with memory problems often overeat and why forgetting about a recent meal can trigger excessive hunger and lead to disordered eating.

During eating, neurons in the ventral hippocampus region of the brain become active and form what the team of researchers call ""meal engrams"" -- specialized memory traces that store information about the experience of food consumption. While scientists have long studied engrams for their role in storing memories and other experiences in the brain, the new study identified engrams dedicated to meal experiences.

""An engram is the physical trace that a memory leaves behind in the brain,"" said Scott Kanoski, professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and corresponding author of the study. ""Meal engrams function like sophisticated biological databases that store multiple types of information such as where you were eating, as well as the time that you ate.""

Distracted eating implications

The discovery has immediate relevance for understanding human eating disorders. Patients with memory impairments, such as those with dementia or brain injuries that affect memory formation, may often consume multiple meals in quick succession because they cannot remember eating.

Furthermore, distracted eating -- such as mindlessly snacking while watching television or scrolling on a phone -- may impair meal memories and contribute to overconsumption.

Based on the experiment's findings, meal engrams are formed during brief pauses between bites when the brain of laboratory rats naturally survey the eating environment. These moments of awareness allow specialized hippocampal neurons to integrate multiple streams of information.

Kanoski said it can be assumed a human's brain would undergo a similar phenomenon. When someone's attention is focused elsewhere -- on phone or television screens -- these critical encoding moments are compromised. ""The brain fails to properly catalog the meal experience,"" said Lea Decarie-Spain, postdoctoral scholar at USC Dornsife and the study's first author, ""leading to weak or incomplete meal engrams.""

Mechanism of 'meal memories'

The research team used advanced neuroscience techniques to observe the brain activity of laboratory rats as they ate, providing the first real-time view of how meal memories form.

The meal memory neurons are distinct from brain cells involved in other types of memory formation. When researchers selectively destroyed these neurons, lab rats showed impaired memory for food locations but retained normal spatial memory for non-food-related tasks, indicating a specialized system dedicated to meal-related information processing. The study revealed that meal memory neurons communicate with the lateral hypothalamus, a brain region long known to control hunger and eating behavior. When this hippocampus-hypothalamus connection was blocked, the lab rats overate and could not remember where meals were consumed.

Eating management implications

Kanoski said the findings could eventually inform new clinical approaches for treating obesity and weight management. Current weight management strategies often focus on restricting food intake or increasing exercise, but the new research suggests that enhancing meal memory formation could be equally important.

""We're finally beginning to understand that remembering what and when you ate is just as crucial for healthy eating as the food choices themselves,"" Kanoski said.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611054148.htm,"For the first time, scientists have used Earth-based telescopes to look back over 13 billion years to see how the first stars in the universe affect light emitted from the Big Bang.

Using telescopes high in the Andes mountains of northern Chile, astrophysicists have measured this polarized microwave light to create a clearer picture of one of the least understood epochs in the history of the universe, the Cosmic Dawn.

""People thought this couldn't be done from the ground. Astronomy is a technology-limited field, and microwave signals from the Cosmic Dawn are famously difficult to measure,"" said Tobias Marriage, project leader and a Johns Hopkins professor of physics and astronomy. ""Ground-based observations face additional challenges compared to space. Overcoming those obstacles makes this measurement a significant achievement.""

Cosmic microwaves are mere millimeters in wavelength and very faint. The signal from polarized microwave light is about a million times fainter. On Earth, broadcast radio waves, radar, and satellites can drown out their signal, while changes in the atmosphere, weather, and temperature can distort it. Even in perfect conditions, measuring this type of microwave requires extremely sensitive equipment.

Scientists from the U.S. National Science Foundation's Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor, or CLASS, project used telescopes uniquely designed to detect the fingerprints left by the first stars in the relic Big Bang light -- a feat that previously had only been accomplished by technology deployed in space, such as the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and European Space Agency Planck space telescopes.

The new research, led by Johns Hopkins University and the University of Chicago, was published today in The Astrophysical Journal.

By comparing the CLASS telescope data with the data from the Planck and WMAP space missions, the researchers identified interference and narrowed in on a common signal from the polarized microwave light.

Polarization happens when light waves run into something and then scatter.

""When light hits the hood of your car and you see a glare, that's polarization. To see clearly, you can put on polarized glasses to take away glare,"" said first author Yunyang Li, who was a PhD student at Johns Hopkins and then a fellow at University of Chicago during the research. ""Using the new common signal, we can determine how much of what we're seeing is cosmic glare from light bouncing off the hood of the Cosmic Dawn, so to speak.""

After the Big Bang, the universe was a fog of electrons so dense that light energy was unable to escape. As the universe expanded and cooled, protons captured the electrons to form neutral hydrogen atoms, and microwave light was then free to travel through the space in between. When the first stars formed during the Cosmic Dawn, their intense energy ripped electrons free from the hydrogen atoms. The research team measured the probability that a photon from the Big Bang encountered one of the freed electrons on its way through the cloud of ionized gas and skittered off course.

The findings will help better define signals coming from the residual glow of the Big Bang, or the cosmic microwave background, and form a clearer picture of the early universe.

""Measuring this reionization signal more precisely is an important frontier of cosmic microwave background research,"" said Charles Bennett, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins who led the WMAP space mission. ""For us, the universe is like a physics lab. Better measurements of the universe help to refine our understanding of dark matter and neutrinos, abundant but elusive particles that fill the universe. By analyzing additional CLASS data going forward, we hope to reach the highest possible precision that's achievable.""

Building on research published last year that used the CLASS telescopes to map 75% of the night sky, the new results also help solidify the CLASS team's approach.

""No other ground-based experiment can do what CLASS is doing,"" says Nigel Sharp, program director in the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences which has supported the CLASS instrument and research team since 2010. ""The CLASS team has greatly improved measurement of the cosmic microwave polarization signal and this impressive leap forward is a testament to the scientific value produced by NSF's long-term support.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250611054144.htm,"How can the strange properties of quantum particles be exploited to perform extremely accurate measurements? This question is at the heart of the research field of quantum metrology. One example is the atomic clock, which uses the quantum properties of atoms to measure time much more accurately than would be possible with conventional clocks.

However, the fundamental laws of quantum physics always involve a certain degree of uncertainty. Some randomness or a certain amount of statistical noise has to be accepted. This results in fundamental limits to the accuracy that can be achieved. Until now, it seemed to be an immutable law that a clock twice as accurate requires at least twice as much energy. But now a team of researchers from TU Wien, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta have demonstrated that special tricks can be used to increase accuracy exponentially. The crucial point is using two different time scales - similar to how a clock has a second hand and a minute hand.

What exactly is a clock?

""We have analyzed in principle, which clocks could be theoretically possible,"" says Prof. Marcus Huber from the Atomic Institute at the TU Wien. ""Every clock needs two components: first, a time base generator - such as a pendulum in a pendulum clock, or even a quantum oscillation. And second, a counter - any element that counts how many time units defined by the time base generator have already passed.""

The time base generator can always return to exactly the same state. After one complete oscillation, the pendulum of a pendulum clock is exactly where it was before. After a certain number of oscillations, the caesium atom in an atomic clock returns to exactly the same state it was in before. The counter, on the other hand, must change - otherwise the clock is useless.

""This means that every clock must be connected to an irreversible process,"" says Florian Meier from TU Wien. ""In the language of thermodynamics, this means that every clock increases the entropy in the universe; otherwise, it is not a clock."" The pendulum of a pendulum clock generates a little heat and disorder among the air molecules around it, and every laser beam that reads the state of an atomic clock generates heat, radiation and thus entropy.

""We can now consider how much entropy a hypothetical clock with extremely high precision would have to generate - and, accordingly, how much energy such a clock would need,"" says Marcus Huber. ""Until now, there seemed to be a linear relationship: if you want a thousand times the precision, you have to generate at least a thousand times as much entropy and expend a thousand times as much energy.""

Quantum time and classical time

However, the research team at TU Wien, together with the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) in Vienna and the teams from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and University of Malta, has now shown that this apparent rule can be circumvented by using two different time scales.

""For example, you can use particles that move from one area to another to measure time, similar to how grains of sand indicate the time by falling from the top of the glass to the bottom,"" says Florian Meier. You can connect a whole series of such time-measuring devices in series and count how many of them have already passed through - similar to how one clock hand counts how many laps the other clock hand has already completed.

""This way, you can increase accuracy, but not without investing more energy,"" says Marcus Huber. ""Because every time one clock hand completes a full rotation and the other clock hand is measured at a new location - you could also say every time the environment around it notices that this hand has moved to a new location - the entropy increases. This counting process is irreversible.""

However, quantum physics also allows for another kind of particle transport: the particles can also travel through the entire structure, i.e. across the entire clock dial, without being measured anywhere. In a sense, the particle is then everywhere at once during this process; it has no clearly defined location until it finally arrives - and only then is it actually measured, in an irreversible process that increases entropy.

Like second and minute clock hands

""So we have a fast process that does not cause entropy - quantum transport - and a slow one, namely the arrival of the particle at the very end,"" explains Yuri Minoguchi, TU Wien. ""The crucial thing about our method is that one hand behaves purely in terms of quantum physics, and only the other, slower hand actually has an entropy-generating effect.""

The team has now been able to show that this strategy enables an exponential increase in accuracy per increase in entropy. This means that much higher precision can be achieved than would have been thought possible according to previous theories. ""What's more, the theory could be tested in the real world using superconducting circuits, one of the most advanced quantum technologies currently available.,"" says Simone Gasparinetti, co-author of the study and leader of the experimental team at Chalmers. ""This is an important result for research into high-precision quantum measurements and suppression of unwanted fluctuations,"" says Marcus Huber, ""and at the same time it helps us to better understand one of the great unsolved mysteries of physics: the connection between quantum physics and thermodynamics.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610112541.htm,"A simple rule that seems to govern how life is organized on Earth is described in a new study published on June 4 in Nature Ecology & Evolution.

The research team led, by Umeå University and involving the University of Reading, believe this rule helps explain why species are spread the way they are across the planet. The discovery will help to understand life on Earth - including how ecosystems respond to global environmental changes.

The rule is simple: in every region on Earth, most species cluster together in small 'hotspot' areas, then gradually spread outward with fewer and fewer species able to survive farther away from these hotspots.

Rubén Bernardo-Madrid, lead author and researcher at Umeå University (Sweden), said: ""In every bioregion, there is always a core area where most species live. From that core, species expand into surrounding areas, but only a subset manages to persist. It seems these cores provide optimal conditions for species survival and diversification, acting as a source from which biodiversity radiates outward.""

This pattern highlights the disproportionate ecological role these small areas play in sustaining the biodiversity of entire bioregions. Jose Luis Tella, from the Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC (Spain), said: ""Safeguarding these core zones is therefore essential, as they represent critical priorities for conservation strategies.""

Environmental filtering

Researchers studied bioregions across the world, examining species from very different life forms: amphibians, birds, dragonflies, mammals, marine rays, reptiles, and trees. Given the vast differences in life strategies -- some species fly, others crawl, swim, or remain rooted -- and the contrasting environmental and historical backgrounds of each bioregion, the researchers expected that species distribution would vary widely across bioregions. Surprisingly, they found the same pattern everywhere.

The pattern points to a general process known as environmental filtering. Environmental filtering has long been considered a key theoretical principle in ecology for explaining species distribution on Earth. Until now, however, global empirical evidence has been scarce. This study provides broad confirmation across multiple branches of life and at a planetary scale.

Professor Manuela González-Suárez, co-author of the study at the University of Reading, said: ""It doesn't matter whether the limiting factor is heat, cold, drought, or salinity. The result is always the same: only species able to tolerate local conditions establish and persist, creating a predictable distribution of life on Earth.""

The existence of a universal organising mechanism has profound implications for our understanding of life on Earth. Joaquín Calatayud, co-author from the Rey Juan Carlos University (Spain), said: ""This pattern suggests that life on Earth may be, to some extent, predictable."" Such predictable patterns can help scientists trace how life has diversified through time and offer valuable insights into how ecosystems might react to global environmental changes.",Science

Among the headline findings were the presence of silicate clouds in one of the planet's atmospheres, and a circumplanetary disk thought to feed material that can form moons around the other.

In broader terms, understanding how the ""YSES-1"" super-solar system formed offers further insight into the origins of our own solar system, and gives us the opportunity to watch and learn as a planet similar to Jupiter forms in real time.

""Directly imaged exoplanets -- planets outside our own Solar System -- are the only exoplanets that we can truly take photos of,"" said Dr Evert Nasedkin, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Trinity College Dublin's School of Physics, who is a co-author of the research article just published in leading international journal, Nature.""These exoplanets are typically still young enough that they are still hot from their formation and it is this warmth, seen in the thermal infrared, that we as astronomers observe.""

Using spectroscopic instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Dr Kielan Hoch and a large international team, including astronomers at Trinity College Dublin, obtained broad spectra of two young, giant exoplanets which orbit a sun-like star, YSES-1. These planets are several times larger than Jupiter, and orbit far from their host star, highlighting the diversity of exoplanet systems even around stars like our own sun.

The main goal of measuring the spectra of these exoplanets was to understand their atmospheres. Different molecules and cloud particles all absorb different wavelengths of light, imparting a characteristic fingerprint onto the emission spectrum from the planets.

Dr Nasedkin said: ""When we looked at the smaller, farther-out companion, known as YSES 1-c, we found the tell-tale signature of silicate clouds in the mid-infrared. Essentially made of sand-like particles, this is the strongest silicate absorption feature observed in an exoplanet yet.""

""We believe this is linked to the relative youth of the planets: younger planets are slightly larger in radius, and this extended atmosphere may allow the cloud to absorb more of the light emitted by the planet. Using detailed modelling, we were able to identify the chemical composition of these clouds, as well as details about the shapes and sizes of the cloud particles.""

The inner planet, YSES-1b offered up other surprises: while the whole planetary system is young, at 16.7 million years old, it is too old to find signs of the planet-forming disk around the host star. But around YSES-1b the team observed a disk around the planet itself, thought to feed material onto the planet and serve as the birthplace of moons - similar to those seen around Jupiter. Only three other such disks have been identified to date, both around objects significantly younger than YSES-1b, raising new questions as to how this disk could be so long-lived.

Dr Nasedkin added: ""Overall, this work highlights the incredible abilities of JWST to characterise exoplanet atmospheres. With only a handful of exoplanets that can be directly imaged, the YSES-1 system offers unique insights into the atmospheric physics and formation processes of these distant giants.""

In broad terms, understanding how this super-solar system formed offers further insight into the origins of our own solar system, giving us an opportunity to watch as a planet similar to Jupiter forms in real time. Understanding how long it takes to form planets, and the chemical makeup at the end of formation is important to learn what the building blocks of our own solar system looked like. Scientists can compare these young systems to our own, which provides hints of how our own planets have changed over time.

Dr Kielan Hoch, Giacconi Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ""This program was proposed before the launch of JWST. It was unique, as we hypothesized that the NIRSpec instrument on the future telescope should be able to observe both planets in its field of view in a single exposure, essentially, giving us two for the price of one. Our simulations ended up being correct post-launch, providing the most detailed dataset of a multi-planet system to-date.""

""The YSES-1 system planets are also too widely separated to be explained through current formation theories, so the additional discoveries of distinct silicate clouds around YSES-1 c and small hot dusty material around YSES-1 b leads to more mysteries and complexities for determining how planets form and evolve.""

""This research was also led by a team of early career researchers such as postdocs and graduate students who make up the first five authors of the paper. This work would not have been possible without their creativity and hard work, which is what aided in making these incredible multidisciplinary discoveries.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610112446.htm,"No image is infinitely sharp. For 150 years, it has been known that no matter how ingeniously you build a microscope or a camera, there are always fundamental resolution limits that cannot be exceeded in principle. The position of a particle can never be measured with infinite precision; a certain amount of blurring is unavoidable. This limit does not result from technical weaknesses, but from the physical properties of light and the transmission of information itself.

TU Wien (Vienna), the University of Glasgow and the University of Grenoble therefore posed the question: Where is the absolute limit of precision that is possible with optical methods? And how can this limit be approached as closely as possible? And indeed, the international team succeeded in specifying a lowest limit for the theoretically achievable precision and in developing AI algorithms for neural networks that come very close to this limit after appropriate training. This strategy is now set to be employed in imaging procedures, such as those used in medicine.

An absolute limit to precision

""Let's imagine we are looking at a small object behind an irregular, cloudy pane of glass,"" says Prof Stefan Rotter from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at TU Wien. ""We don't just see an image of the object, but a complicated light pattern consisting of many lighter and darker patches of light. The question now is: how precisely can we estimate where the object actually is based on this image -- and where is the absolute limit of this precision?""

Such scenarios are important in biophysics or medical imaging, for example. When light is scattered by biological tissue, it appears to lose information about deeper tissue structures. But how much of this information can be recovered in principle? This question is not only of technical nature, but physics itself sets fundamental limits here.

The answer to this question is provided by a theoretical measure: the so-called Fisher information. This measure describes how much information an optical signal contains about an unknown parameter -- such as the object position. If the Fisher information is low, precise determination is no longer possible, no matter how sophisticatedly the signal is analysed. Based on this Fisher information concept, the team was able to calculate an upper limit for the theoretically achievable precision in different experimental scenarios.

Neural networks learn from chaotic light patterns

While the team at TU Wien was providing theoretical input, a corresponding experiment was designed and implemented by Dorian Bouchet from the University of Grenoble (F) together with Ilya Starshynov and Daniele Faccio from the University of Glasgow (UK). In this experiment, a laser beam was directed at a small, reflective object located behind a turbid liquid, so that the recorded images only showed highly distorted light patterns. The measurement conditions varied depending on the turbidity -- and therefore also the difficulty of obtaining precise position information from the signal.

""To the human eye, these images look like random patterns,"" says Maximilian Weimar (TU Wien), one of the authors of the study. ""But if we feed many such images -- each with a known object position -- into a neural network, the network can learn which patterns are associated with which positions."" After sufficient training, the network was able to determine the object position very precisely, even with new, unknown patterns.

Almost at the physical limit

Particularly noteworthy: the precision of the prediction was only minimally worse than the theoretically achievable maximum, calculated using Fisher information. ""This means that our AI-supported algorithm is not only effective, but almost optimal,"" says Stefan Rotter. ""It achieves almost exactly the precision that is permitted by the laws of physics.""

This realisation has far-reaching consequences: With the help of intelligent algorithms, optical measurement methods could be significantly improved in a wide range of areas -- from medical diagnostics to materials research and quantum technology. In future projects, the research team wants to work with partners from applied physics and medicine to investigate how these AI-supported methods can be used in specific systems.",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610112506.htm,"Looking to nature for answers to complex questions can reveal new and unprecedented results that can even affect cells on molecular levels.

For instance, human cells oxidize glucose to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an energy source necessary for life. Cancer cells produce ATP through glycolysis, which does not utilize oxygen even under conditions where oxygen is present, and convert glucose into pyruvic acid and lactic acid. This method of producing ATP, known as the Warburg effect, is considered inefficient, thus raising questions as to why cancer cells choose this energy pathway to fuel their proliferation and survival.

In search for this energy catalyst, Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa's team at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Human Life and Ecology analyzed the cinnamic acid ester ethyl p-methoxycinnamate, a main component of kencur ginger, and its mechanism of action. In previous research, the team discovered that ethyl p-methoxycinnamate has inhibitory effects on cancer cells. Furthering their study, the acid ester was administered to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to assess which component of the cancer cells' energy pathway was being affected.

Results revealed that the acid ester inhibits ATP production by disrupting de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism, rather than through glycolysis as commonly theorized. Further, the researchers discovered acid ester-induced inhibition triggered increased glycolysis, which acted as a possible survival mechanism in the cells. This adaptability was theorized to be attributed to ethyl p-methoxycinnamate's inability to induce cell death.

""These findings not only provide new insights that supplement and expand the theory of the Warburg effect, which can be considered the starting point of cancer metabolism research, but are also expected to lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of new treatment methods,"" stated Professor Kojima-Yuasa.",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610074247.htm,"A new study from Hebrew University reveals that acetaminophen doesn't just work in the brain -- it also blocks pain at its source by acting on nerve endings in the body. The researchers found that its active metabolite, AM404, shuts down specific sodium channels in pain-sensing neurons, stopping pain signals before they reach the brain. This discovery not only reshapes our understanding of how one of the world's most common painkillers works, but also opens the door to developing safer, more targeted pain treatments.

A breakthrough study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, published this week in the prestigious journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA), reveals a previously unknown peripheral mechanism by which acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol, Tylenol®, or Panadol®) relieves pain.

The study was led by Prof. Alexander Binshtok from the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine and Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) and Prof. Avi Priel from its School of Pharmacy. Together, they uncovered a surprising new way that acetaminophen -- one of the world's most common painkillers -- actually works.

For decades, scientists believed that acetaminophen relieved pain by working only in the brain and spinal cord. But this new research, published in PNAS, shows that the drug also works outside the brain, in the nerves that first detect pain.

Their discovery centers on a substance called AM404, which the body makes after taking acetaminophen. The team found that AM404 is produced right in the pain-sensing nerve endings -- and that it works by shutting off specific channels (called sodium channels) that help transmit pain signals. By blocking these channels, AM404 stops the pain message before it even starts.

""This is the first time we've shown that AM404 works directly on the nerves outside the brain,"" said Prof. Binshtok. ""It changes our entire understanding of how acetaminophen fights pain.""

This breakthrough could also lead to new types of painkillers. Because AM404 targets only the nerves that carry pain, it may avoid the numbness, muscle weakness, and side effects that come with traditional local anesthetics.

""If we can develop new drugs based on AM404, we might finally have pain treatments that are highly effective but also safer and more precise,"" added Prof. Priel.",Science

The PainWaive technology, developed by UNSW Sydney researchers, teaches users how to regulate abnormal brain activity linked to chronic nerve pain, offering a potential in-home, non-invasive alternative to opioids.

A recent trial of the technology, led by Professor Sylvia Gustin and Dr Negin Hesam-Shariati from UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub, has delivered promising results, published in the Journal of Pain.

The study compared hundreds of measures across participants' pain and related issues like pain interference before, during and after four weeks of interactive game play. Their brain activity was tracked via EEG (electroencephalogram) headsets, with the app responding in real time to shifts in brainwave patterns.

Three out of the four participants showed significant reductions in pain, particularly nearing the end of the treatment. Overall, the pain relief achieved by the three was comparable to or greater than that offered by opioids.

""Restrictions in the study's size, design and duration limit our ability to generalise the findings or rule out placebo effects,"" Dr Hesam-Shariati says.

""But the results we've seen are exciting and give us confidence to move to the next stage and our larger trial.""

The PainWaive project builds on UNSW Professor Sylvia Gustin's seminal research into changes in the brain's thalamus -- a central relay hub in the brain -- associated with nerve (neuropathic) pain.

""The brainwaves of people with neuropathic pain show a distinct pattern: more slow theta waves, fewer alpha waves, and more fast, high beta waves,"" Prof. Gustin says.

""We believe these changes interfere with how the thalamus talks to other parts of the brain, especially the sensory motor cortex, which registers pain.""

""I wondered, can we develop a treatment that directly targets and normalises these abnormal waves?""

The challenge was taken up by an interdisciplinary team at UNSW Science and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), led by Prof. Gustin and Dr Hesam-Shariati, and resulted in PainWaive.

The four participants in its first trial received a kit with a headset and a tablet preloaded with the game app, which includes directions for its use. They were also given tips for different mental strategies, like relaxing or focusing on happy memories, to help bring their brain activity into a more ""normal"" state.

The user data, meanwhile, was uploaded to the research team for remote monitoring.

""After just a couple of Zoom sessions, participants were able to run the treatment entirely on their own,"" says Dr Hesam-Shariati.

""Participants felt empowered to manage their pain in their own environment. That's a huge part of what makes this special.""

Initially, Dr Hesam-Shariati says, the team planned to use existing commercial EEG systems, but they were either too expensive or didn't meet the quality needed to deliver the project. Instead, they developed their own.

""Everything except the open-source EEG board was built in-house,"" says Dr Hesam-Shariati. ""And soon, even that will be replaced by a custom-designed board.""

Thanks to 3D printing, Prof. Gustin says, the team has cut the cost of each headset to around $300 -- a fraction of the $1,000 to $20,000 price tags of existing systems.

The headset uses a saline-based wet electrode system to improve signal quality and targets the sensorimotor cortex.

""We've worked closely with patients to ensure the headset is lightweight, comfortable, and user-friendly,"" says Prof. Gustin.

""Owning the technology offers us the potential to one day offer PainWaive as a truly affordable, accessible solution for at-home pain management, especially for those with limited access to traditional treatments.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603115028.htm,"New research has found that those who consume a diverse range of foods rich in flavonoids, such as tea, berries, dark chocolate, and apples, could lower their risk of developing serious health conditions and have the potential to live longer.

The study was led by a team of researchers from Queen's University Belfast, Edith Cowan University Perth (ECU), and the Medical University of Vienna and Universitat Wien.

The findings reveal that increasing the diversity of flavonoids within your diet could help prevent the development of health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and neurological disease.

Flavonoids are found in plant foods like tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, apples, grapes, and even red wine and dark chocolate.

Published in Nature Food, the study tracked over 120,000 participants aging from 40 to 70 years old for over a decade. It is the first study of its kind to suggest that there is a benefit to consuming a wide range of flavonoids beyond that of simply consuming a high quantity.

ECU Research Fellow, first author and co-lead of the study Dr Benjamin Parmenter, made the initial discovery that a flavonoid-diverse diet is good for health.

""Flavonoid intakes of around 500 mg a day was associated with a 16% lower risk of all-cause mortality, as well as a ~10% lower risk of CVD, type 2 diabetes, and respiratory disease. That's roughly the amount of flavonoids that you would consume in two cups of tea.""

Dr Parmenter added, however, that those who consumed the widest diversity of flavonoids, had an even lower risk of these diseases, even when consuming the same total amount. For example, instead of just drinking tea, it's better to eat a range of flavonoid-rich foods to make up your intake, because different flavonoids come from different foods.

""We have known for some time that higher intakes of dietary flavonoids, powerful bioactives naturally present in many foods and drinks, can reduce the risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and neurological conditions like Parkinson's,"" study co-lead Professor Aedín Cassidy from the Co-Centre for Sustainable Food Systems and Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's said.

""We also know from lab data and clinical studies that different flavonoids work in different ways, some improve blood pressure, others help with cholesterol levels and decrease inflammation. This study is significant as the results indicate that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity has the potential to lead to a greater reduction in ill health than just a single source.""

Professor Tilman Kuhn from the Medical University of Vienna, Universitat Wien and Queen's University Belfast was also a co-lead author, noted that the importance of diversity of flavonoid intake has never been investigated until now, making this study very significant as the findings align with popular claims that eating colourful foods are invaluable to maintain good health.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603114637.htm,"As federal funding cuts impact decades of research, scientists could turn to black holes for cheaper, natural alternatives to expensive facilities searching for dark matter and similarly elusive particles that hold clues to the universe's deepest secrets, a new Johns Hopkins study of supermassive black holes suggests.

The findings could help complement multi-billion-dollar expenses and decades of construction needed for research complexes like Europe's Large Hadron Collider, the largest and highest-energy particle accelerator in the world.

""One of the great hopes for particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider is that it will generate dark matter particles, but we haven't seen any evidence yet,"" said study co-author Joseph Silk, an astrophysics professor at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Oxford, UK. ""That's why there are discussions underway to build a much more powerful version, a next-generation supercollider. But as we invest $30 billion and wait 40 years to build this supercollider — nature may provide a glimpse of the future in super massive black holes.""

The research was published on June 3 in Physical Review Letters.

Particle colliders smash protons and other subatomic particles into each other at nearly the speed of light, exposing the most fundamental aspects of matter. Subtle energy flashes and debris from the clash could reveal previously undiscovered particles, including potential candidates for dark matter, a critical but ghostly component of the universe that scientists have yet to detect. Facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile circular tunnel, have also helped transform the internet, cancer therapy, and high-performance computing.

A black hole can spin around its axis like a planet, but with much greater strength because of its intense gravitational field. Scientists are increasingly discovering that some rapidly spinning massive black holes at the centers of galaxies release enormous outbursts of plasma, likely because of jets powered by energy from their spin and surrounding accretion disks. It's these events that could potentially generate the same results as human-made supercolliders, the new study shows.

""If supermassive black holes can generate these particles by high-energy proton collisions, then we might get a signal on Earth, some really high-energy particle passing rapidly through our detectors,"" said Silk, who is also a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and at the University of Oxford. ""That would be the evidence for a novel particle collider within the most mysterious objects in the universe, attaining energies that would be unattainable in any terrestrial accelerator. We'd see something with a strange signature that conceivably provides evidence for dark matter, which is a bit more of a leap but it's possible.""

The new study shows that plunging ""gas flows"" near a black hole can draw energy from its spin, becoming much more violent than scientists thought possible. Near a rapidly spinning black hole, these particles can chaotically collide. Although not identical, the process is similar to the collisions scientists create using intense magnetic fields to accelerate particles in the circular tunnel of a high-energy particle collider.

""Some particles from these collisions go down the throat of the black hole and disappear forever. But because of their energy and momentum, some also come out, and it's those that come out which are accelerated to unprecedentedly high energies,"" Silk said. ""We figured out how energetic these beams of particles could be: as powerful as you get from a supercollider, or more. It's very hard to say what the limit is, but they certainly are up to the energy of the newest supercollider that we plan to build, so they could definitely give us complementary results.""

To detect such high-energy particles, scientists could use observatories already tracking supernovae, massive black hole eruptions, and other cosmic events, Silk said. These include detectors like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in the South Pole or the Kilometer Cube Neutrino Telescope, which recently detected the most energetic neutrino ever recorded under the Mediterranean Sea.

""The difference between a supercollider and a black hole is that black holes are far away,"" Silk said. ""But nevertheless, these particles will get to us.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603213454.htm,"A group of astronomers from across the globe, including a team from the University of Washington and led by Queen's University Belfast, have revealed new research showing that millions of new solar system objects will be detected by a brand-new facility, which is expected to come online later this year.

The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is set to revolutionize our knowledge of the solar system's ""small bodies"" -- asteroids, comets and other minor planets.

The Rubin Observatory, under construction on the Cerro Pachón ridge in northern Chile, features the 8.4-meter Simonyi Survey Telescope with a unique three-mirror design capable of surveying the entire visible sky every few nights. At its heart is the world's largest digital camera -- the 3.2 gigapixel Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Camera -- covering a 9.6 square-degree field of view with six filters, roughly 45 times the area of the full moon. Together, this ""wide-fast-deep"" system will generate 20 terabytes of data every night -- creating an unprecedented time-lapse ""movie"" of the cosmos over the next 10 years, and an incredibly powerful dataset with which to map the solar system.

The team of astronomers, led by Queen's University's Meg Schwamb, created Sorcha, an innovative new open-source software used to predict what discoveries are likely to be made. Sorcha is the first end-to-end simulator that ingests Rubin's planned observing schedule. It applies assumptions on how Rubin Observatory sees and detects astronomical sources in its images with the best model of what the solar system and its small body reservoirs look like today.

""Accurate simulation software like Sorcha is critical,"" said Schwamb, a reader in the School of Mathematics and Physics at Queen's University. ""It tells us what Rubin will discover and lets us know how to interpret it. Our knowledge of what objects fill Earth's solar system is about to expand exponentially and rapidly.""

In addition to the eight major planets, the solar system is home to a vast population of small bodies that formed alongside the planets more than 4.5 billion years ago. Many of these smaller bodies remain essentially unchanged since the solar system's birth, acting as a fossil record of its earliest days. By studying their orbits, sizes and compositions, astronomers can reconstruct how planets formed, migrated and evolved.

These objects -- numbering in the tens of millions -- -- provide a powerful window into processes such as the delivery of water and organic material to Earth, the reshaping of planetary orbits by giant planets and the ongoing risk posed by those whose paths bring them near our planet.

In addition to Queen's University and the UW, the international team includes researchers from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

A series of papers describing the software and the predictions have been accepted for publication by The Astronomical Journal.

Beyond just finding these new small bodies, Rubin Observatory will observe them multiple times using different optical filters, revealing their surface colors. Past solar system surveys typically observed with a single filter.

""With the LSST catalog of solar system objects, our work shows that it will be like going from black-and-white television to brilliant color,"" said Joe Murtagh, a doctoral student at Queen's University. ""It's very exciting -- we expect that millions of new solar system objects will be detected and most of these will be picked up in the first few years of sky survey.""

The team's simulations show that Rubin will map:

127,000 near-Earth objects -- asteroids and comets whose orbits cross or approach Earth. That's more than tripling today's known objects, about 38,000, and detecting more than 70% of potentially hazardous bodies larger than 140 meters. This will cut the risk of undetected asteroid impact of catastrophic proportions by at least two times, making a tremendous contribution to planetary defense.

Over 5 million main-belt asteroids, up from about 1.4 million, with precise color and rotation data on roughly one in three asteroids within the survey's first years. This will give scientists unprecedented insight into the characteristics and history of the solar system's building blocks.

109,000 Jupiter Trojans, bodies sharing Jupiter's orbit at stable ""Lagrange"" points -- more than seven times the number cataloged today. These bodies represent some of the most pristine material dating all the way back to the formation of the planets.

37,000 trans-Neptunian objects, residents of the distant Kuiper Belt -- nearly 10 times the current census -- shedding light on Neptune's past migration and the outer solar system's history.

Approximately 1,500-2,000 Centaurs, bodies on short-lived giant planet-crossing orbits in the middle solar system. Most Centaurs will eventually be ejected from the solar system, but a few lucky ones will survive to become short-period comets. The LSST will provide the first detailed view of the Centaurs and the important transition stage from Centaur to comet.

Rubin Observatory's LSST is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fill in the missing pieces of our solar system, said Mario Juric, a member of the Sorcha team and a UW professor of Astronomy. Juric also is a team lead of Rubin's Solar System Processing Pipelines and a director of UW's DiRAC Institute.

""Our simulations predict that Rubin will expand known small-body populations by factors of 4-9x, delivering an unprecedented trove of orbits, colors and light curves,"" Juric said. ""With this data, we'll be able to update the textbooks of solar system formation and vastly improve our ability to spot -- and potentially deflect -- the asteroids that could threaten Earth.""

It took 225 years of astronomical observations to detect the first 1.5 million asteroids, and researchers found that Rubin will double that number in less than a year, said Jake Kurlander, a doctoral student at the UW.

""Rubin's unparalleled combination of breadth and depth make it a uniquely effective discovery machine,"" Kurlander said.

Siegfried Eggl, an assistant professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign added: ""Only by debiasing LSST's complex observing pattern can we turn raw detections into a true reflection of the solar system's history -- where the planets formed, and how they migrated over billions of years. Sorcha is a game changer in that respect.""

The Sorcha code is open-source and freely available with the simulated catalogs, animations at https://sorcha.space. By making these resources available, the Sorcha team has enabled researchers worldwide to refine their tools and be ready for the flood of LSST data that Rubin will generate, advancing the understanding of the small bodies that illuminate the solar system like never before.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603114631.htm,"New research led by a Southwest Research Institute scientist identified a new source of energetic particles near the Sun. These definitive observations were made by instruments aboard NASA's Parker Solar Probe, which detected the powerful phenomena as the spacecraft dipped in and out of the solar corona.

These new results offer fresh perspectives on how magnetic reconnection could heat the solar atmosphere, which then transitions into the solar wind, and also how solar flares accelerate a small fraction of charged particles to near-relativistic speeds.

""Through the SwRI-led Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, scientists made the first direct detection of the source of magnetic reconnection near Earth, observing how this explosive physical process converts stored magnetic energy into kinetic energy and heat,"" said SwRI's Dr. Mihir Desai, lead author of a new paper about this research. ""Now Parker has made direct observations of how magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), where the interplanetary field reverses its polarity, energizes charged particles to extremely high energies.""

As Parker crossed the HCS, scientists discovered a sunward-directed reconnection jet and sunward-propagating highly energetic protons, establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites and not from unrelated processes at the Sun. Within the core of the reconnection exhaust, Parker detected trapped energetic protons a thousand times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle.

""These findings indicate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is an important source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind,"" Desai said. ""Everywhere there are magnetic fields there will be magnetic reconnection. But the Sun's magnetic fields are much stronger near the star, so there's a lot more stored energy to be released.""

Magnetic reconnection -- when magnetic field lines converge, break apart and reconnect in an explosive physical process -- energizes particles and generates high-speed flows. At the heart of space weather, reconnection is responsible for powerful solar events, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and drives disturbances in Earth's space environment. Such disturbances produce spectacular auroras but can also shut down electrical power grids and disrupt satellite-based communication and navigation systems.

""Reports from the American Meteorological Society indicated that the powerful solar events in May 2024 wreaked havoc with farmers when extreme geomagnetic storms disrupted the precise GPS-guided navigation systems used to plant, fertilize and harvest rows of seeds, causing an estimated loss of up to $500 million in earning potential,"" Desai said. ""Parker's access to this new data is critical, particularly as we remain in the midst of a very active solar cycle.""

Parker was able to make these measurements due to its record-breaking proximity to the Sun, flying through its corona up to three times a year. Of particular interest is understanding how the Sun's atmosphere heats up and accelerates the solar wind. Understanding these processes can also help scientists develop ways to predict and mitigate the effects of solar flares and CMEs, as well as provide new insights for laboratory fusion research.

The Parker Solar Probe was developed as part of NASA's Living With a Star program to explore aspects of the Sun-Earth system that directly affect life and society.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250602155332.htm,"Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided new clues about how the exoplanet WASP-121b has formed and where it might have originated in the disc of gas and dust around its star. These insights stem from the detection of multiple key molecules: water vapour, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane. With these detections, a team led by astronomers Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp was able to compile an inventory of the carbon, oxygen, and silicon in the atmosphere of WASP-121b. The detection of methane in particular also suggests strong vertical winds on the cooler nightside, a process often ignored in current models.

WASP-121b is an ultra-hot giant planet that orbits its host star at a distance only about twice the star's diameter, completing one orbit in approximately 30.5 hours. The planet exhibits two distinct hemispheres: one that always faces the host star, with temperatures locally exceeding 3000 degrees Celsius, and an eternal nightside where temperatures drop to 1500 degrees.

""Dayside temperatures are high enough for refractory materials -- typically solid compounds resistant to strong heat -- to exist as gaseous components of the planet's atmosphere,"" Thomas Evans-Soma explained. He is an astronomer affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany, and the University of Newcastle, Australia. He led the study published today in Nature Astronomy.

Unveiling the birthplace of WASP-121b

The team investigated the abundance of compounds that evaporate at very different temperatures, providing clues about the planet's formation and evolution. ""Gaseous materials are easier to identify than liquids and solids,"" noted MPIA student Cyril Gapp, the lead author of a second study published today in The Astronomical Journal. ""Since many chemical compounds are present in gaseous form, astronomers use WASP-121b as a natural laboratory to probe the properties of planetary atmospheres.""

The team concluded that WASP-121b likely accumulated most of its gas in a region cold enough for water to remain frozen yet sufficiently warm for methane (CH 4 ) to evaporate and exist in its gaseous form. Since planets form within a disc of gas and dust surrounding a young star, such conditions occur at distances where stellar radiation creates the appropriate temperatures.

In our own Solar System, this region lies somewhere between the orbits of Jupiter and Uranus. This is remarkable, given that WASP-121b now orbits perilously close to its host star's surface. It suggests that, after its formation, it undertook a long journey from the icy outer regions to the centre of the planetary system.

Reconstructing WASP-121b's eventful youth

Silicon was detected as silicon monoxide (SiO) gas, but originally entered the planet via rocky material such as quartz stored in planetesimals -- essentially asteroids -- after acquiring most of its gaseous envelope. The formation of planetesimals takes time, indicating that this process occurred during the later stages of planetary development.

""The relative abundances of carbon, oxygen, and silicon offer insights into how this planet formed and acquired its material."" -- Thomas Evans-Soma

Planet formation begins with icy dust particles that stick together and gradually grow into centimetre- to metre-sized pebbles. They attract surrounding gas and small particles, accelerating their growth. These are the seeds of future planets like WASP-121b. Drag from the surrounding gas causes the moving pebbles to spiral inward towards the star. As they migrate, their embedded ices begin to evaporate in the disc's warmer inner regions.

While the infant planets orbit their host stars, they may grow large enough to open substantial gaps within the protoplanetary disc. This halts the inward drift of pebbles and the supply with embedded ices but leaves enough gas available to build an extended atmosphere.

In the case of WASP-121b, this appears to have occurred at a location where methane pebbles evaporated, enriching the gas that the planet supplied with carbon. In contrast, water pebbles remained frozen, locking away oxygen. This scenario best explains why Evans-Soma and Gapp observed a higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet's atmosphere than in its host star. WASP-121b continued attracting carbon-rich gas after the flow of oxygen-rich pebbles had stopped, setting the final composition of its atmospheric envelope.

The detection of methane requires strong vertical currents

As the temperature of an atmosphere changes, the quantities of different molecules, such as methane and carbon monoxide, are expected to vary. At the ultra-high temperatures of WASP-121b's dayside, methane is highly unstable and won't be present in detectable quantities. Astronomers have determined for planets like WASP-121b that gas from the dayside hemisphere should be mixed around to the relatively cool nightside hemisphere faster than the gas composition can adjust to the lower temperatures. Under this scenario, one would expect the abundance of methane to be negligible on the nightside, just as it is on the dayside. When instead the astronomers detected plentiful methane on the nightside of WASP-121b, it was a total surprise.

To explain this result, the team proposes that methane gas must be rapidly replenished on the nightside to maintain its high abundance. A plausible mechanism for doing this involves strong vertical currents lifting methane gas from lower atmospheric layers, which are rich in methane thanks to the relatively low nightside temperatures combined with the high carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the atmosphere. ""This challenges exoplanet dynamical models, which will likely need to be adapted to reproduce the strong vertical mixing we've uncovered on the nightside of WASP-121b,"" said Evans-Soma.

JWST's role in the discovery

The team used JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to observe WASP-121b throughout its complete orbit around its host star. As the planet rotates on its axis, the heat radiation received from its surface varies, exposing different portions of its irradiated atmosphere to the telescope. This allowed the team to characterize the conditions and chemical composition of the planet's dayside and nightside.

The astronomers also captured observations as the planet transited in front of its star. During this phase, some starlight filters through the planet's atmospheric limb, leaving spectral fingerprints that reveal its chemical makeup. This type of measurement is especially sensitive to the transition region where gases from the dayside and nightside mix. ""The emerging transmission spectrum confirmed the detections of silicon monoxide, carbon monoxide, and water that were made with the emission data,"" Gapp noted. ""However, we could not find methane in the transition zone between the day and night side.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610074307.htm,"When volcanoes are preparing to erupt, scientists rely on typical signs to warn people living nearby: deformation of the ground and earthquakes, caused by underground chambers filling up with magma and volcanic gas. But some volcanoes, called 'stealthy' volcanoes, don't give obvious warning signs. Now scientists studying Veniaminof, Alaska, have developed a model which could explain and predict stealthy eruptions.

""Despite major advances in monitoring, some volcanoes erupt with little or no detectable precursors, significantly increasing the risk to nearby populations,"" said Dr Yuyu Li of the University of Illinois, lead author of the study in Frontiers in Earth Science. ""Some of these volcanoes are located near major air routes or close to communities: examples include Popocatépetl and Colima in Mexico, Merapi in Indonesia, Galeras in Colombia, and Stromboli in Italy.

""Our work helps explain how this happens, by identifying the key internal conditions -- such as low magma supply and warm host rock -- that make eruptions stealthy.""

Warning signs

Veniaminof is an ice-clad volcano in the Aleutian Arc of Alaska. It's carefully monitored, but only two of its 13 eruptions since 1993 have been preceded by enough signs to alert observing scientists. In fact, a 2021 eruption wasn't caught until three days after it had started.

""Veniaminof is a case study in how a volcano can appear quiet while still being primed to erupt,"" said Li. ""It is one of the most active volcanoes in Alaska. In recent decades, it has produced several VEI 3 eruptions -- moderate-sized explosive events that can send ash up to 15 km high, disrupt air traffic, and pose regional hazards to nearby communities and infrastructure -- often without clear warning signs.""

To understand Veniaminof better, the scientists used monitoring data over three summer seasons immediately before the 2018 stealthy eruption, which produced only ambiguous warning signs immediately before it happened. They created a model of the volcano's behavior in different conditions which would change the impact of a filling magma reservoir on the ground above: six potential volumes of magma reservoir, a range of magma flow rates and reservoir depths, and three shapes of reservoir. They then compared the models to the data to see which matched best, and which conditions produced eruptions, stealthy or otherwise.

Volcano by the numbers

They found that a high flow of magma into a chamber increases the deformation of the ground and the likelihood of an eruption. If magma is flowing quickly into a large chamber, an eruption may not occur, but if one does the ground will deform enough to warn scientists first. Similarly, a high flow of magma into a small chamber is likely to produce an eruption, but not a stealthy one. Stealthy eruptions become likely when a low flow of magma enters a relatively small chamber. Compared to observational data, the results suggest that Veniaminof has a small magma chamber and a low flow of magma.

The model also suggests that different conditions could produce different warning signs. Magma flowing into larger, flatter chambers may cause minimal earthquakes, while smaller, more elongated chambers may produce little deformation of the ground. But stealthy eruptions only happen when all the conditions are in place -- the right magma flow and the right chamber size, shape, and depth.

However, when the scientists added temperature to their model, they found that if magma is consistently present over time so that the rock of the chamber is warm, size and shape matters less. If the rock is warm, it's less likely to fail in ways that cause detectable earthquakes or deformation of the ground when magma flows into the chamber, increasing the likelihood of a stealthy eruption.

What next?

""To mitigate the impact of these potential surprise eruptions, we need to integrate high-precision instruments like borehole tiltmeters and strainmeters and fiber optic sensing, as well as newer approaches such as infrasound and gas emission monitoring,"" said Li. ""Machine learning has also shown promise in detecting subtle changes in volcanic behavior, especially in earthquake signal picking.""

At Veniaminof, taking measures to improve the coverage of satellite monitoring and adding tiltmeters and strainmeters could improve the rate of detection. In the meantime, scientists now know which volcanoes they need to watch most closely: volcanoes with small, warm reservoirs and slow magma flows.

""Combining these models with real-time observations represents a promising direction for improving volcano forecasting,"" said Li. ""In the future, this approach can enable improved monitoring for these stealthy systems, ultimately leading to more effective responses to protect nearby communities.""",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610004054.htm,"After the island of Madagascar drifted away from India 88 million years ago, isolating it from all other landmasses, its flora and fauna evolved in seclusion. As these transformed into plants and animals completely unique to their island, Madagascar became a biodiversity hotspot unlike anywhere else on Earth.

An important facet of this biodiversity is an ecological process called endozoochory, which is when animals eat plant seeds and then poop them out somewhere else, aiding in the spread of the plants. Most research on endozoochory has focused on the roles of birds and mammals as seed dispersers, but lizards, which are also known play a significant role, have remained largely overlooked.

This negligence inspired a team of researchers at Kyoto University to shine a spotlight on the humble lizard. Unlike many seed dispersers, lizards are not typically frugivores, animals that thrive on fruit and other fruit-like plant substances such as nuts and seeds. Fewer than 10% of lizard species have been reported to consume fruits, but those that do can play an important role, and some lizards are even known to act as primary seed dispersers for certain plant species.

""Lizards are under-appreciated as seed dispersers in many forest ecosystems, but we hypothesized that they may play a more important role across a broader range of regions than previously recognized,"" says corresponding author Ryobu Fukuyama.

The research team focused on three lizard species in a tropical dry forest in Madagascar, conducting behavioral observations, fecal analyses, and seed germination tests. The species, the Malagasy Giant Chameleon, Cuvier's Madagascar Swift, and the Western Girdled Lizard, are omnivores known to subsist on fruits, but they had not yet been carefully studied.

The team's results revealed that the lizards consumed fruits from over 20 plant species and expelled viable seeds. These plant species were largely different from those typically consumed by the Common Brown Lemur, a principal seed disperser in Madagascar's forests, indicating the lizards may play a more crucial role than previously thought.

Their project isn't only about acknowledging the importance of lizards, however. In recent years, environmental degradation caused by human activities has taken a toll on Malagasy forests, making some uninhabitable for large frugivores like lemurs. In contrast, the lizard species observed in this study can continue to inhabit these degraded environments. As seed dispersers, these lizards could potentially contribute to forest regeneration, but there are still many unknowns.

""Although lizards in Madagascar consume fruits from many plant species, other aspects of their role as seed dispersers, such as dispersal distances, remain poorly understood,"" says Fukuyama. In the future, the team intends to focus further on these additional unknowns.",Science

ting tectonic plates -- these are all signs that our planet is alive. But what is revealed deep inside the Earth surprises laymen and scientists alike: Almost 3000 kilometers below the Earth's surface, solid rock is flowing that is neither liquid, like lava, nor brittle like solid rock. This is shown by a new study by geoscientists led by Motohiko Murakami, Professor of Experimental Mineral Physics at ETH Zurich. The study has just been published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Half a century of guesswork

For over 50 years, researchers have been puzzling over a strange zone deep inside the Earth -- the so-called D"" layer, around 2700 kilometers beneath our feet. Earthquake waves suddenly behave differently there: their speed jumps as if they were traveling through a different material. What exactly happens at that layer of the mantle has been unclear for a long time, until now.

In 2004, Murakami, who has been a professor at ETH Zurich since 2017, discovered that perovskite, the main mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, transforms into a new mineral near the D"" layer under extreme pressure and very high temperatures -- so-called ""post-perovskite.""

The researchers assumed that this change explained the strange acceleration of the seismic waves. But that was not the full story. In 2007, Murakami and colleagues found new evidence that the phase change of perovskite alone is not enough to accelerate earthquake waves.

Using a sophisticated computer model, they finally discovered something important: depending on the direction in which the post-perovskite crystals point, the hardness of the mineral changes. Only when all the crystals of the mineral point in the same direction in the model are the seismic waves accelerated -- as can be observed in the D"" layer at a depth of 2700 kilometers.

In an unusual laboratory experiment at ETH Zurich, Murakami has now proven that post-perovskite crystals align themselves in the identical direction under enormous pressure and extreme temperatures. To do this, the researchers measured the speed of seismic waves in their experiment and were also able to reproduce the jump that occurs at the D"" layer in the laboratory. ""We have finally found the last piece of the puzzle,"" says Murakami.

Mantle flow aligns crystals

The big question is: what makes these crystals line up? The answer is that solid mantle rock that flows horizontally along the lower edge of the Earth's mantle. Researchers have long suspected that this movement -- a kind of convection like boiling water -- must exist but have never been able to prove it directly.

A new chapter in Earth research begins

Murakami and his colleagues have now also demonstrated experimentally that mantle convection of solid rock is present at the boundary between the core and the Earth's mantle, i.e. that solid -- not liquid -- rock flows slowly but steadily at this depth. ""This discovery not only solves the mystery of the D"" layer but also opens a window into the dynamics in the depths of the Earth,"" Murakami explains.

It is not only a milestone, but also a turning point. The assumption that solid rock flows has been transformed from a theory into a certainty. ""Our discovery shows that the Earth is not only active on the surface, but is also in motion deep inside,"" says the ETH professor.

With this knowledge, researchers can now begin to map the currents in the Earth's deepest interior and thus visualize the invisible motor that drives volcanoes, tectonic plates, and perhaps even the Earth's magnetic field.",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603115020.htm,"ing time in or around nature can provide people suffering from chronic lower back pain with a degree of escapism that helps them better manage their physical discomfort, a new study has shown.

The research, published in The Journal of Pain, is the first of its kind to ask people experiencing chronic lower back pain – in some cases for almost 40 years – about the role nature plays in any coping strategies they employ to help manage their condition.

The researchers found that people able to get out in nature said it enabled them to connect with others on a social level whereas they might otherwise spend the majority of their time indoors and isolated.

It provided them with a degree of distraction from their pain and a sense of escapism from their daily lives, and they enjoyed the opportunity to exercise in pleasant surroundings, preferring it to gyms or similar settings.

In addition, natural features such as fresh air and the sound and visual presence of water, the interviewees said, helped give them a feeling of tranquillity that relieved the stresses and anxieties created by their pain levels.

However, they did have concerns about the accessibility of some spaces, with factors such as unsteady or uneven terrain and a lack of seating having the potential to reduce their enjoyment of – and making them less inclined to visit – certain places.

Based on their findings, the researchers have recommended that people with chronic lower back pain – and the clinicians treating them – give greater consideration to the role nature can play in their health and wellbeing, and suggested natural spaces could be adapted to incorporate more accessible design features.

They are also working with people with varying forms of chronic pain to develop and test virtual reality innovations that may enable them to experience the benefits of being in nature on occasions where they can’t physically access them.

The study was conducted by experts in pain management and environmental psychology at the University of Plymouth and University of Exeter, and is based on interviews with 10 people who had experienced chronic lower back pain for between five and 38 years.

Alexander Smith, a PhD researcher in the University of Plymouth’s School of Psychology and the study’s lead author, said: “Lower back pain, like many other forms of physical discomfort, can be debilitating, isolating and exhausting. But amid a push for novel and more holistic therapies to treat chronic pain, nature has been suggested as a potential option. Our research showed that those able to get out into nature saw the benefits of doing so, both from a physical and a mental perspective. Simple changes, such as better paths and seating, and technological innovations including virtual reality may help make those benefits accessible to everyone. But we hope our findings open the door to greater exploration of how that might be achieved.”

Dr Sam Hughes, Senior Lecturer in Pain Neuroscience at the University of Exeter and the study’s senior author, added: “This study addresses important questions about health equity and the significant physical barriers faced by people living with chronic pain in accessing natural spaces. Many individuals encounter substantial obstacles, including uneven terrain, limited seating, or difficulties leaving their homes, making it challenging for them to benefit from the restorative properties of nature. We think that future research could use immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, to help overcome these barriers which would enable individuals to experience the benefits of nature without needing to physically navigate inaccessible environments. This could significantly enhance inclusivity and accessibility in chronic pain management strategies in the future.”",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250529155423.htm,"Long considered a disease brought to the Americas by European colonizers, leprosy may actually have a much older history on the American continent. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the University of Colorado (USA), in collaboration with various institutions in America and Europe, reveal that a recently identified second species of bacteria responsible for leprosy, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, has been infecting humans in the Americas for at least 1,000 years, several centuries before the Europeans arrived. These findings will be published in the journal Science on May 29, 2025.

Leprosy is a neglected disease, mainly caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, affecting thousands of people worldwide: approximately 200,000 new cases of leprosy are reported each year. Although M. leprae remains the primary cause, this study focused on another species, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, discovered in the United States in 2008 in a Mexican patient, and later in 2016 in red squirrels in the British Isles. Led by scientists from the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur, also associated with the CNRS, and the University of Colorado, in collaboration with Indigenous communities and over 40 scientists from international institutions including archaeologists, this study analyzed DNA from nearly 800 samples, including ancient human remains (from archaeological excavations) and recent clinical cases presenting symptoms of leprosy. The results confirm that M. lepromatosis was already widespread in North and South America long before European colonization and provide insights into the current genetic diversity of pathogenic Mycobacteria.

""This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in America,"" said Dr. Maria Lopopolo, the first author of the study and researcher at the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur. ""It shows that a form of the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations well before the Europeans arrived.""

The team used advanced genetic techniques to reconstruct the genomes of M. lepromatosis from ancient individuals found in Canada and Argentina. Despite the geographic distance of several thousand kilometers, these ancient strains dating from similar periods (approximately 1,000 years ago) were found to be surprisingly genetically close. Although they belong to two distinct branches in the evolutionary tree of the genus Mycobacterium, these branches are genetically closer to each other than to any other known branch. This genetic proximity, combined with their geographical distance, necessarily implies a rapid spread of the pathogen across the continent, likely within just a few centuries.

The scientists also identified several new lineages, including an ancestral branch that despite having diverged from the rest of the known species' diversity over 9,000 years ago, it continues to infect humans today in North America -- a discovery suggesting an ancient and long-lasting diversification on the continent, as well as a largely unexplored diversity that likely remains to be found.

Notably, the analyses also suggest that the strains found in red squirrels in the UK in 2016 are part of an American lineage that was introduced to the British Isles in the 19th century, where it subsequently spread. This discovery highlights the recent ability of the pathogen to cross continents, likely through human or commercial exchanges.

""We are just beginning to uncover the diversity and global movements of this recently identified pathogen. The study allows us to hypothesize that there might be unknown animal reservoirs,"" said Nicolás Rascovan, the lead author of the study and head of the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur. ""This study clearly illustrates how ancient and modern DNA can rewrite the history of a human pathogen and help us better understand the epidemiology of contemporary infectious diseases.""

The project was conducted in close collaboration with Indigenous communities, which were involved in decisions regarding the use of ancestral remains and the interpretation of results. Ancient DNA and remaining materials were returned when requested, and the generated data was shared via ethical and adaptable platforms designed to allow data sharing that meets the specific expectations of Indigenous communities.",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250521124251.htm,"Mice genetically engineered to lack the ability to make the amino acid cysteine, and fed a cysteine-free diet, lost 30 percent of their body weight in just one week, a new study shows.

Published online May 21 in Nature, the work found that cysteine depletion disrupts the normal metabolic pathways used by mammalian cells to convert food into energy, forcing the animals to rapidly burn fat stores in a futile attempt to meet energy demands.

Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study reveals key details about how cells process fuels like carbohydrates and fats (metabolism), and how cysteine depletion affects tissues. Experiments showed that lowering cysteine levels caused a drop in levels of the small molecule called coenzyme A (CoA), which rendered inefficient mechanisms that convert carbohydrates and fats into energy.

Despite CoA being involved in more than 100 intermediate metabolic reactions and serving as a partner (cofactor) for 4% of all enzymes in the body, scientists had previously been unable to study its function directly. This is because mice with defective CoA synthesis typically do not survive beyond three weeks of age. The current findings detail, for the first time, how CoA shapes metabolism in adult mice.

""Our surprising findings reveal that low cysteine levels triggered rapid fat loss in our study mice by activating a network of interconnected biological pathways,"" said co-senior study author Evgeny Nudler, PhD, the Julie Wilson Anderson Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. ""While driving weight loss in the clinic remains a key future mission, we are most excited for the moment about the profound, fundamental aspects of metabolism revealed in this study,"" added Dr. Nudler.

The current finding does not immediately suggest a new approach to weight loss, the authors caution, as cysteine is found in nearly all foods. Achieving a truly cysteine-free diet would require patients to consume a specially formulated solution that would be challenging for most. Moreover, because cysteine is involved in numerous cellular pathways, eliminating it -- such as through a drug that inhibits cysteine production -- could make organs more vulnerable to everyday toxins, including medications.

That said, the study authors say it is worth considering that fruits, vegetables, and legumes contain much lower levels of cysteine and its precursor, the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine, than red meat. While earlier studies have linked low sulfur amino acid intake to health benefits, this study clarifies that these benefits are due to cysteine depletion specifically, and not methionine restriction.

""Given that achieving maximum cysteine deprivation weight loss in the mice was dependent on both diet and deletion of the gene, moving forward we can now restore cysteine production genetically in specific cells or tissues and determine the role of each in the dramatic weight loss we observed,"" said co-senior author Dan L. Littman, MD, PhD, the Helen L. and Martin S. Kimmel Professor of Molecular Immunology in the Department of Pathology, and a professor in the Department of Cell Biology, at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ""We hope in the future to hijack parts of this process to induce a similar weight loss in humans but without completely removing cysteine,"" added Dr. Littman, who is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Overlapping Mechanisms

The study is the first to examine the effects of removing cysteine, or any of the nine of the essential amino acids, which must be obtained through diet and are required for building proteins that make up most of the body's enzymes, tissues, and signaling molecules. The findings revealed that eliminating cysteine from the mammalian body led to far greater weight loss than the removal of any other essential amino acid.

Specifically, cysteine deprivation disrupted oxidative phosphorylation, the main process for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that serves as cells' energy currency. Oxidative phosphorylation is known to be tightly dependent on CoA. As a result, sugar-derived intermediate molecules (carbon skeletons) such as pyruvate, orotate, citrate, and α-ketoglutarate were no longer used efficiently, and were instead lost in the urine. In response, the body turned to stored lipids (fats) to make energy.

Further, the team found that cysteine restriction activates both the integrated stress response (ISR), a signaling network that restores cellular balance after stress, and the oxidative stress response (OSR), which is triggered by higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following depletion of glutathione, the body's primary antioxidant. ROS can oxidize (take away electrons from) and damage sensitive cell parts like DNA.

Remarkably, this simultaneous activation of ISR and OSR -- previously observed only in cancer cells -- was shown to occur in normal tissues in mice in the cysteine-restriction group, with the two stress responses reinforcing each other. The study also shows that ISR and OSR, acting independently of CoA depletion, increase production of the stress hormone GDF15, which contributes to food aversion and degradation of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase, a key enzyme in lipid synthesis. This increased weight loss further in the study mice by preventing the replenishment of their fat stores.",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250519131126.htm,"An experimental drug developed at Duke University School of Medicine could offer powerful pain relief without the dangerous side effects of opioids.

The drug, called SBI-810, is part of a new generation of compounds designed to target a receptor on the nerves and spinal cord. While opioids flood multiple cellular pathways indiscriminately, SBI-810, a non-opioid treatment, takes a more focused approach, activating only a specific pain-relief pathway that avoids the euphoric ""high"" linked to addiction.

In tests in mice, SBI-810 worked well on its own and, when used in combination, made opioids more effective at lower doses, according to the study published May 19 in Cell.

""What makes this compound exciting is that it is both analgesic and non-opioid,"" said senior study author Ru-Rong Ji, PhD, an anesthesiology and neurobiology researcher who directs the Duke Anesthesiology Center for Translational Pain Medicine.

Even more encouraging: it prevented common side effects like constipation and buildup of tolerance, which often forces patients to need stronger and more frequent doses of opioids over time.

SBI-810 is in early development, but Duke researchers are aiming for human trials soon and they've locked in multiple patents for the discovery.

There's an urgent need for pain relief alternatives. Drug overdose deaths are declining, but more than 80,000 Americans still die each year most often from opioids. Meanwhile, chronic pain affects one-third of the U.S. population.

Researchers said the drug could be a safer option for treating both short-term and chronic pain for those recovering from surgery or living with diabetic nerve pain.

SBI-810 is designed to target the brain receptor neurotensin receptor 1. Using a method known as biased agonism, it switches on a specific signal -- β-arrestin-2 -- linked to pain relief, while avoiding other signals that can cause side effects or addiction.

""The receptor is expressed on sensory neurons and the brain and spinal cord,"" Ji said. ""It's a promising target for treating acute and chronic pain.""

SBI-810 effectively relieved pain from surgical incisions, bone fractures, and nerve injuries better than some existing painkillers. When injected in mice, it reduced signs of spontaneous discomfort, such as guarding and facial grimacing.

Duke scientists compared SBI-810 to oliceridine, a newer type of opioid used in hospitals, and found SBI-810 worked better in some situations, with fewer signs of distress.

Unlike opioids like morphine, SBI-810 didn't cause tolerance after repeated use. It also outperformed gabapentin, a common drug for nerve pain, and didn't cause sedation or memory problems, which are often seen with gabapentin.

Researchers said the compound's dual action -- on both the peripheral and central nervous systems -- could offer a new kind of balance in pain medicine: powerful enough to work, yet specific enough to avoid harm.

The study was supported by the NIH and the Department of Defense.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250515141549.htm,"An international genomics study led by scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) at the Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) and Asian School of the Environment (ASE) has shown that early Asians made humanity's longest prehistoric migration.

These prehistoric humans, roaming the earth over a hundred thousand years ago, would have traversed more than 20,000 kilometres on foot from North Asia to the southernmost tip of South America.

This journey would have taken multiple generations of humans, taking thousands of years. In the past, land masses were also different, with ice bridging certain portions that made the route possible.

Supported by the GenomeAsia100K consortium [1], the study was published this week in Science, which analyses DNA sequence data from 1,537 individuals representing 139 diverse ethnic groups.

The study involved 48 authors from 22 institutions across Asia, Europe and the Americas.

The researchers traced an ancient migratory journey that began in Africa, proceeded through North Asia and ended at Tierra del Fuego in modern-day Argentina, which is considered the final boundary of human migration on Earth.

By comparing patterns of shared ancestry and genetic variations that accumulate over time, the team was able to trace how groups split, moved, and adapted to new environments.

These patterns allowed the team to reconstruct ancient migration routes and estimate when different populations diverged.

The reconstructed routes gave a detailed picture of how early humans reached the far edge of the Americas, and the findings suggested that this pioneering group overcame extreme environmental challenges to complete their journey across millennia.

A key insight was that these early migrants arrived at the northwestern tip of South America, where modern-day Panama meets Colombia, approximately 14,000 years ago.

From this critical point of entry, the population diverged into four major groups: one remained in the Amazon basin, while the others moved eastward to the Dry Chaco region and southward to Patagonia's ice fields, navigating the valleys of the Andes Mountains, the highest mountain range outside of Asia.

By analysing the genetic profiles of indigenous populations in Eurasia and South America, researchers from the GenomeAsia100K project have, for the first time, mapped the unexpectedly large genetic diversity of Asia.

Understanding migration and genetic resilience

The study also sheds light on the evolutionary consequences of such a vast migration.

Associate Professor Kim Hie Lim from NTU's Asian School of the Environment, the study's corresponding author, explained that the arduous journey over thousands of years had reduced the genetic diversity of the migrant population.

""Those migrants carried only a subset of the gene pool in their ancestral populations through their long journey. Thus, the reduced genetic diversity also caused a reduced diversity in immune-related genes, which can limit a population's flexibility to fight various infectious diseases,"" explained Assoc Prof Kim, a Principal Investigator at SCELSE and Vice-Director of GenomeAsia100K.

""This could explain why some Indigenous communities were more susceptible to illnesses or diseases introduced by later immigrants, such as European colonists. Understanding how past dynamics have shaped the genetic structure of today's current population can yield deeper insights into human genetic resilience.""

SCELSE Senior Research Fellow Dr Elena Gusareva, the study's first author, said that these early groups settled into new ecological niches, and over hundreds of generations, their bodies and lifestyles evolved in response to the unique challenges of each region.

""Our findings highlight the extraordinary adaptability of early, diverse indigenous groups who successfully settled in vastly different environments. Using high-resolution whole-genome sequencing technology at SCELSE, we can now uncover the deep history of human migration and the genetic footprints left behind by the early settlers.""

Importance of Asian representation in genetic studies

NTU Professor Stephan Schuster, the study's senior author of the paper and the Scientific Director of the GenomeAsia100K consortium, said: ""Our study shows that a greater diversity of human genomes is found in Asian populations, not European ones, as has long been assumed due to sampling bias in large-scale genome sequencing projects.""

""This reshapes our understanding of historical population movements and lays a stronger foundation for future research into human evolution. Our new insights underscore the importance of increasing the representation of Asian populations in genetic studies, especially as genomics plays a critical role in personalised medicine, public health, and the understanding of human evolution,"" added Prof Schuster, who is the President's Chair in Genomics at NTU's School of Biological Sciences, and the Deputy Centre Director at SCELSE.

By tracing the impact of migration and isolation on genetic characteristics, the study offers insights into how different populations respond to diseases and how their immune systems have evolved.

The findings also help scientists better understand the genetic makeup of Native American populations and help policymakers to better protect and conserve native communities.

It also demonstrates how advanced genomic tools and global collaboration can deepen humanity's understanding of human evolution and inform future medical and scientific breakthroughs.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250515131435.htm,"A research team supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and safely delivered a personalized gene editing therapy to treat an infant with a life-threatening, incurable genetic disease. The infant, who was diagnosed with the rare condition carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency shortly after birth, has responded positively to the treatment. The process, from diagnosis to treatment, took only six months and marks the first time the technology has been successfully deployed to treat a human patient. The technology used in this study was developed using a platform that could be tweaked to treat a wide range of genetic disorders and opens the possibility of creating personalized treatments in other parts of the body.

A team of researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) developed the customized therapy using the gene-editing platform CRISPR. They corrected a specific gene mutation in the baby's liver cells that led to the disorder. CRISPR is an advanced gene editing technology that enables precise changes to DNA inside living cells. This is the first known case of a personalized CRISPR-based medicine administered to a single patient and was carefully designed to target non-reproductive cells so changes would only affect the patient.

""As a platform, gene editing -- built on reusable components and rapid customization -- promises a new era of precision medicine for hundreds of rare diseases, bringing life-changing therapies to patients when timing matters most: Early, fast, and tailored to the individual,"" said Joni L. Rutter, Ph.D., director of NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

CPS1 deficiency is characterized by an inability to fully break down byproducts from protein metabolism in the liver, causing ammonia to build up to toxic levels in the body. It can cause severe damage to the brain and liver. Treatment includes a low protein diet until the child is old enough for a liver transplant. However, in this waiting period there is a risk of rapid organ failure due to stressors such as infection, trauma, or dehydration. High levels of ammonia can cause coma, brain swelling, and may be fatal or cause permanent brain damage.

The child initially received a very low dose of the therapy at six months of age, then a higher dose later. The research team saw signs that the therapy was effective almost from the start. The six-month old began taking in more protein in the diet, and the care team could reduce the medicine needed to keep ammonia levels low in the body. Another telling sign of the child's improvement to date came after the child caught a cold, and later, had to deal with a gastrointestinal illness. Normally, such infections for a child in this condition could be extremely dangerous, especially with the possibility of ammonia reaching dangerous levels in the brain.

""We knew the method used to deliver the gene-editing machinery to the baby's liver cells allowed us to give the treatment repeatedly. That meant we could start with a low dose that we were sure was safe,"" said CHOP pediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, M.D., Ph.D.

""We were very concerned when the baby got sick, but they just shrugged the illness off,"" said Penn geneticist and first author Kiran Musunuru, M.D., Ph.D. For now, much work remains, but the researchers are cautiously optimistic about the baby's progress.

The scientists announced their work at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Meeting on May 15th and described the study in The New England Journal of Medicine.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250507125838.htm,"Research led by climate scientists from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) reveals that millions of today's young people will live through unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical storms under current climate policies. If global temperatures rise by 3.5°C by 2100, 92% of children born in 2020 will experience unprecedented heatwave exposure over their lifetime, affecting 111 million children. Meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target could protect 49 million children from this risk.

This is only for one birth year; when instead taking into account all children who are between 5 and 18 years old today, this adds up to 1.5 billion children affected under a 3.5°C scenario, and with 654 million children that can be protected by remaining under the 1.5°C threshold. The study also highlights that children with high socioeconomic vulnerability face an even greater likelihood of unprecedented exposure to climate extremes in their lifetime. Deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are urgently needed to safeguard the lives of children all around the world.

Climate change's disproportionate burden on youth

Climate extremes, including heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, tropical cyclones, wildfires and droughts, will intensify with continued atmospheric warming. Today's children will endure more climate extremes then any previous generation.

""In 2021, we demonstrated how children are to face disproportionate increases in extreme event exposure -- especially in low-income countries. Now, we examined where the cumulative exposure to climate extremes across one's lifetime will far exceed that which would have been experienced in a pre-industrial climate"" says Wim Thiery, professor of climate science at VUB and senior author of the study.

""In this new study, living an unprecedented life means that without climate change, one would have less than a 1-in-10,000 chance of experiencing that many climate extremes across one's lifetime"" says Dr. Luke Grant, lead author and climate scientist at the VUB and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). ""This is a stringent threshold that identifies populations facing climate extremes far beyond what could be expected without man-made climate change."" The threshold varies by location and type of climate extreme.

By combining demographic data and climate model projections of climate extremes for each location on earth, the researchers calculated the percentage of each generation born between 1960 and 2020 who will face unprecedented exposure to climate extremes in their lifetime.

Generational impact of climate change

The younger a person is, the higher their likelihood of unprecedented exposure to climate extremes. Even if we successfully limit global warming to 1.5°C, 52% of children born in 2020 will face unprecedented heatwave exposure, compared to only 16% of those born in 1960. For heatwaves, the effect is particularly pronounced for those born after 1980, when climate change scenarios increasingly dictate exposure levels.

""By stabilizing our climate around 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, about half of today's young people will be exposed to an unprecedented number of heatwaves in their lifetime. Under a 3.5 °C scenario, over 90% will endure such exposure throughout their lives,"" warns Grant. ""The same picture emerges for other climate extremes examined, though with slightly lower affected fractions of the population. Yet the same unfair generational differences in unprecedented exposure is observed."" Children in tropical countries will bear the worst burden under a 1.5 °C scenario. However, under high-emission scenarios, nearly all children worldwide face the prospect of living an unprecedented life (see Figure 2).

Climate vulnerability and social injustice

The study also highlights the social injustice of climate change and its impacts. Under current climate policies, the most socioeconomically vulnerable children born in 2020 will almost all (95%) endure unprecedented exposure to heatwaves in their lifetime, compared to 78% for the least vulnerable group. ""Precisely the most vulnerable children experience the worst escalation of climate extremes. With limited resources and adaptation options, they face disproportionate risks,"" says Thiery.

Urgent Need for Global Climate Action

Ahead of COP30 in Brazil, nations must submit updated climate commitments. Under current policies, global warming would reach around 2.7 °C this century. This study and the related Save The Children report emphasize the urgency of keeping global warming below 1.5 °C for the children of today and tomorrow.

Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said: ""Across the world, children are forced to bear the brunt of a crisis they are not responsible for. Dangerous heat that puts their health and learning at risk; cyclones that batter their homes and schools; creeping droughts that shrivel up crops and shrink what's on their plates. Amid this daily drumbeat of disasters, children plead with us not to switch off. This new research shows there is still hope, but only if we act urgently and ambitiously to rapidly limit warming temperatures to 1.5 °C, and truly put children front and centre of our response to climate change.""

""With global emissions still rising and the planet only 0.2 °C away from the 1.5 °C threshold, world leaders must step up to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the climate burden on today's youth,"" concludes Thiery.

The study was accomplished by researchers from Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Environment and Climate Change Canada, KU Leuven, the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI), and ETH Zurich.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250430142233.htm,"An experiment seven years in the making has uncovered new insights into the nature of consciousness and challenges two prominent, competing scientific theories: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). The findings were published today in Nature and mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness.

IIT suggests that consciousness emerges when information inside a system (like the brain) is highly connected and unified, for as long as the information is consciously perceived, acting as a single whole. On the other hand, GNWT suggests a network of brain areas will spotlight important pieces of information in the brain -- bringing it to the forefront of our minds -- broadcasting it widely the moment it enters consciousness, and this produces conscious experience. The two competing theories were tested against one another in 2019 in a collaborative experiment involving 256 human subjects, and the findings were just released.

""Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute's mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,"" said Christof Koch, Ph.D., meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute. ""Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.""

The Findings

Research showed that there's functional connection between neurons in early visual areas of the brain (the areas that process vision, which are at the back of the brain) and the frontal areas of the brain, helping us understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts. The findings de-emphasize the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it's important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception. In other words, intelligence is about doing while consciousness is about being.

This discovery has implications for how we understand consciousness and may shed light on disorders of consciousness such as comas or vegetative states. Identifying where consciousness comes from could help detect ""covert consciousness"" in unresponsive patients with severe injuries -- a condition known to occur in about one-quarter of cases as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year.

Neither Theory Came Out on Top

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) says consciousness comes from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work together to integrate information, like teamwork. It arises from how these parts are connected and how they share information with each other rather than any one individual area or part of the brain generating consciousness. The study, however, did not find enough lasting connections in the back of the brain to support this idea. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) supports the idea that consciousness happens in the front of the brain, but the study didn't find enough support for this idea either.

""It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory. The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another,"" said Anil Seth, Ph.D., a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex. ""Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable -- much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from.

The study involved 256 subjects, which is unprecedented for this kind of experiment. Researchers showed them various visual stimuli and then used three common human brain measurement tools that track blood flow as well as magnetic and electrical activity to study their brains while they looked at the stimuli.

The highly collaborative experiment is the result of a large-scale, open science collaboration that began at a workshop at the Allen Institute in 2018. This innovative approach brought together researchers with differing perspectives to test two theories in a collaborative, yet critical, environment aimed at reducing confirmation bias and accelerating scientific progress.

""Adversarial collaborations are a powerful social process, little used because of its challenging nature, within any field that has competing theories,"" said Koch. ""The bio-medical field could hugely profit by 'friendly' competition among theories -- neurobiological or others. But it requires a great deal of cooperation and work.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250429103143.htm,"Daily exposure to certain chemicals used to make plastic household items could be linked to more than 356,000 global deaths from heart disease in 2018 alone, a new analysis of population surveys shows.

While the chemicals, called phthalates, are in widespread use globally, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific bore a much larger share of the death toll than others -- about three-fourths of the total.

For decades, experts have connected health problems to exposure to certain phthalates found in cosmetics, detergents, solvents, plastic pipes, bug repellants, and other products. When these chemicals break down into microscopic particles and are ingested, studies have linked them to an increased risk of conditions ranging from obesity and diabetes to fertility issues and cancer.

Led by researchers at NYU Langone Health, the current study focused on a kind of phthalate called di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which is used to make food containers, medical equipment, and other plastic softer and more flexible. Exposure has been shown in other studies to prompt an overactive immune response (inflammation) in the heart's arteries, which, over time, is associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke. In their new analysis, the authors estimated that DEHP exposure contributed to 356,238 deaths, or more than 13% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64.

""By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,"" said study lead author Sara Hyman, BS, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

According to the authors, the resulting economic burden from the deaths identified in their study was estimated to be around $510 billion and may have reached as high as $3.74 trillion.

In a past study from 2021, the research team tied phthalates to more than 50,000 premature deaths each year, mostly from heart disease, among older Americans. Their latest investigation is believed to be the first global estimate to date of cardiovascular mortality -- or indeed any health outcome -- resulting from exposure to the chemicals, says Hyman, who is also a graduate student at NYU School of Public Global Health.

A report on the findings is publishing online April 29 in the journal Lancet eBiomedicine.

For the research, the team used health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys to estimate DEHP exposure across 200 countries and territories. The information included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by the plastic additive. Mortality data was obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research group in the US that collects medical information worldwide to identify trends in public health.

Among the key findings, the study showed that losses in the combined region of East Asia and the Middle East and the combined region of East Asia and the Pacific accounted, respectively, for about 42% and 32% of the mortality from heart disease linked to DEHP. Specifically, India had the highest death count at 103,587 deaths, followed by China and Indonesia. The larger heart death risks in these populations held true even after the researchers adjusted their statistical analysis to take into account population size within the studied age group.

A possible explanation, the authors say, is that these countries face higher rates of exposure to the chemicals, possibly because they are undergoing a boom in plastic production but with fewer manufacturing restrictions than other regions.

""There is a clear disparity in which parts of the world bear the brunt of heightened heart risks from phthalates,"" said study senior author Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP. ""Our results underscore the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins, especially in areas most affected by rapid industrialization and plastic consumption,"" added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

Trasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health, cautions that the analysis was not designed to establish that DEHP directly or alone caused heart disease and that higher death risks did not take into account other types of phthalates. Nor did it include mortality among those in other age groups. As a result, the overall death toll from heart disease connected to these chemicals is likely much higher, he says.

Trasande says that the researchers next plan to track how reductions in phthalate exposure may, over time, affect global mortality rates, as well as to expand the study to other health concerns posed by the chemicals, such as preterm birth. Trasande also serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Division of Environmental Pediatrics and the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.

Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grant P2CES033423. Further study funding was provided by Beyond Petrochemicals.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250428222323.htm,"A study analyzing data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) shows that premature deaths attributable to consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) increase significantly according to their share in individuals' total energy intake. The new study, appearing in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier, reinforces the call for global action to reduce UPF consumption, supported by regulatory and fiscal policies that foster healthier environments.

UPFs are ready-to-eat-or-heat industrial formulations that are made with ingredients extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories, with little or no whole foods in their composition. These have gradually been replacing traditional foods and meals made from fresh and minimally processed ingredients.

Lead investigator of the study Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, DSc, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazil, says, ""UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavors and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all-causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.""

While previous studies focused on specific dietary risk factors instead of food patterns, the current study modeled data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) to link dietary patterns, considering the extent and purpose of industrial food processing, to deaths from all causes.

Dr. Nilson explains, ""We first estimated a linear association between the dietary share of UPFs and all-cause mortality, so that each 10% increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by 3%. Then, using the relative risks and the food consumption data for all countries (ranging from 15% of the total energy intake in Colombia, to over 50% of the calories in the United States), we built a model that estimated that the percentage of all-cause premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption. For example, in 2018, 124,000 premature deaths were attributable to the consumption of UPFs in the United States.""

High consumption of UPFs has been associated with 32 different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, some types of cancer, and depression. For the first time, this study has estimated the burden of UPF intake on premature deaths from all-causes in different countries, showing that the attributable mortality is significant in all settings and that addressing UPF consumption should be a global public nutrition priority.

Dr. Nilson notes, ""It is concerning that, while in high-income countries UPF consumption is already high but relatively stable for over a decade, in low- and middle-income countries the consumption has continuously increased, meaning that while the attributable burden in high-income countries is currently higher, it is growing in the other countries. This shows that policies that disincentivize the consumption of UPFs are urgently needed globally, promoting traditional dietary patterns based on local fresh and minimally processed foods.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250425113336.htm,"It's no secret that our waistlines often expand in middle-age, but the problem isn't strictly cosmetic. Belly fat accelerates aging and slows down metabolism, increasing our risk for developing diabetes, heart problems and other chronic diseases. Exactly how age transforms a six pack into a softer stomach, however, is murky.

Now preclinical research by City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States and a leading research center for diabetes and other life-threatening illnesses, has uncovered the cellular culprit behind age-related abdominal fat, providing new insights into why our midsections widen with middle age. Published today in Science, the findings suggest a novel target for future therapies to prevent belly flab and extend our healthy lifespans.

""People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age -- even when their body weight remains the same,"" saidQiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., the study's co-corresponding author and an associate professor of molecular and cellular endocrinology at City of Hope'sArthur Riggs Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute, one of the world's foremost scientific organizations dedicated to investigating the biology and treatment of diabetes. ""We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body's massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly.""

In collaboration with the UCLA laboratory co-corresponding author Xia Yang, Ph.D., the scientists conducted a series of mouse experiments later validated on human cells. Wang and her colleagues focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain.

While it's well-known that fat cells grow larger with age, the scientists suspected that WAT also expanded by producing new fat cells, meaning it may have an unlimited potential to grow.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells.

The City of Hope team first transplanted APCs from young and older mice into a second group of young mice. The APCs from the older animals rapidly generated a colossal amount of fat cells.

When the team transplanted APCs from young mice into the older mice, however, the stem cells did not manufacture many new fat cells. The results confirmed that older APCs are equipped to independently make new fat cells, regardless of their host's age.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the scientists next compared APC gene activity in young and older mice. While barely active in young mice, APCs woke up with a vengeance in middle-aged mice and began pumping out new fat cells.

""While most adult stem cells' capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs -- aging unlocks these cells' power to evolve and spread,"" said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., the Ruth B. & Robert K. Lanman Endowed Chair in Gene Regulation & Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope. ""This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs' high output of new fat cells.""

Aging also transformed the APCs into a new type of stem cell called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). Arising in middle age, CP-A cells actively churn out new fat cells, explaining why older mice gain more weight.

A signaling pathway called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) proved critical for promoting these CP-A cells to multiply and evolve into fat cells.

""We discovered that the body's fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don't require this signal to make fat, older mice do,"" explained Wang. ""Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand belly fat in older mice.""

Using single-cell RNA sequencing on samples from people of various ages, Wang and her colleagues next studied APCs from human tissue in the lab. Again, the team also identified similar CP-A cells that had an increased number in middle-aged people's tissue. Their discovery also illustrates that CP-As in humans have high capacity in creating new fat cells.

""Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity,"" said Wang. ""Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity.""

Future research will focus on tracking CP-A cells in animal models, observing CP-A cells in humans and developing new strategies that eliminate or block the cells to prevent age-related fat gain.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250423111908.htm,"Knowing how human DNA changes over generations is essential to estimating genetic disease risks and understanding how we evolved. But some of the most changeable regions of our DNA have been off-limits to researchers -- until now.

A team of researchers from University of Utah Health, University of Washington, PacBio, and other institutions has used multiple DNA sequencing technologies to develop the most comprehensive atlas yet of genetic change through generations. The new investigation revealed that parts of the human genome change much faster than was previously known, laying the foundations for new insights into the roots of human disease and evolution.

""It's mutations that ultimately differentiate us from other species,"" says author Lynn Jorde, PhD. ""We're getting at a very basic property of what makes us human.""

The biological ""speed of light""

By comparing the genomes of parents to their children, the researchers could detect how often new mutations occurred and were passed down, a rate that Jorde says is as fundamental to understanding human biology as the speed of light is for understanding physics. ""This is something you really need to know -- the speed at which variation comes into our species,"" says Jorde, professor of human genetics in the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine (SFESOM) at the University of Utah. ""All of the genetic variation that we see from individual to individual is a result of these mutations."" Over time, these changes have led to everything from differences in our eye color to the ability to digest lactose to rare genetic diseases.

The researchers estimate that every human has nearly 200 new genetic changes that are different from either parent. Many of these changes occur in regions of DNA that are especially difficult to study.

Aaron Quinlan, PhD, professor and chair of human genetics in SFESOM and an author on the study, says that previous efforts to study human genetic change were limited to the parts of the genome that mutate the least. But the new study used advanced sequencing technologies to reveal the most rapidly changing regions of human DNA -- regions that Quinlan describes as ""previously untouchable.""

""We saw parts of our genome that are crazy mutable, almost a mutation every generation,"" he says. Other segments of DNA were more stable.

Jorde says that the new resource can be an important support for genetic counseling by helping answer the question, ""If you have a child who's affected with a disease, is it likely to be inherited from a parent, or is it likely to be a new mutation?"" Diseases caused by changes in ""mutation hotspots"" are more likely to be unique to the child, rather than having been passed down from their parents. This means that the risk of the parents having other kids with the same disease is lower. But if a genetic change was inherited from the parents, those parents' future kids have a higher risk of having the disease.

The platinum pedigree

The researchers' discovery hinged on a Utah family that has worked with genetics researchers since the 1980s as part of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain consortium, proving invaluable for the Human Genome Project.

Four generations of the family have donated DNA and consented to its analysis, which allowed the researchers an extraordinarily in-depth look at how new changes arise and are inherited from parents to children. ""A large family with this breadth and depth is an incredibly unique and valuable resource,"" says Deborah Neklason, PhD, research associate professor of internal medicine in SFESOM and an author on the study. ""It helps us understand variation and changes to the genome over generations in incredible detail.""

The best of both worlds

To get a complete, high-resolution picture of genetic variation over time, the team sequenced each person's DNA using multiple different technologies. Some technologies are best for detecting the smallest possible changes to DNA; others can scan enormous swaths of DNA at a time to find big changes and see parts of the genome that are otherwise difficult to sequence. By sequencing the same genomes with multiple technologies, the researchers achieved the best of both worlds: accuracy on both a small and large scale.

In future work, the researchers hope to extend their comprehensive sequencing techniques to more people to see if the genetic rate of change is different for different families. ""We saw really interesting stuff in this one family,"" Quinlan says. The next question is, ""How generalizable are those findings across families when trying to predict risk for disease or how genomes evolve?""

The sequencing results will be made freely available so that other researchers can use the data in their own studies, opening the door to further insights into human evolution and genetic disease.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250423111753.htm,"New multidisciplinary research led by Prof. Tomás Ryan from Trinity College Dublin shows that the brain forms memories of cold experiences and uses them to control our metabolism. This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain -- and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.

The discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders -- from obesity to cancer -- in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.

In 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment. He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.

Long-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain.

The researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place.

While memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University). They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.

Lead author of the article published today in the journal, Nature,, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4oC with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts. After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature. Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were ""expecting"" the environment to be cold.

Having established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus. Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat. And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.

Dr Muñoz Zamora, said: ""We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body's metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future.""

Prof. Lynch added: ""A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue -- or brown fat -- which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain. Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold.""

Dr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: ""Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to test whether the manipulation of cold memories in humans could provide novel avenues for altering metabolism for therapeutic purposes.""

This research opens many new doors for further discovery research, as well as the development of treatments. Understanding how representations of cold experiences affect broader brain functions such as emotion, decision-making, and social behaviour will provide insights into the embodied nature of the mind, for example.

""The sophisticated aspects of our minds evolved from more basic, visceral, bodily representations,"" said Prof. Ryan. ""Understanding how these components of our brain affect our behaviour in general is crucial to understanding our emotions and our use of memory.""

""This integrative piece of work offers a quintessential example of inter-disciplinary science. Neuroscience requires collaboration and it was the synergy with Prof. Lynch that allowed the unusual combination of memory engram work with metabolism research.""",Science
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610230533.htm,"Cells taken from the lungs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a larger accumulation of soot-like carbon deposits compared to cells taken from people who smoke but do not have COPD, according to a study published today, June 10, in ERJ Open Research. Carbon can enter the lungs via cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust and polluted air.

The cells, called alveolar macrophages, normally protect the body by engulfing any particles or bacteria that reach the lungs. But, in their new study, researchers found that when these cells are exposed to carbon they grow larger and encourage inflammation.

The research was led by Dr James Baker and Dr Simon Lea from the University of Manchester, UK. Dr Baker said: ""COPD is a complex disease that has a number of environmental and genetic risk factors. One factor is exposure to carbon from smoking or breathing polluted air.

""We wanted to study what happens in the lungs of COPD patients when this carbon builds up in alveolar macrophage cells, as this may influence the cells' ability to protect the lungs.""

The researchers used samples of lung tissue from surgery for suspected lung cancer. They studied samples (that did not contain any cancer cells) from 28 people who had COPD and 15 people who were smokers but did not have COPD.

Looking specifically at alveolar macrophage cells under a microscope, the researchers measured the sizes of the cells and the amount of carbon accumulated in the cells.

They found that the average amount of carbon was more than three times greater in alveolar macrophage cells from COPD patients compared to smokers. Cells containing carbon were consistently larger than cells with no visible carbon.

Patients with larger deposits of carbon in their alveolar macrophages had worse lung function, according to a measure called FEV1%, which quantifies how much and how forcefully patients can breathe out.

When the researchers exposed macrophages to carbon particles in the lab, they saw the cells become much larger and found that they were producing higher levels of proteins that lead to inflammation.

Dr Lea said: ""As we compared cells from COPD patients with cells from smokers, we can see that this build-up of carbon is not a direct result of cigarette smoking. Instead, we show alveolar macrophages in COPD patients contain more carbon and are inherently different in terms of their form and function compared to those in smokers.

""Our research raises an interesting question as to the cause of the increased levels of carbon in COPD patients' macrophages. It could be that people with COPD are less able to clear the carbon they breathe in. It could also be that people exposed to more particulate matter are accumulating this carbon and developing COPD as a result.

""In future, it would be interesting to study how this carbon builds up and how lung cells respond over a longer period of time.""

He said: ""This set of experiments suggest that people with COPD accumulate unusually large amounts of carbon in the cells of their lungs. This build-up seems to be altering those cells, potentially causing inflammation in the lungs and leading to worse lung function.

""In addition, this research offers some clues about why polluted air might cause or worsen COPD. However, we know that smoking and air pollution are risk factors for COPD and other lung conditions, so we need to reduce levels of pollution in the air we breathe and we need to help people to quit smoking.""",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250610004101.htm,"Creatine, the supplement popular with athletes for its ability to help build strength and power, is increasingly being recognized for its broad health benefits.

The compound's usefulness extends well beyond the gym, according to Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab at Texas A&M University. Kreider has spent more than 30 years investigating the effects of creatine, a naturally occurring compound stored in the muscle that combines with phosphate to form creatine phosphate, which is needed for cellular energy.

""When the body is stressed, like in exercise or under metabolic conditions like some diseases, creatine phosphate is needed to maintain energy in the cell, and therefore has a lot of protective and health benefits, in addition to the exercise performance effects that have been seen,"" Kreider said.

How Much Creatine Do We Need?

Our bodies create about a gram per day, but it's recommended to get two to four grams of creatine per day, depending on muscle mass and activity levels. According to Kreider, most people fall short of getting enough creatine from diet alone. The best sources of creatine in the diet are meat and fish.

""You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it's expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,"" Kreider said. This is why supplementation matters, especially for vegetarians or vegans who do not consume enough creatine in their diet.

For athletes with performance-related goals, Kreider said it's recommended to supplement 5 grams, four times a day for a week. Supplementation ""helps load the muscle up with more energy,"" which makes for improved high-intensity exercise, recovery and even cognitive function. After that, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day will maintain creatine stores and provide enough creatine for the brain.

Beyond boosting athletic performance, creatine is important for everyone as they age throughout their lives, Kreider said. It can help older adults who lose muscle mass and cognitive function as they age, he said, and in adolescents, low dietary creatine intake is associated with slower growth, less muscle mass and higher body fat.

Is Creatine Safe?

In a comprehensive review published in February in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, Kreider and colleagues analyzed 685 clinical trials on creatine supplementation to assess its safety and the frequency of reported side effects. The analysis showed there were no significant differences in the rate of side effects for participants taking a placebo and those taking creatine.

As for anecdotal concerns like bloating or cramping, Kreider says those claims don't hold up under scrutiny, and studies have shown creatine can actually prevent cramping because it helps the body retain more fluid.

Despite the strong evidence base, Kreider said creatine has long been the subject of misconceptions and misinformation. He's among the members of the International Society of Sports Nutrition who recently issued a letter affirming the safety and efficacy of creatine, urging lobbyists and policymakers not to restrict access to it.

""There's absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,"" he said. ""Creatine is safe, and it's important for everybody, not just bodybuilders and athletes.""",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250609060137.htm,"A new study led by Keck Medicine of USC researchers may have uncovered an effective combination therapy for glioblastoma, a brain tumor diagnosis with few available effective treatments. According to the National Brain Tumor Society, the average survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is eight months.

The study finds that using Tumor Treating Fields therapy (TTFields), which delivers targeted waves of electric fields directly into tumors to stop their growth and signal the body's immune system to attack cancerous tumor cells, may extend survival among patients with glioblastoma, when combined with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (temozolomide).

TTFields disrupt tumor growth using low-intensity, alternating electric fields that push and pull key structures inside tumor cells in continually shifting directions, making it difficult for the cells to multiply. Preventing tumor growth gives patients a better chance of successfully fighting the cancer. When used to treat glioblastoma, TTFields are delivered through a set of mesh electrodes that are strategically positioned on the scalp, generating fields at a precise frequency and intensity focused on the tumor. Patients wear the electrodes for approximately 18 hours a day.

Researchers observed that TTFields attract more tumor-fighting T cells, which are white blood cells that identify and attack cancer cells, into and around the glioblastoma. When followed by immunotherapy, these T cells stay active longer and are replaced by even stronger, more effective tumor-fighting T cells.

""By using TTFields with immunotherapy, we prime the body to mount an attack on the cancer, which enables the immunotherapy to have a meaningful effect in ways that it could not before,"" said David Tran, MD, PhD, chief of neuro-oncology with Keck Medicine, co-director of the USC Brain Tumor Center and corresponding author of the study. ""Our findings suggest that TTFields may be the key to unlocking the value of immunotherapy in treating glioblastoma.""

TTFields are often combined with chemotherapy in cancer treatment. However, even with aggressive treatment, the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. Immunotherapy, while successful in many other cancer types, has also not proved effective for glioblastoma when used on its own.

However, in this study, adding immunotherapy to TTFields and chemotherapy was associated with a 70% increase in overall survival. Notably, patients with larger, unresected (not surgically removed) tumors showed an even stronger immune response to TTFields and lived even longer. This suggests that, when it comes to kick-starting the body's immune response against the cancer, having a larger tumor may provide more targets for the therapy to work against.

Using alternating electric fields to unlock immunotherapy

Pembrolizumab, the immunotherapy used in this study, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), which enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancers by improving T cells' ability to identify and attack cancer cells.

However, there are typically few T cells in and around glioblastomas because these tumors originate in the brain and are shielded from the body's natural immune response by the blood-brain barrier. This barrier safeguards the brain by tightly regulating which cells and substances enter from the bloodstream. Sometimes, this barrier even blocks T cells and other therapies that could help kill brain tumors.

This immunosuppressive environment inside and around the glioblastoma is what makes common cancer therapies like pembrolizumab and chemotherapy significantly less effective in treating it. Tran theorized the best way to get around this issue was to start an immune reaction directly inside the tumor itself, an approach known as in situ immunization, using TTFields.

This study demonstrates that combining TTFields with immunotherapy triggers a potent immune response within the tumor -- one that ICIs can then amplify to bolster the body's own defense against cancer.

""Think of it like a team sport -- immunotherapy sends players in to attack the tumor (the offense), while TTFields weaken the tumor's ability to fight back (the defense). And just like in team sports, the best defense is a good offense,"" said Tran, who is also a member of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Study methodology and results

The study analyzed data from 2-THE-TOP, a Phase 2 clinical trial, which enrolled 31 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients who had completed chemoradiation therapy. Of those, 26 received TTFields combined with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Seven of these 26 patients had inoperable tumors due to their locations -- an especially high-risk subgroup with the worst prognosis and few treatment options.

Patients in the trial were given six to 12 monthly treatments of chemotherapy alongside TTFields for up to 24 months. The number and duration of treatments were determined by patients' response to treatment. The immunotherapy was given every three weeks, starting with the second dose of chemotherapy, for up to 24 months.

Patients who used the device alongside chemotherapy and immunotherapy lived approximately 10 months longer than patients who had used the device with chemotherapy alone in the past. Moreover, those with large, inoperable tumors lived approximately 13 months longer and showed much stronger immune activation compared to patients who underwent surgical removal of their tumors.

""Further studies are needed to determine the optimal role of surgery in this setting, but these findings may offer hope, particularly for glioblastoma patients who do not have surgery as an option,"" said Tran.

Moving the research forward

Keck Medicine is participating in the multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial to validate the efficacy of TTFields with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Tran, who has been researching TTFields for more than a decade, serves as the chair of the steering committee for this trial. Frances Chow, MD, neuro-oncologist with USC Norris, is the principal investigator of the Keck Medicine study site.

This Phase 3 trial, currently open at 28 sites across the United States, Europe and Israel, aims to enroll over 740 patients through April 2029, including those with gross total resection, partial resection or biopsy-only tumors to assess the extent of how surgically removing tumors influences immune response.

Videos 'emphasize lighter, brighter skin' and set a high standard of beauty

rs, authors caution only 26% of daytime skin care regimens contain sunscreen

It turns out when teens on TikTok say, ""Get ready with me,"" it can be more harmful than they might realize.

In the first peer-reviewed study to examine the potential risks and benefits of teen skin-care routines posted on social media, scientists at Northwestern Medicine found girls ages 7 to 18 are using an average of six different products on their faces, with some girls using more than a dozen products. These products tend to be marketed heavily to younger consumers and carry a high risk of skin irritation and allergy, the study found.

The findings will be published June 9 in the journal Pediatrics.

Each teen daily skin-care regimen costs an average of $168 (which the authors estimate typically lasts a month depending on the size of the products), with some costing more than $500, the study found. As the summer nears, the study authors cautioned only 26% ofdaytime skin care regimens included sunscreen -- arguably the most important skin care product for any age range, but particularly for kids.

The top-viewed videos contained an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients, the study found, putting the content creators at risk of developing skin irritation, sun sensitivity and a skin allergy known as allergic contact dermatitis. Prior evidence has shown that developing such an allergy can limit the kinds of soaps, shampoos and cosmetics users can apply for the rest of their lives.

""That high risk of irritation came from both using multiple active ingredients at the same time, such as hydroxy acids, as well as applying the same active ingredient unknowingly over and over again when that active ingredient was found in three, four, five different products,"" said corresponding author Dr. Molly Hales, a postdoctoral research fellow and board-certified dermatologist in the department of dermatology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

For example, in one video included in the study, the content creator applied 10 products on her face in six minutes.

""As she's applying the products, she begins to express discomfort and burning, and in the final few minutes, she develops a visible skin reaction,"" said senior author Dr. Tara Lagu, adjunct lecturer of medicine and medical social sciences at Feinberg and a former Northwestern Medicine hospitalist.

Videos 'emphasized lighter, brighter skin'

""We saw that there was preferential, encoded racial language in some cases that really emphasized lighter, brighter skin,"" Lagu said. ""I think there also were real associations between use of these regimens and consumerism.""

These videos offer little to no benefit for the pediatric populations they're targeting, the study authors concluded. What's more, given how the algorithms work, it's nearly impossible for parents or pediatricians to track exactly what children or adolescents are viewing. Lastly, there are dangers beyond skin damage, Hales said.

""It's problematic to show girls devoting this much time and attention to their skin,"" Hales said. ""We're setting a very high standard for these girls. The pursuit of health has become a kind of virtue in our society, but the ideal of 'health' is also very wrapped up in ideals of beauty, thinness and whiteness. The insidious thing about 'skin care' is that it claims to be about health.""

Studying teens in the TikTok environment

In the study, Hales and another researcher each created a new TikTok account, reporting themselves to be 13 years old. The ""For You"" tab was used to view relevant content until 100 unique videos were compiled. They collected demographics of content creators, number and types of products used and total cost of regimens and then created a list of products used and their active and inactive ingredients. The Pediatric Baseline Series used in patch testing was used to identify ingredients with elevated risk of inducing allergic contact dermatitis.

Funding for the study was provided by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (grant number 5T32AR060710-11). Other Northwestern authors include Drs. Amy Paller and Walter Liszewski, and medical student Sarah Rigali.",Technology

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250607231604.htm,"Marijuana use among older adults in the US has reached a new high, with 7 percent of adults aged 65 and over who report using it in the past month, according to an analysis led by researchers with the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research (CDUHR) at the NYU School of Global Public Health.

Their findings, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, also show that the profile of those who use cannabis has changed in recent years, with pronounced increases in use by older adults who are college-educated, married, female, and have higher incomes.

""Our study shows that cannabis use among older adults continues to increase, although there have been major shifts in use according to demographic and socioeconomic factors,"" said Joseph Palamar, PhD, MPH, an associate professor of population health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, an affiliated researcher with CDUHR, and the study's senior author.

Most Americans live in a state where marijuana has been legalized for medical use, recreational use, or both. To better understand the prevalence of marijuana use among older adults in the US, researchers examined data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2021 through 2023. The respondents, who were 65 and older, were asked about past-month cannabis use, which was defined as ""current"" use.

""This is the first time we were able to examine 'current' use of cannabis in this age group. Before, we were only able to look at past-year use because the numbers for current use were too small,"" said Benjamin Han, MD, MPH, associate professor and associate chief of research in the Division of Geriatrics, Gerontology, and Palliative Care at the University of California San Diego and the study's first author.

The researchers found that current cannabis use among older adults grew to 7 percent in 2023, up from 4.8 percent in 2021 and 5.2 percent in 2022 -- a nearly 46 percent increase in only two years.

""If we look even further back to 2006 and 2007, less than 1 percent of older adults used cannabis in the past year. Now, we're seeing that 7 percent have used it in the past month alone,"" said Han, an affiliated researcher with CDUHR.

Certain groups of older adults experienced sharper increases in use over this period than others, including those who are married, white, have a college degree, and have an income of at least $75,000. Older women also saw a steep increase in cannabis use, although older men are still more likely than women to use the drug.

In addition, cannabis use grew more among those living in states where medical marijuana is legal versus states where it is not.

""It shouldn't be surprising that use is becoming increasingly more common among people who live in states that allow medical cannabis, which could be due to increased availability or social acceptability,"" said Palamar. ""Interestingly, with respect to income, those with the highest incomes had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use in 2021, but by 2023 this group had the highest prevalence, which may indicate who has access to medical cannabis given its costs.""

The researchers also found significant increases in cannabis use by older adults with chronic diseases -- and notably, those with multiple chronic conditions -- including heart issues, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease.

The authors caution that the overall increases may be driven, in part, by those who use cannabis aging into the 65+ age bracket for the period studied. Regardless, they recommend that clinicians screen and educate their older patients about cannabis use, including how physiological changes that accompany aging can make people more sensitive to psychoactive substances.

""As a geriatrician, I see more and more people interested in using cannabis for treating chronic health symptoms. But cannabis can complicate the management of chronic diseases and be potentially harmful if patients are not educated on its use and potential risks,"" said Han.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603172911.htm,"Using a newly devised, three-dimensional model to study the regeneration of nerve tissue in the nose, researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) and colleagues have discovered that one type of stem cell thought to be dormant may play a more significant role in preserving the sense of smell than originally believed.

Unlike cells in the central nervous system, sensory neurons in the nasal cavity have a remarkable ability to regenerate throughout life despite near constant exposure to the outside environment.

Viral infections such as COVID-19, exposure to toxins, or even aging itself can diminish their function or the ability of these cells to replicate, which can lead to a partial or complete loss of smell. The team of researchers devised a new, easy-to-create, three-dimensional olfactory tissue mouse model or organoid to help scientists better study how neurons are continually formed in the nose and why this process might decline in disease and aging.

Their research, published recently in Cell Reports Methods, uses this mouse model to show how two types of stem cells in the nose, called horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), communicate and support each other to develop new smell-sensing nerve tissue.

""Our research suggests that these two stem cells may be interdependent,"" says Brian Lin, senior author on the study and a research assistant professor in the Department of Developmental, Molecular and Chemical Biology. ""One type that we thought was largely dormant -- HBCs -- may actually play a crucial role in supporting the production of new neurons and the repair of damaged tissue.""

Using this model, the team identified a specific subpopulation of HBCs, marked by their production of the protein KRT5, that actively support the generation of new olfactory neurons. The researchers observed that these particular HBCs play a key role in the formation of the organoids, and they found that when these cells were selectively depleted from the organoid cultures, the generation of new neurons was significantly impaired. These results suggest that these stem cells, once thought to be dormant, are essential players in the regenerative process.

""We also looked at cells from mice of different ages and grew them in the model,"" Lin says. ""We found a decline in the ability of the older mice cells to generate new neurons. We think this is due to a decrease in the GBC population as we age, but we need to do more work to test this hypothesis and if so, develop ways to rejuvenate them.""

An Easy-To-Use Model

Lead author of the study, Juliana Gutschow Gameiro, a former Ph.D. student visiting GSBS, came to Tufts from the State University of Londrina, Parana, in Brazil. Lin says she was dedicated to developing a model that was easy to create in labs with limited funds and equipment.

""Because loss of smell is associated with COVID-19, as well as with Parkinson's disease and other conditions, a much larger number of researchers from a variety of different fields have begun researching olfactory epithelial cells in the last few years,"" says Lin.

""We wanted to develop an easy-to-use model so that non-stem cell biologists and those working in labs with limited resources could use it to better understand how olfactory neurons regenerate and what happens that causes that process to diminish or fail completely,"" he says.

Next Step: A Human Organoid

The ultimate goal is to use this mouse-tissue model of olfactory sensory neurons as a pathway to developing a human organoid that can be used to screen drugs to treat people whose sense of smell is significantly diminished or gone.

Organoids make pre-clinical trial research quicker, less expensive, and potentially more effective than using whole animals or existing human cell cultures. Organoids have already been developed for lungs, kidneys, and other organs, but not for human olfactory tissue.

""It's challenging to get pure olfactory tissue from humans,"" Lin says. Individuals are anesthetized and a brush similar to a COVID test wand is pushed deep into the nasal cavity. Unlike in their mouse model, human respiratory stem cells and olfactory stem cells collected in this process are difficult to separate.

The research team's next challenge is to develop a simple, inexpensive technique for separating out the human olfactory stem cells and coaxing them to grow in the lab.",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603172903.htm,"A new study from Pitt researchers challenges a decades-old assumption in neuroscience by showing that the brain uses distinct transmission sites -- not a shared site -- to achieve different types of plasticity. The findings, published in Science Advances, offer a deeper understanding of how the brain balances stability with flexibility, a process essential for learning, memory and mental health.

Neurons communicate through a process called synaptic transmission, where one neuron releases chemical messengers called neurotransmitters from a presynaptic terminal. These molecules travel across a microscopic gap called a synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on a neighboring postsynaptic neuron, triggering a response.

Traditionally, scientists believed spontaneous transmissions (signals that occur randomly) and evoked transmissions (signals triggered by sensory input or experience) originated from one type of canonical synaptic site and relied on shared molecular machinery. Using a mouse model, the research team -- led by Oliver Schlüter, associate professor of neuroscience in the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences -- discovered that the brain instead uses separate synaptic transmission sites to carry out regulation of these two types of activity, each with its own developmental timeline and regulatory rules.

""We focused on the primary visual cortex, where cortical visual processing begins,"" said Yue Yang, a research associate in the Department of Neuroscience and first author of the study. ""We expected spontaneous and evoked transmissions to follow a similar developmental trajectory, but instead, we found that they diverged after eye opening.""

As the brain began receiving visual input, evoked transmissions continued to strengthen. In contrast, spontaneous transmissions plateaued, suggesting that the brain applies different forms of control to the two signaling modes.

To understand why, the researchers applied a chemical that activates otherwise silent receptors on the postsynaptic side. This caused spontaneous activity to increase, while evoked signals remained unchanged -- strong evidence that the two types of transmission operate through functionally distinct synaptic sites.

This division likely enables the brain to maintain consistent background activity through spontaneous signaling while refining behaviorally relevant pathways through evoked activity. This dual system supports both homeostasis and Hebbian plasticity, the experience-dependent process that strengthens neural connections during learning.

""Our findings reveal a key organizational strategy in the brain,"" said Yang. ""By separating these two signaling modes, the brain can remain stable while still being flexible enough to adapt and learn.""

The implications could be broad. Abnormalities in synaptic signaling have been linked to conditions like autism, Alzheimer's disease and substance use disorders. A better understanding of how these systems operate in the healthy brain may help researchers identify how they become disrupted in disease.

""Learning how the brain normally separates and regulates different types of signals brings us closer to understanding what might be going wrong in neurological and psychiatric conditions,"" Yang said.",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603141208.htm,"The effects of artificial intelligence on adolescents are nuanced and complex, according to a report from the American Psychological Association that calls on developers to prioritize features that protect young people from exploitation, manipulation and the erosion of real-world relationships.

""AI offers new efficiencies and opportunities, yet its deeper integration into daily life requires careful consideration to ensure that AI tools are safe, especially for adolescents,"" according to the report, entitled ""Artificial Intelligence and Adolescent Well-being: An APA Health Advisory."" ""We urge all stakeholders to ensure youth safety is considered relatively early in the evolution of AI. It is critical that we do not repeat the same harmful mistakes made with social media.""

The report was written by an expert advisory panel and follows on two other APA reports on social media use in adolescence and healthy video content recommendations.

The AI report notes that adolescence -- which it defines as ages 10-25 -- is a long development period and that age is ""not a foolproof marker for maturity or psychological competence."" It is also a time of critical brain development, which argues for special safeguards aimed at younger users.

""Like social media, AI is neither inherently good nor bad,"" said APA Chief of Psychology Mitch Prinstein, PhD, who spearheaded the report's development. ""But we have already seen instances where adolescents developed unhealthy and even dangerous 'relationships' with chatbots, for example. Some adolescents may not even know they are interacting with AI, which is why it is crucial that developers put guardrails in place now.""

The report makes a number of recommendations to make certain that adolescents can use AI safely. These include:

Ensuring there are healthy boundaries with simulated human relationships. Adolescents are less likely than adults to question the accuracy and intent of information offered by a bot, rather than a human.

Creating age-appropriate defaults in privacy settings, interaction limits and content. This will involve transparency, human oversight and support and rigorous testing, according to the report.

Encouraging uses of AI that can promote healthy development. AI can assist in brainstorming, creating, summarizing and synthesizing information -- all of which can make it easier for students to understand and retain key concepts, the report notes. But it is critical for students to be aware of AI's limitations.

Limiting access to and engagement with harmful and inaccurate content. AI developers should build in protections to prevent adolescents' exposure to harmful content.

Protecting adolescents' data privacy and likenesses. This includes limiting the use of adolescents' data for targeted advertising and the sale of their data to third parties.

The report also calls for comprehensive AI literacy education, integrating it into core curricula and developing national and state guidelines for literacy education.

""Many of these changes can be made immediately, by parents, educators and adolescents themselves,"" Prinstein said. ""Others will require more substantial changes by developers, policymakers and other technology professionals.""

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250603141202.htm,"A new study by Emory University researchers, published Thursday in Environmental Science & Technology, found that exposure to the tiny particles in air pollution during pregnancy can disrupt maternal metabolisms, altering key biological pathways. These changes were associated with increased risk of various negative birth outcomes, including premature birth.

The study, which analyzed blood samples provided by 330 pregnant women from the Atlanta metropolitan area, is believed to be the first to investigate how exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) commonly found in air pollution affects the metabolism of pregnant women and contributes to increased risks of preterm and early term births.

""The link between air pollution and premature birth has been well established, but for the first time we were able to look at the detailed pathway and specific fine particles to identify how they are reflected in the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes,"" says Donghai Liang, PhD, study lead author and associate professor of environmental health at the Rollins School of Public Health. ""This is important because if we can figure out the 'why' and 'how' then we can know better how to address it.""

Why This Matters

Previous research has shown pregnant women and fetuses are more vulnerable than other populations to exposure to PM2.5 -- which is emitted from combustion sources such as vehicle exhaust, industrial processes, and wildfires -- including increased likelihood of preterm births (less than 37 weeks of gestation), which is the leading cause of death globally among children under the age of five. Preterm birth is also linked to complications such as cerebral palsy, respiratory distress syndrome, and long-term noncommunicable disease risks, while early term births (37-39 weeks of gestation) are also associated with increased neonatal morbidity and developmental challenges. Approximately 10% of the preterm births in the world are attributable to PM2.5 exposure.

Key Findings

This was the first study to uncover the specific pathways and molecules involved in energy and amino acid metabolism that may explain how exposure to PM2.5 contributes to preterm and early term births.

The researchers identified two substances -- cortexolone and lysoPE(20:3) -- as factors in the relationship between short-term air pollution exposure and elevated risk of early births, offering a potential mechanism through which air pollution triggers premature labor.

The study highlighted disruptions in protein digestion and absorption -- which are vital to fetal development and immune function -- as potential links between air pollution and early births, also offering new potential targets for prevention efforts.

Of the 330 women who participated in the Emory study, 66 (20%) delivered preterm babies and 54 (16.4%) delivered early term babies, both of which are significantly higher than the prevalence in the general U.S. population.

What The Experts Say

""As an air pollution scientist, I do not think air pollution is going away anytime soon. Even at lower levels, we continue to see harmful health effects, but we can't just ask people to simply move away from highly polluted areas,"" Liang says. ""So, from a clinical intervention standpoint, that's why it's critical to gain a better understanding on these pathways and molecules affected by pollution. In the future, we may be able to target some of these molecules to develop effective strategies or clinical interventions that could help reduce these adverse health effects.""",Science

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250602155325.htm,"Human-AI interactions are well understood in terms of trust and companionship. However, the role of attachment and experiences in such relationships is not entirely clear. In a new breakthrough, researchers from Waseda University have devised a novel self-report scale and highlighted the concepts of attachment anxiety and avoidance toward AI. Their work is expected to serve as a guideline to further explore human-AI relationships and incorporate ethical considerations in AI design.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous in this era. As a result, human-AI interactions are becoming more frequent and complex, and this trend is expected to accelerate soon. Therefore, scientists have made remarkable efforts to better understand human-AI relationships in terms of trust and companionship. However, these man-machine interactions can possibly also be understood in terms of attachment-related functions and experiences, which have traditionally been used to explain human interpersonal bonds.

In an innovative work, which incorporates two pilot studies and one formal study, a group of researchers from Waseda University, Japan, including Research Associate Fan Yang and Professor Atsushi Oshio from the Faculty of Letters, Arts and Sciences, has utilized attachment theory to examine human-AI relationships. Their findings were recently published online in the journal Current Psychology on May 9, 2025.

Mr. Yang explains the motivation behind their research. ""As researchers in attachment and social psychology, we have long been interested in how people form emotional bonds. In recent years, generative AI such as ChatGPT has become increasingly stronger and wiser, offering not only informational support but also a sense of security. These characteristics resemble what attachment theory describes as the basis for forming secure relationships. As people begin to interact with AI not just for problem-solving or learning, but also for emotional support and companionship, their emotional connection or security experience with AI demands attention. This research is our attempt to explore that possibility.""

Notably, the team developed a new self-report scale called the Experiences in Human-AI Relationships Scale, or EHARS, to measure attachment-related tendencies toward AI. They found that some individuals seek emotional support and guidance from AI, similar to how they interact with people. Nearly 75% of participants turned to AI for advice, while about 39% perceived AI as a constant, dependable presence.

This study differentiated two dimensions of human attachment to AI: anxiety and avoidance. An individual with high attachment anxiety toward AI needs emotional reassurance and harbors a fear of receiving inadequate responses from AI. In contrast, a high attachment avoidance toward AI is characterized by discomfort with closeness and a consequent preference for emotional distance from AI.

However, these findings do not mean that humans are currently forming genuine emotional attachments to AI. Rather, the study demonstrates that psychological frameworks used for human relationships may also apply to human-AI interactions. The present results can inform the ethical design of AI companions and mental health support tools. For instance, AI chatbots used in loneliness interventions or therapy apps could be tailored to different users' emotional needs, providing more empathetic responses for users with high attachment anxiety or maintaining respectful distance for users with avoidant tendencies. The results also suggest a need for transparency in AI systems that simulate emotional relationships, such as romantic AI apps or caregiver robots, to prevent emotional overdependence or manipulation.

Furthermore, the proposed EHARS could be used by developers or psychologists to assess how people relate to AI emotionally and adjust AI interaction strategies accordingly.

""As AI becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life, people may begin to seek not only information but also emotional support from AI systems. Our research highlights the psychological dynamics behind these interactions and offers tools to assess emotional tendencies toward AI. Lastly, it promotes a better understanding of how humans connect with technology on a societal level, helping to guide policy and design practices that prioritize psychological well-being,"" concludes Mr. Yang.",Technology

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:00:03 Welcome to Paging Dr. Gupta, one of my favorite times of the week. I really love hearing from you. You know, we've been doing this for a couple of months now. I love reading your questions, hearing your questions, gives me an idea of what's on your mind. Whether it's something in the headlines, sometimes it's something happening in your own life, I'm here to help try and break it down. And we've got a great first question lined up. Kyra, wanna do the honors?

Kyra Dahring 00:00:30 Absolutely. So, Paula in West Springfield, Massachusetts asks, in our household, we use filtered water coming out of the refrigerator. Does that eliminate the fluoride in the water?

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:00:41 'Okay, Paula, this is a great question. There's been a lot of news about fluoride lately. So let me give you a simple answer and then explain it. Most water filters are not going to remove fluoride. Keep in mind that fluoride is a mineral and it dissolves in the water, so it's actually quite hard to remove, to filter out. Most conventional filters are not going to do this. Now, there are a couple of ways to filter out fluoride. One is using something known as reverse osmosis, a reverse osmosis filter. This essentially is forcing the fluoridated water under pressure through a semi-permeable membrane. Reverse osmoses is about 80 to 90% effective at removing fluoride. Another type is distillation, a distilling filter. Now, this essentially is boiling the fluorodated water and then capturing the water vapor, that steam that gets produced, and leaving the fluoride behind and that's nearly a hundred percent effective. Now again, I know there's a lot of discussion about fluoride lately, but two things I just want to make sure you know: in most places around the country around the United States, Fluoride is not going to be at a level that is high enough for concern. So despite the fact that we're talking about it a lot lately, there really isn't a lot of cause for concern. Second thing, there are ways to sort of figure out how much fluoride is in your water. There is something called a consumer confidence report that you can get from your water company, they're obligated to give it to you if you ask for it. That can tell you how much fluoride in your water. You can also go to the CDC's website and look for ""My Water's Fluoride"" and plug in where you live, that can also give you an idea of how much fluoride's in your water. But again, Paula, I just want to be clear for most people living in the United States, this is not a concern.

Kyra Dahring 00:02:37 Okay wait, now Sanjay, let's just say the fluoride is removed from the drinking water. We have a question from a listener named Lucia in New York who wants to know if brushing her teeth with a fluoridated toothpaste or rinsing with a flouridated mouthwash, is that enough to protect her teeth?

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:02:53 Okay, yes, this is a great question. The short answer here is yes, fluoridated toothpaste or rinses are really effective at protecting teeth. One thing I just want to point out, if you look at the sort of overall impact of fluoridating water, the public health community often refers to that as one of the greatest public health achievements over the last century. And for good reason, it's made a huge impact. But at the same time, really since about 1975, the incremental benefit of fluoride in the water has gone considerably down. Why is that? Because around that time, 50 years ago, we started to have fluoridated toothpaste and more widespread access to dental care. So fluoridate toothpaste can make a huge difference. When you think about fluoridatied toothpaste, first of all, for children under the age of three, you don't need very much toothpaste, about a rice grain size amount of toothpaste is good for children under the age of three. That's not very much. And for adults, about a pea size amount a fluoridated toothpaste. When you're thinking about the fluoride, you want to make sure that it's sort of sticking to your teeth. And you don't want to rinse your teeth for a period of time after you brush your teeth, just let that fluoride sit on your teeth that's what allows it to of cause remineralization. Don't eat for 10 to 15 minutes afterward either. So no doubt then that brushing your teeth with a little bit of fluoridated toothpaste can make a huge difference. Now I will say that the impact of taking fluoride out of the water is a little bit hard to know. There have been some modeling studies, one came from a group of researchers at Harvard that basically predicted that over the next five years, if you remove fluoride from the water, it would lead to about 25 million excess cavities. Over 10 years, it would lead to about 54 million excess cavities, cavities being defined by something that needs a filling. So again, fluoridated toothpaste, fluoride rinses, they do a great job, but there's an impact as well at taking the fluoride out of the water.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:05:09 Okay, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, we're gonna talk about foods to eat to keep your mind sharp. Stay with us.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:05:23 Alright. I know that sound. Kyra, who's up next?

Kyra Dahring 00:05:26 Next up is Sam from Connecticut, and he has a question I think you're gonna love about brain food. Take a listen.

Listener Sam 00:05:34 Hi, my name is Sam and I'm 68 in Norwalk, Connecticut. I don't know if you've covered this in one of the podcasts that maybe I've missed, but I'd like to know what are the best foods you could eat to nourish your brain? Memory, response time, accuracy? Thanks, have a great day and thank you for all the wonderful information. Bye.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:05:58 Okay Sam, thank you for your question and I do love the fact that you're thinking about how to keep your brain sharp. As you know, I'm a neurosurgeon, I think about the brain all the time, the most enigmatic three and a half pounds of tissue in the known universe. Now, with regard to how we nourish ourselves and its relationship to brain health, there is some solid science behind certain foods that support memory and cognition. In fact, I sat down on a previous episode of Chasing Life with Dr. Uma Naidoo. She's a nutritional psychiatrist, by the way, how cool is that? A nutritional psychiatrist, she's also a professional chef and she really digs deep into how food affects the brain. Listen to what she told me.

Dr. Uma Naidoo 00:06:44 'Foods that will help cognition, we actually go back to those, those omega-3s, it's a group that's featured very frequently. Olive oil, also one that we lean into. The herbs and spices that showed up doing well for cognition and for thinking and for memory are turmeric with that pinch of black pepper, which makes it much more bioavailable, cinnamon, saffron, rosemary, ginger, sage.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:07:13 I hope you caught that last part. It's not only the specific foods, but also these added spices, which can make the foods much more bioavailable. If you eat foods that are good for you, but they're not highly bioavailable, that means they're not circulating around the body and the brain and doing their job. Now, Dr. Naidoo also gave us some great advice on caffeine and how, in moderation, it can actually help objectively with focus and memory.

Dr. Uma Naidoo 00:07:41 Coffee was thought, if you keep your caffeine's consumption, or your coffee consumption, under 400 milligrams a day, it was thought to be healthy.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:07:50 Now, I think it's important to point out that Dr. Naidoo's not just talking about these things as individual ingredients. Oftentimes we think of medicines as these single molecules, but when it comes to food, it's really about putting all these ingredients together into a meal that is tasty, but also brain healthy.

Dr. Uma Naidoo 00:08:10 You know, for me, this is some guidance. While I know that those foods have been identified as healthy, it's also part of an overall plate, right? It's not just eating the nuts or eating the olive oil, it's putting that together in a meal that's still tasty makes a very big difference to balancing that out for people.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta 00:08:28 'Beyond that, let me give you some of my thoughts on what the research shows about food and brain health. Studies have shown that eating just a handful of blueberries or a single serving of spinach or kale can slow cognitive decline by years even. There was this big study that tracked over 16,000 older women for 15 years and found that just a half a cup of blueberries, or a cup a strawberries a week, slowed memory loss by two and a half years. Another study found those who ate a serving of leafy greens, spinach, kale, collard greens, arugula, appeared many years younger in terms of their overall cognitive health compared with those who rarely or never consumed green leafy vegetables. Another one to add to the list, oily fish, salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines. They are all rich in something known as DHA. DHA is a fat that can help protect your brain. And then there was a study showing that eating fish just once a week was associated with slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of Alzheimer's. You know, I also want to mention eggs. They are packed with something known as choline, which is a key nutrient for memory and learning that many people just don't get enough of, eggs can be a great source. So Sam, if you're at the store, think about these foods, look for color in your foods, berries, greens, those brain-boosting spices Dr. Naidoo mentioned, turmeric, cinnamon, saffron, rosemary, ginger, sage, and don't forget your salmon. That's a big one. But remember again, it's about building meals around these components. Make them tasty and pack them with these ingredients, that's great way to support your brain health over time.",Entertainment
